I am checking on the final list of other panelists and will advise.  Finally, Andy Black of Chairman Barton\\'s staff advises that they will release draft RTO language as early as today.  We expect that this draft will not be to our liking.  Barton thinks FERC is moving too quickly and with too much force.  We expect his proposal to set a deadline of something like 12 months for utilities to join an RTO.  The key is in part whether he allows FERC to continue to decide what constitutes an acceptable RTO or whether he will try to \"grandfather\" in some fashion those RTOs that have been proposed by utilities to date.']\n",

I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich is covering FERC.  I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context.  He said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are tripling.  Frankly, we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else.  But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account).  I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions.  One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers should be encouraged to choose.  Those who did are doing fine.     \"]\n",

As I mentioned to Alice Weekley, I am unfamiliar with the recent amendments  referenced requiring the notice for projects that do not actually cross  reservation property. The amendment does not surprise me though.    In the past, for example, during the Transwestern expansion in \\'91, we  developed a comprehensive NAGPRA plan with tribes whose reservations we  crossed, yet neighboring tribes were included--the thinking by the various  State Historic Preservation officers was that unearthed remains (bones,  funerial objects, pottery pieces, holy objects, etc) may have belonged to  tribes other than those from whose reservation they were ultimately  unearthed.  It made for a VERY VERY long and complicated plan and  consultation process....not only when objects were unearthed, but simply  putting the required anticipatory plan and procedures in place PRIOR to  construction.  (It gives me a chuckle: my late husband, Leonard Hilton, who  was in charge of the TW project, is likely rolling in his own grave at the  mere thought of Enron having to put another of these plans  together..Haha!!)   As I said, I\\'ve not read the amendment , but hopefully it  only legally requires \\'notice\\'---yet, in my nearly 20 years of practicing  law, I\\'ve rarely seen  a \\'notice\\' that didn\\'t crack the door or sound the  alarm of further buerocratic opportunity!  For your further information, I have met Billie Ray Cypress personally and  he\\'s a decent and seemingly reasonable guy with a huge casino on the rez ;  yet these personal attributes frequently go by the wayside when it comes to  \\'perceived economic opportunity\\'.    Chief James Billie,[chief of the Seminoles, 2nd largest/2nd wealthiest tribe  in North America] on the other hand, is shrewd in business, dictitorial in  management, and personally , has an ego bigger than Texas, behavior to match,  and is proud of it!! --which makes him a ton of fun to be with if he likes  you--he wrestles alligators, writes rock and roll and \"plays\"in whatever  stage opportunity is presented him--as long as he can be the center of  attention.  The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site, James Billie has  his own!!  Check it out--it\\'s a hoot!!  He has been chief for about 25 years  (and I\\'m guessing he\\'s maybe in his early 50\\'s).  The Seminoles have  recognized significant economic development under James, but he is definitely  a \"My way or the highway\" kind of guy--he loves you, hates you, or ignores  you--and he has a tribal council that is respectfully terrified of him. If  any activity smacks of anything James Billie doesn\\'t like, he\\'ll know no  limits in stopping it...remember, this guy wrestles alligators!! No Joke!  I don\\'t recognize the other names on the list, but I think it\\'s clear from  both the beurocratic issues, as well as the specific tribal issues incident  to each affected tribe, everything associated with the process should be  executed with all of this in mind.  I\\'d be happy to speak with the project\\'s  lawyer to discuss this further, if information beyond that set forth above  would be helpful.

Jim Steffes is the EPSA witness on reliability and other issues at a Barton subcommittee hearing next Wed., Oct. 10th.  While the written testimony filed for the Sept. 11 hearing that was canceled is still operative, Jim's oral remarks can be whatever he wishes.  Also, even if he does not raise it in his opening statement, the issue will no doubt come up by others or in Q&A.  Thus -- any talking points need to be ready by Tuesday for this hearing.  Does not have to be anything fancy or hand-out quality.  Just something for Jim to consider using.  Charles, I do not recall any specific articles on what NERC said, but Sarah Novosel said she would check since she thought there was something like what you raised in your voice mail.\"]\n",

I would suggest Jean Ryall - who heads our Texas  government/regulatory affairs team.  She is certainly more familiar with the  details (of which there will be many more after this legislative session and  the conclusion of the pilot program).  She is also a very good speaker (and  can probably relate a few war stories to spice things up).   From: Susan Skarness/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/04/2001 11:20 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron   Subject: Beta Gamma Sigma  Steve,  I am a member of Beta Gamma Sigma (BGS), the honor society for business  programs accredited by AASCB - The International Association for Management  Education.  If you are not familiar with BGS, a member must be in the upper  5% of their class as a junior and the upper 10% as a senior and in graduate  school to be nominated for induction into the society.  In an effort to provide additional programs and benefits to alumni members,  alumni chapters are being developed around the country.  There are currently  nine alumni chapters around the U.S. with a new one being formed in the  Houston area.  I am serving on a steering committee for the development of  this Houston Area Alumni Chapter.  Our primary reasons for starting a Houston  Area Chapter include networking, professional affiliations, outreach to  students, resources, learning opportunities, and providing scholarships.  Our initial outreach to Beta Gamma Sigma members will be through a  reception/dinner to be held in October 2001.  We are currently looking at  either October 16 or 18.  All 6,200 Houston area members will be invited to  participate, however, we expect attendance to be closer to 75-100 people.   The ages, experiences, and business affiliation of the members will be very  diverse, but all will have the common thread of business excellence.  The details of this event are still being finalized; however, at our last  meeting the discussion encompassed possible speakers and topics.   Overwhelmingly the team decided on Electricity Deregulation in Texas, and  since I work at Enron, I was asked to assist in locating a dynamic speaker.   Cliff Baxter suggested that you would be an ideal speaker on this topic.  Are  you available and willing to address this group in October?    If I can provide any additional information, please let me know.  Thank you for your consideration, Steve.    ']\n",

House  hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate  hearing was on last week\\'s FERC order on a \"soft price cap\" and related  issues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal  Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation  Implementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the  Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the  three FERC commissioners.  HIghlights  Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton  bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will  happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will  report back with more information and conclusions once that is done);  Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week. There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that  higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate  increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation  costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at  the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical  conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as  it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country  attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants. The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses,  attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism  was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high  price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell  it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus  sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their  strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA  testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region  to support sec. 102. Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a  price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among  the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could  be done; the witnesses just said \"cost plus a reasonable profit\" and said  leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had  the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would  take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last  week\\'s soft price cap is much better. Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to  admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT  have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken  recently.  The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it  was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when  Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that \"help is on the way\" in the form  of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that  suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern  came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat  contentious at times.  Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details.']\n",

Doug Schuler <schuler@rice.edu> on 05/01/2001 10:59:10 AM To: skean@enron.com cc:    Subject: my work situation  Dear Steve, Jim, and Rick: I just wanted to give you a quick update on my situation at Rice and to inquire as to a future project with your group at Enron.  First, I apologize for my prolonged recent absences. I have had two long-standing academic projects: one was due 4/19 (it was on \"final review\" - a paper about corporate political strategy - and just was accepted for publication at our top academic journal) and another is due 5/31. The 5/31 paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference (topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the public affairs function). In order to get it done properly, I need to forego any work at Enron until later in the month.  A project of interest to me at Enron - and I hope one that you also have interest - is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs. John told me that he conducted such a study for the group last year. One of the methodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that government affairs brings - especially in a system where, for example, on the legislative side, much of the \"work\" of government affairs is to block legislation at very early stages. I suspect that govt. affairs needs to justify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefits of the function are important to quantify. I\\'d like to review any of the previous work and make suggestions as necessary.  At some point, let me know how you would like to proceed.  Otherwise, I hope all is well with you all.

It  states that rich countries on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have  stagering entry costs caused by corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays.  These \"entry hurdles\"  and asscoiated costs do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the  environment.  We might want to make the analogy of \"entry tax\" for new deregulated gas &  power markets.  Things like negotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow  the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition. Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what  they are going to get) and clearly slows the new comers down.  I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece.  John   ']\n",

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up  on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned  power plants).  Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star  witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and  Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their  message was simple (and simplistic):  El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas  at the border (to \"obscene\" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.  Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide  the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets  any questions on the topic.  It\\'s attached.  Apologies, it\\'s quick and dirty,  but it provides the basics.  Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to  offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California  Legislature is peddling.  Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the  California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis  when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of  the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

As I read it, we still have the problems with the EEI draft that we had with the NERC draft on which it is based -- deference, regional rules variances, regional reliability entities, regional advisory boards, limits on FERC authority, etc., etc.  It would also be helpful to have input on whether the plans for EISB could go forward if legislation like the EEI bill were enacted into law.

Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff.  Mark did the talking.  The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can\\'t agree on reliability legislation.  EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday\\'s meeting.  EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own.  I need to read the 9/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern.  EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC \"consensus\"), but I think EPSA staff may be \"too flexible\" in how they are approaching it.  I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim\\'s prepared statement on EPSA\\'s behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing.  EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project.  It is not clear if this effort will succeed.  EPSA staff said EEI\\'s board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA.  EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can.

We anticipate that we will use gas, but in  either case, we will not pass the emmissions threshold. Obviously diesel will provide less generation.   Enron currently has a gas  compressor on site and we own the land.   We are seeking to deliver the power to markets in the west. This will serve  the Palo Verde region.  Jim Steffes has been advising as to the local permitting processes.  I will keep you in the loop as we proceed.  We will probably look to permit  other such generation facilities in the west.']\n",

He is  offering to get us access to Andrew Lundquist (I said staffer preciously, but  we now know he is Chairman of the President\\'s Energy Task force). He also  thinks he can get us in to top levels of the Energy Department, and the White  House (we think he is talking about Carl Rove - who was G.W.\\'s Campaign  Manager and is now a senior White House Counsel). For this service, he wants $10,000 plus direct expenses. If unsuccessful in  at least getting us into Lundquist, he will not charge anything. We think  it\\'s a worthwhile shot.

The meeting will take place at:  The Omni Interlocken 500 Interlocken Blvd. Broomfield, Colorado  80021 Phone# 303-438-6600 Fax# 303-464-3252 Check-in time  3:00 p.m. Check-out time  12:00 p.m. (Noon)  The  Government Affairs meeting will take place on Thursday, June 14 and will  begin at 8:00 am and will conclude by 11:30 am.  I have arranged for box  lunches to be served after the meeting.   After the meeting, we will have the  remainder of the day for some fun activities, along with a buffet dinner  served that evening to complete the day (on-site dinner location TBD).    Block of Rooms - A block of rooms have been reserved for Government Affairs.   I will be turning in a rooming list to the hotel next week so, I  would like  to know by Friday, April 27 your plans to attend the meeting.     Shuttle Service -  See attachment for shuttle times.  Please note, a return  reservation from the hotel to the airport is required.  Please contact the  Concierge to arrange for shuttle service.  Colorado Weather - For the month of June, you can expect the  following:          High\\'s - 80.............Low\\'s - 52  Flights from Houston - I have checked with TAP for roundtrip flights from  Houston - Denver, Denver - Houston and an exceptionally great  (non-refundable) fare of $190.94 is available.  However, fares are not  guaranteed until actually booked.   Let\\'s book early!!!!!  The activities to choose from are as follows:  Please let me know by May 4  your choice of activity!!!!!!  Whitewater Rafting - A bus will leave the Omni Interlocken Resort at 2:00pm  to head for an afternoon of exciting adventure on Colorado\\'s Clear Creek.   The Arkansas River is one of the most popular whitewater adventures anywhere,  combining spectacular scenery and action packed rapids.  Teamwork is the name  of the game as your team paddles down these tumbling cascades.  Continuous  class III and IV rapids will thrill guests throughout the run. Drop over  Nomad, surge through the Phoenix Holes and take on the class IV climax, the  Outer Limits.  Good physical condition and the ability to swim are  recommended.  The group will have three thrilling hours on the river and will  return to the Omni by 6:15pm.  Chautauqua Park Hiking Adventure - One of the most popular access points for  mountain hiking trails in Boulder is Chautauqua Park. The focal point is the  100-year-old dining hall.  The Colorado Chautauqua is one of only four of the  original Chautauquas still operating in America, as opposed to when thousands  dotted the nation and culturally enriched rural people in the early 1900s.  The tour includes: transportation, professional guide service, two hours of  guided hiking - total time for excursion is 4 hours. (Dress code: Shorts or  hiking attire, appropriate footwear, sunglasses, sunscreen and hats).   Departure time and return will be relayed at a later date.  Spa Services -  The Spa at Omni Interlocken Resort offers a number of spa  services (massages, facial & skin care treatments, body treatments or nail  services, to name a few).  If you are interested in this as an activity,  please let me know and I will fax a detailed list of their services.  You  will need to call the spa and schedule your own appointment if this is the  activity you choose.  Golf -  For the golf enthusiasts, an afternoon of golf at the Omni  Interlocken 27-hole championship golf course which stretches out over 300  acres of verdant fairways is another activity to select from.  Spectacular  panoramic views from three 9-hole courses, which feature more than 400 feet  in elevation changes.  If this is the activity of choice please respond via  e:mail and I will add you to the list.  The game of choice will be \"best  ball\" play.  Biking -  Scenic bike paths are located near the hotel for those with  interest.  If this is your choice of activity, please let me know and I will  reserve a bike and map for you enjoyment.  After reviewing the choices above, please select an activity you prefer to  take part in.  Due to the fact that our group is so large, (which makes it  more difficult to coordinate activities) once you select an activity, we ask  that you not change your selection.  So, please talk to your colleagues ahead  of time before making your choice.  Thanks and don\\'t hesitate to call me if you have any questions.

All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation,  will be required to sell into the ISO\\'s real time market as a condition of  their use of the ISO\\'s interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric  facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr)   Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price  auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the  ISO\\'s real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a  participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power  and bid its marginal cost based on the generator\\'s heat curve, emission  rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be  the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California;  emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and  emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.  A  single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.   Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with  FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each  generating unit.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost  for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event  a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must,  within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO  justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs  in real time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to  justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with  no opportunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.  Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities  must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be  curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.   (24-7)    Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced  outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC.   Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.  RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1  or Order lapses with no further effect.  ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how  things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due  in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.  Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate  authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold  of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate bidding  behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the  generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit  behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be  inappropriate.  In addition, \"hockey stick\" bids are expressly prohibited  (i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).  Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.   Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a  control area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when  this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be  justified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell  contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within  WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.   Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective  date is 60 days from publication of the Order.  Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is  prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines  does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part  of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation  would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.    Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether  FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow  account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the  PG&E bankruptcy filing.    No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from  California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of  the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will  keep you posted.  RA ']\n",

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up  on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned  power plants).  Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star  witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and  Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their  message was simple (and simplistic):  El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas  at the border (to \"obscene\" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.  Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide  the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets  any questions on the topic.  It\\'s attached.  Apologies, it\\'s quick and dirty,  but it provides the basics.  Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to  offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California  Legislature is peddling.  Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the  California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis  when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of  the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.  Best, Jeff   ']\n",

The current challenges are keeping company's management busy. Being aware of this I wanted to take liberty of asking, if it would be possible to get someone of Enron's top executive to contribute Nokia's top executive development program. We have invited a few external key note speakers to elaborate their company's transformation. This kind of experience change has proved to be beneficial for both parties. Also Nokia's experiences have been valuable input in certain restructuring processes.  This program, called Panorama, is an annual top executive development program, which takes about half a year in three modules. In every year we have nominated 35 participants to this intensive action. The program target is three folded, give input to company's strategy development, strengthen and integrate common understanding of company's direction, and develop leadership capacity. The program owner is Jorma Ollila, CEO of Nokia.  What are benefits from Enron's point of view in the case we are able to get someone of Enron's executives in the program? I think that one of the most important outcome of this kind of events is  to open a dynamic networking and discussion forum between our executives. Both parties could capitalize this cooperation.  In short, we would appreciate very much if we could have your company's presentation in this Panorama forum.  Looking forward to hearing from you,  Yours sincerely,  Juhani Hokkanen, Senior Vice President, Human Resources Development Nokia Group  Tel. (858)831-4877 Mobile (972) 467-1453 \"]\n",

Similar letters were delivered by  Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron\\'s offices in the UK,  Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium.  I have attached a copy of one of the letters below.  All the questions are  the same in each.  I have drafted a response with the goals of:  1)  Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without  \"greenwashing.\"   We have an already-published public \"statement\" on climate  change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts  and accomplishments to back up our statements.   I think our letter can land  in the stack that they consider \"positive\" responses, and not in the stack of  non-responses or \"we don\\'t care\" responses.  2)  Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about \"Kyoto.\"    I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful  answers to the general themes of the letter.   I have discussed this with  many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down  into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto....we\\'ll  quickly get into questions we can\\'t now answer, and may never be able to  answer.   I\\'d prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look  solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be  engaged in this important issue.  3)  Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple  applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script  to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual  meeting Q&A;  Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations;  something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report.    Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive  issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we  need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can  understand and use.  With that said, I also believe that these messages  should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying  too far from the basics can be dangerous.  We should designate one or two  clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by  press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what\\'s in our  response letter.  There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices,  using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds  in the local areas.   I am not opposed to doing so, but would again  appreciate being able to review these responses before they go.  Please let  me know if you have other views.  I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23  if we can turn it around that fast.  Thank you for your input and assistance  and I look forward to your reply.

By Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writer (Published April 20, 2001)=20 Adding to the risk of summertime blackouts, the state water department said= =20 Thursday it might not pay \"ridiculous\" prices for electricity even if that= =20 leaves California short of power.=20 The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for th= e=20 state\\'s two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn\\'t spell out wha= t=20 it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be=20 better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation=20 programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the= =20 department\\'s deputy director in charge of power purchases.=20 Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep th= e=20 lights on. When you\\'re fighting a forest fire, you don\\'t say, \\'Let me see,= =20 how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can\\'t write the check, maybe I= =20 can\\'t put the fire out.\\' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost= =20 later.\"=20 But Davis\\' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor\\'s Office indeed is= =20 contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point do= es=20 the state say, \\'Enough is enough\\'? Those scenarios are certainly under=20 discussion,\" Maviglio said.=20 The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern= =20 California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to=20 purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it\\'s had to relax tha= t=20 stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Har= t=20 said.=20 That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell=20 electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System=20 Operator, which manages the state\\'s power grid. Because the ISO -- which ge= ts=20 its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water=20 department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Har= t=20 said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand.= =20 \"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there\\'s a policy call to be= =20 made, and we\\'ll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said.=20 The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling= =20 blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy= =20 ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid.=20 \"On a daily basis we\\'re dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick= =20 Dorinson. \"It sounds like ... we\\'re going to be handed another set of cards= ,=20 and we\\'re going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as= =20 best we can.\"=20 Hart\\'s comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis an= d=20 PG&E over the water department\\'s power expenditures. State spending shot up= =20 following PG&E\\'s April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection.=20 Davis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water=20 department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the=20 state\\'s daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million i= n=20 the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor\\'s office said.=20 Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time=20 there\\'s a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged= =20 alert by the ISO, there\\'s a price run-up,\" Hart said.=20 But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt ho= ur=20 April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below= =20 what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax new= s=20 service.=20 PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state\\'= s=20 increased spending.=20 \"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporter= s.=20 Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water=20 department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC orde= r,=20 PG&E said.=20 Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department cou= ld=20 further strain the state\\'s budget -- and complicate Davis\\' plan to finance= =20 the power purchases through a bond offering.=20 The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power=20 purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E\\'s=20 bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third= =20 Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings= =20 watch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded.=20 A downgrade could raise California\\'s borrowing costs. All three of the=20 leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch.= =20 Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an=20 investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy= =20 providers haven\\'t resumed production even though they\\'ve begun receiving=20 payments again from Edison and PG&E.=20 These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20=20 percent of the state\\'s energy supply.

By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published April 20, 2001)=20 Ten years of stable electricity bills vanished in a single unanimous vote= =20 Thursday night as directors of Sacramento Municipal Utility District gave= =20 tentative approval to rate hikes ranging from 19 percent to 27 percent.=20 The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled= =20 for May 3.=20 \"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praisi= ng=20 the value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything= =20 from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice.=20 SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as=20 deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that= =20 helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings.=20 The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD\\'s cogeneration plants, has risen= =20 steeply.=20 Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its= =20 own plants, nearly tripled between October and January.=20 And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD\\'s=20 hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of=20 normal to date.=20 But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the=20 board to reconsider.=20 \"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage a= ll=20 at once,\" said Marian Ender.=20 Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before= =20 had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manag= er=20 at Intel who served on SMUD\\'s advisory rate committee.=20 The increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he= =20 understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more=20 electricity available in the future.=20 \"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu= =20 said.=20 Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124=20 million annually for SMUD, and a special=20 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of= =20 the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent= =20 years, will go into an emergency fund.=20 \"We have to build back our savings account. It\\'s been gutted,\" said directo= r=20 Susan Patterson.=20 The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large=20 industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills= =20 will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee.=20 The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential= =20 SMUD bill of $67, but it\\'s a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly= =20 bill hovers around $20.=20 \"I just don\\'t think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay fo= r=20 usage.\"=20 Tom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that= =20 charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to=20 serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more.=20 But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run=20 farmers\\' wells and irrigation systems.=20 \"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby=20 agriculture,\" Keat said.=20 The new rates will apply throughout SMUD\\'s service territory, which include= s=20 a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip o= f=20 Sacramento County.

A PUC decision is expected next month.=20 Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industrie= s=20 will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultura= l=20 rates will rise 22 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residenti= al=20 rates 19 percent.=20 Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will p= ay=20 a smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the=20 surcharge on their baseline electricity usage.=20 Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD a= t=20 (888) 742-7683.=20  The Bee\\'s Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or=20 cpeyton@sacbee.com.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------- Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woes By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau (Published April 20, 2001)=20 On a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidenti= al=20 candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California= =20 from its deepening energy troubles.=20 After attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov.= =20 Gray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the= =20 federal government\\'s role in easing California\\'s electricity woes.=20 Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned th= at=20 if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of= =20 the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects.=20 \"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects= =20 our largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the=20 Democratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ...

Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis=20 because most of the state\\'s generating plants run on natural gas.=20 Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark=20 price paid at California\\'s border has been double that paid at other bench= =20 mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures=20 released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight.=20 Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on= =20 behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities=20 Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene.=20 The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart= =20 deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the siste= r=20 companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural ga= s=20 that flows into Southern California from Texas.=20 El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New=20 Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an=20 unregulated sister company.=20 Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California \"simply=20 unprecedented\" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies= =20 manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million Britis= h=20 thermal units of gas.=20 In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power= =20 plants, \"qualifying facilities\" that get paid based on the price of natural= =20 gas in California.

Darrell E.

Since January, the state government has been=20 buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put=20 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dolla= rs=20 into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since= =20 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ?????Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strong= ly=20 opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California=20 Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the=20 administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They=20 brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their=20 ideological belief in a free market. ?????\"This is not a free-enterprise situation,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpin= e)=20 said after the meeting. \"In fact, it\\'s just the opposite.\" ?????Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices=20 charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said=20 California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs.= =20 Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it fin= ds=20 they are exerting \"market power\" to drive prices to unreasonable levels. ?????Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators i= n=20 Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in=20 California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical=20 pipeline into the state. ?????After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman= =20 (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats= =20 and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in th= e=20 ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There= =20 has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has n= o=20 political motive to help the state. ?????\"We Democrats,\" said Sherman, \"hope very much that our skepticism is= =20 proven wrong.\" ?????Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen.

A rejection of the= =20 deal \"would be a humiliating setback for the governor,\" S&P said. ?????The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison\\'s=20 transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion= =20 in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility\\'s huge electricity debt.=20 Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to= =20 the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power. ?????Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators= =20 have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a=20 desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicl= y=20 that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not= =20 be such a dire outcome. ?????But a senior Edison executive said it is \"way too early\" to give up on= =20 passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official fo= rm. ?????\"There is an education process to do here,\" the executive said of the= =20 highly detailed 38-page document. \"The legislators should be asking=20 questions. That is appropriate.\" ?????* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether=20 alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding= =20 supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dolla= rs. ?????The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by=20 lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts wit= h=20 the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal=20 energy account for more than 25% of California\\'s electricity supply. ?????\"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long,= =20 hot days of summer,\" Wood said. ?????Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC=20 needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. \"All we have gott= en=20 is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,\" he said. ?????* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious=20 megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by= =20 state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June. ?????Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking= =20 $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to=20 distribute to the state\\'s investor-owned utilities to support existing=20 conservation programs. ?????But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC\\'s Division of Strategic Planning= ,=20 said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy=20 protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds. ?????Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E\\'s=20 decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could=20 follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency= \\'s=20 efforts. ?????PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the= =20 Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and= =20 separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if th= e=20 court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expense= s=20 anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the= =20 view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for la= te=20 spring and early summer. ?????Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission sai= d=20 his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolste= r=20 their output during that period.

(AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  - Gov. Kenny Guinn signed a bill Wednesday that would stop the sale of Nevada power plants, halt deregulation and bail out struggling utilities with a new rate system.   The Senate and Assembly gave the measure final approval earlier in the day and rushed it to the governor. The bill was crafted to keep Nevada from suffering from a power crisis similar to California\\'s.   ``I must tell you this is a great relief,\\'\\' said Guinn, a former utility executive, as he signed the bill into law. ``Nothing can control escalating costs, but we\\'re in the best position to protect ourselves.\\'\\'   Legislators made a last-minute change to add language that ensured consumers would get a break on rates if utilities profit from sales of excess power to other states.   Guinn said the bill takes care of the most pressing energy issues, but other deregulation-related bills are sure to follow. That includes a plan that would allow major power users, such as casinos and mines, to buy power on the open market.   Legislators also are working on plans encouraging energy conservation and ensuring the poor can pay their utility bills. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -----   PG&E Co. Issues Statements On the Increase in the State\\'s Cost for Power    SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -  FROM:   John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and   Electric Company   There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effect Pacific Gas and Electric Company\\'s bankruptcy filing may have had on energy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few useful facts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may be driving the state\\'s energy costs higher.   Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was paying roughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct result of the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it\\'s understandable, even laudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsides of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governor should know better.   Consider the facts:   --  On January 19, the credit ratings of California\\'s two largest   investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to   below investment grade by every major rating agency.   Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to   sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.   --  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state   Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power   purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the   Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an   ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could   be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in   the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the   full \"net open position\", which is the amount of additional   generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or   have under contract, to meet customer demand.   However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of   state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full   net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was   only buying power that it considered \"reasonably priced\" and   was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the   lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to   20-percent of the state\\'s daily electricity need.   --  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass   along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market   purchases to the state\\'s non-creditworthy utilities (despite   existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).   PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly   $10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don\\'t know   for sure, because we haven\\'t seen the bill. The DWR won\\'t say   how much power it\\'s buying, and at what cost, and neither will   the ISO.)   --  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   informed the Independent System Operator that it could not   force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,   both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to   purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the   next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying   the order was limited to \"emergency\" power only. The ISO also   sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining   order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to   continue selling to it.   --  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with   FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO\\'s interpretation of the   February 14 order was contrary to FERC\\'s intent.   --  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge   Damrell\\'s lower court order affecting one of the generators,   Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell   electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.   Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they   sought such assurances.   --  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11   filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the   \"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy   procurement costs\" caused by the state\\'s failure to assume the   full procurement responsibility.   --  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E\\'s bankruptcy filing, FERC issued   an order responding to the generators\\' Feb. 22 complaint   against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its   February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf   of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.   --  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor\\'s   office acknowledged the State\\'s \"bill for energy purchases   will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling   last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\" once   DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than   force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely   that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the   utilities\\' costs, not the combination of both.   --  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of   publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.   --  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid   buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to   the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO   sent a \"murky\" notice to generators promising that \"any bid   accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial   support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this   notice.\" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the   assurances contained in the letter.   --  Yesterday, in response to the Governor\\'s claim that bankruptcy   was driving up the state\\'s costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for   the Western Power Trading Forum, said \"I don\\'t believe, nor   have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to   the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and   marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings   order to an otherwise volatile situation.\"   What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state\\'s costs have come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state\\'s energy needs, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR\\'s buying habits has come as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC orders that the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders were issued independent of PG&amp;E\\'s bankruptcy filing and apply equally to PG&amp;E and SCE.   Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January, when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, and the DWR, ISO and Governor\\'s office have been aware of the effect of the FERC order since mid-February.   Some generators have suggested that California has been paying a credit penalty since December, when the utilities\\' deteriorating financial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to be far more evidence that the state\\'s coy approach to AB1x implementation has created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E\\'s Chapter 11 filing.

Power and Associates Reports/ Nationwide Decline in Customer=20 Satisfaction of Electric Utility Service Among Midsize Businesses     Price and Value Performance Hit Hard Across Nation;   Satisfaction in California Continues to Plummet   AGOURA HILLS, Calif., April 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Midsize business customers, who are responsible for approximately fifteen percent of the nation\\'s electricity consumption, are very critical of electricity prices, according=  to the J.D. Power and Associates 2001 Electric Utility Midsize Business Custom= er Satisfaction Study(SM) released today.  Consequently, the study\\'s nationwid= e customer satisfaction index fell -- from 100 points in 2000 to 97 in 2001.   (Photo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-a   http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-b   http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-c   http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-d   http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-e )   \"The entire country was affected by higher natural gas prices this winter, and with more states re-evaluating deregulation, midsize business customers are especially sensitive to electricity prices,\" said Jeffrey Conklin, seni= or director at J.D. Power and Associates.   The 2001 study shows that average overall customer satisfaction with California\\'s \"big three\" investor-owned utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electr= ic, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison -- fell an astonishing 14 index points among midsize businesses compared to the 2000 study.   \"In California, electric utility satisfaction among midsize business customers has virtually fallen into the Pacific,\" said Alan Destribats, executive director of the utility practice at J.D. Power and Associates.   The study finds that the chief determinants of satisfaction among electric utility midsize customers are a provider\\'s company image, price and value, = and power quality and reliability.   As expected, midsize business customers were extremely critical of performance in the areas of company image and price and value.  Even outsid= e of California, satisfaction in the price and value component fell more than any other factor -- from an index score of 100 in 2000 to 93 in 2001.   Power Quality and Reliability   Utility performance in power quality and reliability is improving, with the national index increasing by 3 points.  Although the number of interruptions and outages experienced was relatively the same in 2001 as it was in 2000, midsize businesses report much shorter outage durations, falli= ng from an average of seven hours for the longest outages in 2000 to four hour= s in 2001.   Retail Competition   \"Opening utility markets to competition has proven to be a difficult process and, so far, midsize business customers are giving the industry poo= r marks,\" said Destribats.   The study shows that midsize business customers located in states with competition not only are less satisfied than are customers in other states, but they are also significantly less satisfied now than last year.  The stu= dy also shows that more midsize businesses have switched electricity providers= . Of midsize businesses eligible to switch power suppliers, 9 percent have do= ne so, up from 5 percent in 2000.   J.D. Power and Associates interviewed representatives from more than 7,200 midsize businesses, including manufacturers, retailers, business and consumer services firms, health care providers and other midsize businesses throughout the United States.  Midsize business owners are defined as those who normally spend $1,500 to $25,000 per month on electricity.  The study shows that midsize businesses are now spending an average of $4,827 per mon= th on electricity.   The study shows that utilities in the south region of the United States consistently receive higher ratings across all factors of customer satisfaction.  Likewise, these midsize business customers also report the lowest levels of monthly electricity expenditures, on average.  Midsize businesses in North Carolina spend the least for electric usage ($3,885 per month on average), while those in New Hampshire, Nevada and Utah spend the most ($5,700 to $5,800 per month on average).  The study also shows that midsize businesses in Alabama and Florida report the most service interruptions and outages within the past 12 months, and those in Washingto= n report the fewest.   East Region   PPL Utilities, serving east Pennsylvania, ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize businesses in the eastern United States. PPL Utilities ranked highest in the East Region in four of the six factors that comprise customer satisfaction, with its primary strength in price and value.  Other solid performers in this region include Public Service Electr= ic and Gas, Allegheny Power and GPU Energy.   Midwest Region   LG&amp;E Energy, the parent company of Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Ga= s and Electric, ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize business electric service in the Midwest.  LG&amp;E Energy midsize business customers give high ratings for power quality and reliability, customer service, and billing and payment.  Alliant Energy, AEP-Midwest and Xcel Energy-NSP also rank high in midsize business customer satisfaction in the Midwest Region.   South Region   Southern Company ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction for midsize business electric service in the South Region and received the high= est customer satisfaction index score among all utilities included in the study= . Southern Company dominates all other electric utility service providers, achieving the highest ratings in the nation in five of the six components (2 in a tie).  Other strong performers in the South Region include Duke Pow= er, Florida Power &amp; Light and Progress Energy (Carolina Power &amp; Light a= nd=20 Florida Power).   West Region   Sierra Pacific Resources ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize business electric service in the West Region.  This utility significantly leads the region by rating highest in all six components (1 i= n a tie).  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also ranks high in thi= s region.

The letter is attached way at the bottom of this  e-mail, and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what  was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies.  I have not  confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you, but am assuming it  was delivered.  I think we could respond in a very positive, constructive manner to  Greenpeace, based on the statements we\\'ve already documented and the  strategies we are developing.  Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on  developing some tighter climate change and clean air \"messages\" that we can  use in multiple areas ASAP -- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with  the Administration, revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate  Responsibility Report, Enron Business articles and other internal uses,  responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&A, and  use in everyday speeches and advocacy work.  The Greenpeace questions are tricky, and set up no-win answers for the most  part.  I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like:  \"Does  your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol?\"   In  my opinion, we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these  types of questions.  Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope -- its  best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we\\'ve always taken.  For this reason, I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a  characterization of Mark Palmer\\'s statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile  in London) -- \"Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was  not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.  However it is not the  principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle  that has been devised to deliver the results.\"  I believe it is dangerous to  make such statements for a number of reasons -- Greenpeace would absolutely  beat us over the head with it, Friends of the Earth could step up its  shareholder initiatives, etc.    Also, this sets you up for a number of  follow up questions that I don\\'t think we have answers to, like:  What about  Kyoto is not workable?  What would make it workable and would we help make it  workable?  If not Kyoto, what is Enron\\'s preferred \"vehicle?\"  I\\'d really  rather stay with a constructive, solution-oriented approach and avoid  reference to Kyoto altogether.  I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this, but I think we need  to decide on a global, corporate-wide response to Greenpeace.   I would be  happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject, or just field  comments by e-mail -- whatever works best.  Thoughts?

Several of our offices (Spain, Belgium, Netherlands) have received a local language version of the letter originally sent to Jeff Skilling, and other CEOs, on 5 April 2001. The email chain below gives an indication of what is in circulation.  Greenpeace is expecting a response within the next week. Jackie Gentle has made me the point of contact in the PR department for this issue. We have discussed this issue briefly and we would support issuing an initial statement to acknowledge receipt of the letters, perhaps followed by a standardised, corporate- approved letter, but would like to ensure our approach is supported, and consistent with any actions, by Corporate. As some of the countries in which we operate have tangible \"green\" focused projects e.g. we have acquired a wind project in The Netherlands, it may be appropriate to allow such countries to personalise their response in local language.  If we follow up an initial acknowledgement with a fuller response to Greenpeace\\'s questions, I suggest we consider the following issues raised recently by Jackie Gentle:  \"In response to several requests for clarification, I have spoken with Mark Palmer who has provided the following information on Enron\\'s stance regarding Kyoto:  Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.  However it is not the principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results.  We firmly believe that there is work to be done in reducing greenhouse gases and Enron has put in place a number of programs that have measurably reduced carbon dioxide as well as SO2 and Oxides of Nitrogen (Nox)  By way of example ....    emissions trading programs have been put in place where these can be    implemented    Enron is one of the largest developers of natural gas-fired power plants    which produce about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than coal or    oil-fired plants    demand-side management programs through EES to reduce energy usage    the Catalytica program    focus on renewable-related projects  At the current time there is no formal statement from Enron Corp on the Kyoto issue.\"  Before we proceed, I would be grateful if you could contact me to share your views on this.

Your communications are always complete,  firm, clear and polite.  I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of  your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end.  I understand  from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you  from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway.  I have asked John to  lead the effort, to the extent you need him.  John and his team are very  experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London  office.  Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked  him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the  area in question.  It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of  Enron\\'s corporate security needs.  A little background I\\'ll bore you with:   after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not  replace his function.  Most of the operating companies had their own security  and business controls groups.  When Andre left, we reduced the corporate  function to a \"default provider\" role -- if a business unit had a need it was  not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm)  would help identify competent resources in the area.  With the reorganization  of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had  assembled (led by John Brindle).  John identified some concerns regarding  India mid last week.  I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did.  It  was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already  addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work  involved implementation.  John volunteered to send some people over to help  and I said OK.  He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike  Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston).  The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying  \"we\\'re from corporate and we\\'re here to help\".  If you don\\'t need any \"help\"  or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better, let me  know.    To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Rebecca McDonald/Enron@EnronXGate, James A Hughes/Enron@EnronXGate   Subject: India Help  Steve,  As you are well aware, we are facing a lot of things happening fast in India.  We are using several parts of your team, and are very pleased with most. I  want to mention a couple of areas, HR and Security.  1. HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the  quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an  outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we  had a major issue on our hand, and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim  to bring some HR folks into the loop, HR had someone on a plane within 20  hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew  Lynch and Bob Sparger, helping our team led by Sandip Malik, and this time  Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have  been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over, and he and  Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared  now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR,  and Drew had his team there for us.  2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman, working with and  supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground. Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team  on the ground, and John has provided leadership and all coordination with  Houston. Great efforts and productive work.  3. Security: This area has not worked as well, and if you ever want feedback  on our one-time experience with this group, I will provide it. I don\\'t have  any idea who is in charge from Enron\\'s perspective here. There are 2 groups  headed this way. Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night, and Mike has informed  us that he will be leading all security efforts. Jim Rountree is apparently  travelling with Mike, and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling  me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our  security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him  to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts, and John is sending 3 people  over arriving Saturday night. First, we are very happy to have the help, but  I just hope that Mike, Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If  you could just let me know who you want to be in charge, we will coordinate  with that person.  On a side note, the people who have really been helpful were brought in  through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler, both of  whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude, were willing to work  day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he  would come.  At Mike\\'s earlier suggestion, we engaged Hill & Associates to help on  security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day, I  asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done  a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been  overseeing include coordinating with Hill & Associates, removing (in a lowkey  yet rush manner) over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them  through customs and to Europe, removing 2 container truck loads of files from  the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country, and overseeing a  complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from  servers, desktops and laptops. In addition, she has coordinated security for  all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony  Duenner of EBS Asia.  Again, we appreciate all the help.   Wade ']\n",

The numbers are  for Enron's domestic workforce only.  The bottom line is that the EBS and EES  redeployment figures are not unusual for Enron:  We moved over 3000 employees  last year (about 25% of our domestic workforce).  Most of these moves are  attributable new business startups (eg EGM, ENW and EIM) and normal course of  business transfers within the company.  The formal redeployment process makes  up only a small fraction of the total moves in the company.    ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 04/10/2001  02:49 PM --------------------------- From: Suzanne Brown/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/10/2001 12:51 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject:    \\t   \"]\n",

Mr. Kean\\'s responsibilities include government affairs, public relations, corporate communications, advertising, and administration.  Mr. Kean also serves on the Executive Committee of Enron.

Transmission Sale =01) SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets=  for=20 approximately $2.76 billion (2.3 times the net book value of the assets),= =20 subject to certain adjustments. Of the $2.76 billion, the $1.5 billion gain= =20 on sale, will be used to reduce SCE=01,s net undercollected amount as of Ja= nuary=20 31, 2001. In connection with the purchase, the State will also assume certa= in=20 liabilities associated with the transmission assets. ? Backup Transaction =01) If the transmission sale does not occur within tw= o=20 years for reasons beyond the parties=01, control, then if the State elects,=  SCE=20 shall sell to the State SCE=01,s hydro generation assets. If the hydro asse= ts=20 are not worth $1.5 billion, then SCE will also sell the state after Decembe= r=20 31, 2010 enough below-market-price-power to make up the shortfall. ?

Especially  if they already have a laptop (provided by Enron)  they take home every night  and have taken advantage of the Click at Home program as well.  Since Enron  has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the  opportunity of the Click at Home program, it seems to be a somewhat redundant  expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion.  I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES, including executives, to be more  conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enron\\'s and EBS\\' bottom-line.   How can we (\"Enron\") be a world leading company if we don\\'t have leading  world leaders that spend Enron\\'s money as if it were there own.  I think it would be in Enron\\'s best interest to set some guidelines regarding  expenses such as these.  Just because a person is an executive of the company  why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can?  Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself.

For the record, I have said early and often, that the inter-agency disputes among the financial regulatory agencies (which the Administration of George H.W. Bush inherited and did not create, by the way), are unacceptable and must be avoided.  The Dems, of course, love to get this sort of thing going, as it enables them to hold hearings on the need for further legislation to re-regulate. The fact that this President's father came to the White House in the denouement of a multi-billion dollar savings and loan crisis which he did not create is also usually forgotten.  As I said in my voicemail and as the attached article confirms, I think there is no substance to the rumor that Sen. Gramm would be opposed to my nomination.  As one of the few who contributed generously to his own Presidential Exploratory Committee in 1995-6, I think I stand in pretty well with the Senator and we would work well together.  After our last meeting, I think he would feel the same way.   > -----Original Message----- > From: Jordan, Jon > Sent: Monday, March 12, 2001 1:13 PM > To: Doty, James > Subject: Financial Times article > > Jim: > > As you may already have read, below is an article that was published in > the Financial Times today mentioning your prospects. > > http://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT3JC7587KC&l > ive=true&useoverridetemplate=IXLZHNNP94C > > I have heard that internally, the Staff is all pushing for you. > > > Jon B.

I am faxing to you a bootleg copy of the draft talking points Ed received  this morning at the White House energy \"messaging\" meeting.  These are very  close hold.   Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone.  Ed asked us to  give him feedback of any concerns we have with the talking points (he will be  giving them comments).  After glancing at the TPs, the obvious missing point  is open access.  However, I am not sure we should be alarmed about that.   There really isn\\'t any policy in the TPs.  This is a typical WH message  document.   Let me know if you think it is imperative to insert open access.   Also, Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House  outreach effort.  Any thoughts?   2.  I am faxing to you EPSA\\'s summary of the generators meeting with  Secretary Abraham.  I am glad I did not attend this meeting.  As you will see  from the summary, there were three parts to the meeting:  a) an exchange of  policy views, both long and short term, b) discussion of how to maximize  generator output in Calif; and c) a request that industry participate in a  DOE reliability group.  I don\\'t see any follow up for Enron, outside of our  normal course of activities and independent interchange with DOE officials.   Let me know if you have additional thoughts.     ']\n",

From your message I think there  may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us.  We understood that  your PR people wanted to reprint the Op-ed and redistribute it to  as-yet-undetermined people, along with various Enron material.  They also  wanted to post it on Enron\\'s public web site. But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the op-ed on your  intranet -  for educational use only for your internal folks.  If this is  correct, we would have no problem with it. In fact, we have posted the op-ed  on the CERA web page - which is theoretically available to every Enron  employee for internal use only.  If you want you could just post a link to  the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research  on the topic. If I misunderstood you, and you do want to redistribute the piece to  third-parties -- that is a much bigger issue because it involves our  intellectual property and  branding issues.  Obviously, we would need to talk  some more about this.  I hope this helps. On a somewhat-related note, we are also getting sucked more and more into the  California vortex, and being asked to help in areas that are not our  traditional business, such as expert witness testimony and policy issues.   While we are not afraid to take a point of view (as you know!) we must  maintain a neutral and independent posture.  This is sometimes a difficult  path to navigate, but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron: 1. We have examined Joskow and FERC\\'s analysis on the price gouging issue and  we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies.  We are  considering how best to broadcast our assessment, without impinging on our  core business, or becoming an expert witness.  We think a workshop, similar  to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work, where we would present our  findings and issue a report. 2. We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West  - especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy.  This  would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or  university.  Again the reults would go to our clients, but could be released  to a wider audience, and a workshop might help highlight the release. Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron.  We would  need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort ,  but the work would be CERA\\'s independent research and we would stand fully  behind it. Hope all is well. ...Peter  .  ']\n",

X-Origin: Shapiro-R X-FileName: RSHAPIRO (Non-Privileged).pst   I have read through the 19 pages of Administration comments on the Bingaman draft electricity bill released last month.  Here are the main items in a quick bullet format so you have the flavor of them.  Delete provision on federal jurisdiction over bundled/unbundled (they don\\'t offer a reason).  We of course agree for tactical reasons.  Add a provision to authorize FERC to order wheeling in States that open retail markets.  Add a provision to allow FERC to issue wheeling orders on its own motion based on an informal hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing as under current law.  Make it clear that the Federal Power Act does not affect the authority of a State to require retail competition (the comments say some utilities have tried to argue that the FPA prohibits states).  The provision giving FERC power to order RTO participation should be deleted.  The comments raise drafting question.  The changes to the FERC merger review sections of the FPA should be limited.  \"FERC lite\" should be extended only to state municipal utilities and cooperatives, not the Federal utilities.  The FERC should authority over the Federal transmission systems equivalent to FERC authority over public utilities (with special BPA rules).  No need to legislate on market-based rates (we oppose the Bingaman language anyway, so this is helpful).  Interconnection language should be limited to transmission facilities, not local distribution.  No objection to streamlined reliability provision (this is good for us).  Remedial measures for market power should be deleted.  Administration to provide legislative language on federal transmission siting provisions, which they want to retain.  Not convinced there is a need for market transparency rules because FERC and DOE already have enough authority.  Administration supports even tougher criminal penalties.  Recordkeeping under PUHCA repeal should be clarified.  Federal purchase requirement for renewable energy should be deleted.  No objection to real-time pricing standard.  Net metering should be limited to small residential renewable facilities.  Do not support federal renewable portfolio standard (but could clarify state authority to adopt same).']\n",

Mike  -----Original Message----- From: David Cook [mailto:dcook@nerc.com] Sent: Saturday, March 24, 2001 4:19 PM To: dcook@nerc.com Subject: Compliance Agreement   Regional Managers Compliance Task Force  As we discussed on the conference call on Friday, I have prepared a simple draft letter of intent for the use of those regions who wish to indicate support for the regional compliance and enforcement program, but are not yet in a position to sign the Agreement for Regional Compliance and Enforcement Programs that the NERC Board of Trustees approved on February 13.  For the benefit of those who were not on the call, I\\'d like to recap where things stand at this point.  My apologies if I mischaracterize anyone\\'s position.  NPCC and ERCOT have signed the agreement.  ECAR has stated it will sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on March 30.  SPP is prepared to sign the agreement, but doesn\\'t want to be the only one it its part of the Eastern Interconnection to do so.  FRCC was not on the call, but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at least six regions sign.  MAPP and MAIN have indicated that they prefer to develop their program with their own members before they sign the NERC agreement.  WSCC may need to consider the matter at its Board meeting in early April.  SERC has the matter under consideration.  I have not heard from MAAC, but it has a meeting scheduling for March 29.  I want to share with you my concern for the climate in Washington.  In the past few weeks I have had occasion to speak with a number of people on Capitol Hill and in the new Administration.  All are very concerned about what might happen this summer.  If a serious incident occurs, I am quite sure that Congress will legislate very quickly--whether it will legislate wisely is a different question.  We have the opportunity with this agreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny.  If Congress acts it may well assign a very central role to the Federal government to take direct responsibility for reliability.  There are those in the Department of Energy who are pushing for such a role.   Congressman Barton is talking of the possibility of emergency legislation, possibly within the next few weeks.  If the industry pulls together, I believe we can forestall direct governmental controls, just as in 1965.  If the industry does not step up, then Congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere.  The CTG recommended to the Board that a critical mass of six Regions sign onto the agreement before it goes forward.  For those Regions that are considering developing their own programs with their members before they sign the agreement, with the view of having the CAPG determine in advance whether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement, I ask you to consider this:  If we don\\'t get a critical mass of Regions to sign, then the CAPG may not come into existence.  The NERC/Regions agreement is really an undertaking by the regions to work to develop their own regional compliance and enforcement program with their members.  My request remains that each of the regions sign the agreement by the March 30 Board meeting.  That will assure that we are able to make the governance changes that we have all been working for.  If any region is unable to sign by March 30, then use of the letter of intent would be a way to demonstrate support for the program.  That may be enough to satisfy those who have stated that moving forward on the compliance program is a condition to their support of the governance changes.  Thanks very much for your consideration of the program and all the work you\\'ve put into this transition so far.  Please let me know if you have questions or if there is anything that we can do from here to be of assistance to you.    ']\n",

The EPSA staff draft of a letter to Barton on his RTO discussion proposal will be significantly strengthened and EPSA staff will start by incorporating the comments I sent over earlier in the week.  The original draft said the Barton RTO language only needed \"technical corrections.\"  EPSA staff reiterated that some member co. or cos. think Barton\\'s draft could have been worse.  My reply was this \"logic\" was like saying we should be grateful he shot us in the head instead of hanging us -- one method may be more \"humane\" but either way we are \"dead\" (OK, the analogy may be too rough -- but it made the point.)  (I subsequently confirmed that Reliant is the \"soft\" member -- their rep. told me they \"support the discussion draft although they wouldn\\'t object if it is strengthened.\")  A stronger EPSA letter with more specific reasons why we oppose the Barton discussion draft will be circulated among EPSA members today or Monday, with the goal of sending the letter first thing Tuesday when Congress returns.  Some wanted a general letter requesting a meeting, and deferring specific comments until the meeting.  I pointed out that Barton is speaking to subcommittee members right now and that we needed to copy them on a more detailed letter ASAP so they hear from us before Barton gets to them.  We will make the same contacts ourselves.  In fact, we have already started.  Spoke to Reps. Chip Pickering and Rep. Greg Walden, both subcommittee Republicans, this week (did same with staff to Rep. John Shimkus).  Key task when House staff return to work on Tuesday will be finding out where Ranking Member Rick Boucher is on the Barton RTO draft.  Barton implied at a conference earlier this week that he and Boucher are in agreement on RTOs.']\n"
