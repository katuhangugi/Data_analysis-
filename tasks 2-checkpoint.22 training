      "Paragraph 2: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2226 OF 2010 [Arising out of Special Leave to Appeal (C) No.26684 of 2008] State of Haryana & Ors. ... Appellants Versus Manoj Kumar ... Respondent\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Dalveer Bhandari, J.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 1\\. Leave granted.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 2\\. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 4.2.2008 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in a Civil Writ Petition No.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 12094 of 2007.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 3\\. The appellants are aggrieved by the impugned judgment of the High Court by which the High Court has set aside the 2 concurrent findings of courts below while exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 4\\. Brief facts which are necessary to dispose of this appeal are as under:-\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 5\\. On 10.11.1999, an agreement to sell a commercial plot measuring 788 sq.yards located on Delhi-Mathura Mewla Maharajpur, Faridabad was executed by Smt. Manjula Gulati in favour of respondent, Manoj Kumar. The entire sale consideration was paid and the actual possession was also given, but the sale deed was not executed till 9.2.2001.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 6\\. According to the appellants, in order to evade substantial stamp duty, the respondent filed a suit, without impleading the appellants as parties to the suit, for specific performance of agreement to sell dated 10.11.1999 executed by Smt. Gulati for the sale of property measuring 788 sq.yards for a total consideration of Rs.1,95,000/-. The suit was promptly decreed in favour of the respondent by the Civil Judge (Junior Division), Faridabad. The suit as a matter of fact was filed on 3 14.9.2000 and decreed on 9.2.2001 and no further appeal was filed which clearly indicated that the suit was filed between the parties only with the purpose to evade the substantial stamp duty. The court directed its Reader to execute the decree and get the sale deed registered in favour of the respondent. The Reader of the court at the court's direction appeared before the Sub Registrar on 9.2.2001 and got the sale deed registered in favour of the respondent for the property for a sale consideration of Rs.2,00,000/-. According to the appellants, the court decree was obtained by concealing the material facts in order to evade the actual payable stamp duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 7\\. According to the appellants, the Joint Sub Registrar, Faridabad made a report that the sale deed executed on 9.2.2001 by respondent Manoj Kumar and the owner Manjula Gulati was under-valued. According to him, no sale deed can be registered for an amount which is less than the amount fixed by the collector or the circle rate (Rs.4,200/- per Sq.Yard).\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 8\\. The total value of the land at the rate of Rs.4,200/- per Sq.Yard works out to be Rs.33,09,600/-. On that amount, 4 the stamp duty registration charges of the sale deed payable would be Rs.5,13,050/-. In the instant case, the respondent has only paid Rs.31,000/- towards the stamp duty which was obviously under-valued.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 9\\. The District Collector, Faridabad in his order directed the respondent to make payment of difference of the amount of stamp duty amounting to Rs.4,82,050/-.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 10\\. The interpretation of amended section 47(A) of the Haryana Act has to be in consonance with the notified circle rates and any value fixed below that would be in direct conflict with the prevalent law of the land and, therefore, liable to be struck down by the authorities.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: 11\\. Section 47-A of the Haryana Amendment to Stamp Act, as applicable to the parties, reads as under:- S.47-A. - Instruments under-valued, how to be dealt with. - (1) If the Registering Officer appointed under the [Registration Act, 1908] , while registering any instrument transferring any property, has reason to believe that the value of the property or the consideration, as the case may be, has not been truly set forth in the instrument, he may, after registering such instrument, refer the same to the Collector for determination of the value or consideration, as the case may be, and the proper duty payable thereon.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 5 (2) On receipt of reference under sub-section (1), the Collector shall, after giving the parties a reasonable opportunity of being heard and after holding an enquiry in such manner as may be prescribed by rules made under this Act, determine the value or consideration and the duty as aforesaid and the deficient amount of duty, if any, shall be payable by the person liable to pay the duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: (3) The Collector may suo motu, or on receipt of reference from the Inspector- General of Registration or the Registrar of a district, in whose jurisdiction the property or any portion thereof, which is the subject- matter of the instrument is situate, appointed under the [Registration Act, 1908] ; and the deficient amount of duty, if any, shall be payable by the person liable to pay the duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: 12\\. According to the District Collector, Faridabad the respondent did not truly set-forth the true value in the instrument, therefore, order under section 47-A was passed against him.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: 13\\. The respondent aggrieved by the said order of the District Collector filed an appeal before the Commissioner, Gurgaon 6 Division, Gurgaon (Haryana) challenging the order dated 6.12.2005. The Commissioner by order dated 8.6.2007 dismissed the appeal by holding that the Collector rate or circle rate prescribed for sale of land in village Mewla Maharajpur of commercial nature was Rs.4,200/- per sq.yard and the respondent was directed to pay the balance amount of stamp duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: 14\\. The respondent aggrieved by the said order of the Commissioner preferred a Civil Writ Petition No.12094 of 2007 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 15\\. The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution has set aside the concurrent findings of facts of the courts below and observed that \"where the specific performance of contract in respect of immovable property has been granted, the ostensible sale price given in the transfer deed is to be accepted by the Registering Authority.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 16\\. According to the High Court, this was done primarily on the two grounds, firstly, \"because the court has accepted that price and has decreed the suit for specific performance\";\n",
      "Paragraph 23: 7 secondly, \"there cannot be any opportunity with the vendee to fabricate an agreement of sale for showing the incorrect sale price because litigating parties would not ordinarily reach such an agreement and sign the fabricated document.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 17\\. The High Court further observed that \"the authenticity of the decree passed by the court cannot be questioned.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: Therefore, the genuineness of the sale price has to be presumed.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 18\\. The appellants were not parties in the first place in the said suit and, therefore, either in law or on facts could not be bound by such a decree hence, such observation and finding on the fact of it is illegal and liable to set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 19\\. The High Court in the impugned judgment has set aside the concurrent findings of fact of the courts below. The appellants aggrieved by the impugned judgment of the High Court have preferred this appeal. The appellants are particularly aggrieved by the observations of the High Court that \"the authenticity of the decree passed by the court cannot be questioned. Therefore, the genuineness of the sale price has to be presumed.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 28: 8\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 20\\. According to the appellants, the High Court failed to appreciate that the respondent had intentionally evaded payment of the true stamp duty. The circle rate or the collector rate for the sale of commercial plot of 788 sq.yards was Rs.5,13,050 whereas the respondent paid only Rs.31,000/-. Hence the respondent was under the bounden obligation to pay the balance amount of Rs.4,82,050/-.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: 21\\. The appellants also urged that when the respondent had paid the full amount of sale consideration on 10.11.1999, then why was the sale deed executed only on 9.2.2001? The respondent has given no explanation for non- registration of sale deed for such a long time.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: 22\\. The appellants urged that the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 is very limited and the High Court, while exercising the jurisdiction under Article 227, has to ensure that the courts below work within the bounds of their authority.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 23\\. More than half a century ago, the Constitution Bench of this court in [?CITATION?] settled that power under Article 227 is limited to seeing that the courts below function within the limit of its authority or jurisdiction.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 24\\. This court placed reliance on Nagendra Nath's case in a subsequent judgment in [?CITATION?] The court observed that jurisdiction conferred under Article 227 is not by any means appellate in its nature for correcting errors in the decisions of subordinate courts or tribunals but is merely a power of superintendence to be used to keep them within the bounds of their authority.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: 25\\. This court had an occasion to examine this aspect of the matter in the case of [?CITATION?] . The court observed as under:- \"The supervisory jurisdiction conferred on the High Courts under Article 227 of the Constitution is limited \"to seeing that an inferior Court or Tribunal functions within the limits of its authority,\" and not to correct an error apparent on the face of the record, much less an error of law. for this case there was, in our opinion, no error of law much less an error apparent on the face of the record. There was no failure on the part of the learned Subordinate Judge to exercise jurisdiction nor did he act in 10 disregard of principles of natural justice. Nor was the procedure adopted by him not in consonance with the procedure established by law. In exercising the supervisory power under Article 227, the High Court does not act as an Appellate Court or Tribunal. It will not review or reweigh the evidence upon which the determination of the inferior court or tribunal purports to be based or to correct errors of law in the decision.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 26\\. This court again clearly reiterated the legal position in [?CITATION?] The court again cautioned that the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution cannot assume unlimited prerogative to correct all species of hardship or wrong decisions. It must be restricted to cases of grave dereliction of duty and flagrant abuse of fundamental principles of law or justice, where grave injustice would be done unless the High Court interferes.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 27\\. A three-Judge Bench of this court in [?CITATION?] again abundantly made it clear that the High Court cannot interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the subordinate court or the tribunal while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: Its function is limited to seeing that the subordinate court or 11 the tribunal functions within the limits of its authority. It cannot correct mere errors of fact by examining the evidence and re-appreciating it.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 28\\. In [?CITATION?] this court held that the limited power under Article 227 cannot be invoked except for ensuring that the subordinate courts function within its limits.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 29\\. This court over 50 years has been consistently observing that limited jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 cannot be exercised by interfering with the findings of fact and set aside the judgments of the courts below on merit.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 30\\. According to the appellants, the High Court was not justified in interfering with the findings of fact of the courts below. Consequently, the impugned judgment of the High Court is totally unsustainable.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 31\\. Mr. Manoj Swarup, Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent supported the impugned judgment. According to him, the enquiry under section 47-A is confined to whether value has not been truly set forth in the instrument.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 12 According to him, the Legislature has expressed its intention clearly by emphasizing the detail i.e. that value as set forth in the instrument. Or else, the Legislature would have used the terminology `market value' or `circle rates'.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 32\\. Mr. Swarup placed reliance on [?CITATION?] This Court in this case held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 44: \"5\\. It will be only on objective satisfaction that the Authority has to reach a reasonable belief that the instrument relating to the transfer or property has not been truly set forth or valued or consideration mentioned when it is presented for registration......\n",
      "Paragraph 45: ........\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 6\\. It would thus be seen that the aforesaid guidelines would inhibit the Registering Authority to exercise his quasi-judicial satisfaction of the true value of the property or consideration reflected in the instrument presented before him for registration. The statutory language clearly indicates that as and when such an instrument is presented for registration, the sub-Registrar is required to satisfy himself, before registering the document, whether true price is reflected in the instrument as it prevails in the locality...........\"\n",
      "Paragraph 47: 33\\. Mr. Swarup further submitted \"that circle rates have been held to constitute only one of the factors to be taken into consideration. Circle rates cannot be regarded as the last 13 word on the subject. This Court in the case of [?CITATION?] held that:- \"22.....The authorities cannot regard the guideline valuation as the last word on the subject of market value.....\"\n",
      "Paragraph 48: \"24....It is clear, therefore, that guideline value is not sacrosanct as urged on behalf of the appellants, but only a factor to be taken note of if at all available in respect of an area in which the property transferred lies.........\"\n",
      "Paragraph 49: 34\\. In the light of the above it is submitted that circle rates could have been taken as one of the factors and not the last word on the subject. The other factors being:- i) the price agreed upon between the vendor and the vendee ii) whether it was a distress sale iii) whether the price in the local area had gone down/escalated - at the time of the sale iv) Other relevant factors\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 35\\. It is submitted that these other factors have not been considered, not even noticed by the Authority under the Act.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 36\\. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. We are clearly of the opinion that the High Court, in the impugned judgment, has erred in interfering with the 14 concurrent findings of fact of the courts below under its limited jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution. The High Court erroneously observed that the \"the authenticity of the decree passed by the court cannot be questioned.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: Therefore, the genuineness of the sale price has to be presumed.\" This finding of the High Court cannot be sustained. It would have far reaching ramifications and consequences. If the genuineness of the sale price entered into by the buyer and the seller cannot be questioned, then in majority of the cases it is unlikely that the State would ever receive the stamp duty according to the circle rate or the collector rate. The approach of the High Court is totally unrealistic.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 37\\. The High Court in the impugned judgment has also erroneously observed that \"there cannot be any opportunity with the vendee to fabricate an agreement of sale for showing the incorrect sale price because the litigating parties would not ordinarily reach such an agreement and sign the fabricated document.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 54: 15\n",
      "Paragraph 55: 38\\. The High Court gravely erred in not properly comprehending the facts of this case in proper perspective and which has led to grave miscarriage of justice.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 39\\. It is not disputed that the commercial plot of 788 sq.yards located at Delhi-Mathura Mewla Maharajpur, Faridabad was valued by the Circle rate at Rs.4,200 per sq.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: yard fixed by the Collector of Faridabad meaning thereby that after the notification, no sale deed can be registered for an amount lesser than Rs.4,200/- per sq.yard. It may be pertinent to mention that, in order to ensure that there is no evasion of stamp duty, circle rates are fixed from time to time and the notification is issued to that effect. The issuance of said notification has become imperative to arrest the tendency of evading the payment of actual stamp duty. It is a matter of common knowledge that usually the circle rate or the collector rate is lower than the prevalent actual market rate but to ensure registration of sale deeds at least at the circle rates or the collector rates such notifications are issued from time to time by the appellants.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: 16\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 40\\. In the impugned judgment, the High Court has not properly construed the observations of the District Collector, Faridabad in which he has clearly stated as under :- \"It appears that the suit has been filed in the Civil Court and decree passed with the intention to avoid tax and stamp duty to be paid to the Government, because when respondent had paid entire sale consideration to the vendor, then he should have got the sale deed also executed at that time, whereas the same has not been done. Therefore, keeping into consideration the above facts, I come to this conclusion that sale deed No.11200 dated 9.2.2001 has been executed in respect of land measuring 788 sq.yard situated in village Mewla Maharajpur, which abuts Delhi Mathur Road. This plot is commercial and this fact has been concealed by the respondent. The sale deed had been registered for less value. The market value of the land in dispute as per Collector rate is Rs.33,09,600/- on which a total stamp duty of Rs.5,13,050/- was payable whereas the respondent has affixed stamp duty of Rs.31,000/-. In this manner on the above deed, the stamp duty of Rs.4,82,050/- is payable, which is ordered to be recovered from the respondent in accordance with law.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 41\\. This order was upheld by the Commissioner. The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227 has 17 set aside the orders passed by the District Collector, Faridabad and upheld by the Commissioner, Gurgaon without any basis or rationale. Apart from the jurisdiction, even what is factually stated in the order of the District Collector, Faridabad as upheld by the Commissioner, Gurgaon is unexceptionable and any interference was totally unwarranted.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 42\\. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained and is accordingly set aside and the order passed by the District Collector, Faridabad which was upheld by the Commissioner, Gurgaon is restored. The respondent is directed to pay the balance stamp duty within four weeks from the date of this judgment, otherwise the appellants would be at liberty to take appropriate steps in accordance with law.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: 43\\. The appeal is allowed and disposed of. The parties are directed to bear their respective costs.\n",

All of them retired prior to 1.1.1996. These petitions involve a common question relating to calculation of their pension.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: 2\\. Defence Ministry Circular dated 31.12.1965 barred private practice (which was a traditionally enjoyed privilege) by AMC officers with effect from 1.1.1966 and conveyed the sanction of the President to the grant of a Non- Practising Allowance ('NPA' for short) to all AMC officers irrespective of the rank, with a stipulation that such NPA shall be treated as Pay for all purposes. Ministry circular dated 2.11.1987 clarified that NPA will be treated as 'pay' for all service matters, and will be taken into account for computing Dearness Allowance and other allowances as well as for calculation of retirement benefits. It also prescribed the rate of NPA for AMC and ADC Officers as Rs. 600/- for basic pay below Rs. 3000/-, Rs.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 800/- for basic pay between Rs. 3000/- and Rs. 3700/- and Rs. 900/- for basic pay of Rs. 3700/- and above. The NPA was revised as 25% of basic pay and Rank pay, with effect from 1.1.1996 (subject to the condition that pay plus NPA does not exceed Rs. 29,500/-). G.O. No. 2/S/98, issued by the Ministry, which implemented the Fifth Central Pay Commission recommendations in regard to revision of pay scales, gave the benefit of the revised NPA to all AMC, ADC and RVC officers who were receiving NPA.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 3\\. The recommendations of Fourth Central Pay Commission in regard to pensionary benefits for Armed Force Officers retiring on or after 1.1.1986 were implemented by Ministry Circular dated 30.10.1987. The said Circular provided that retiring pension of all commissioned officers of the three services, shall be calculated at 50 per cent of the reckonable emoluments, for a qualifying service of 33 years (to be reduced proportionately for lesser qualifying service). It defined 'reckonable emoluments' for purposes of retiring/service pension as average of pay, NPA and rank pay, if any, drawn by the officer during the last 10 months of his service. It defined the term 'pay' as basic pay in the revised pay scales.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 4\\. The recommendations of the Fifth Central Pay Commission were accepted and accorded sanction by the President on 24.11.1997.\n",

      "Paragraph 8: Re : Pensioners retiring on and after 1.1.1996 The Ministry issued a circular dated 3.2.1998, providing that the retiring pension of Armed Force Officer retiring on or after 1.1.1996 shall be calculated at 50% of average of reckonable emoluments during the last 10 months of service, (reckonable emoluments being basic pay including rank pay, stagnation increment and NPA) for a qualifying service of 33 years, to be reduced proportionately for lesser period of qualifying service.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 5\\. The Ministry by Circular dated 7.6.1999, conveyed the decision of the President that 'with effect from 1.1.1996, pension of all Armed Forces pensioners irrespective of their date of retirement shall not be less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996 of the rank, held by the pensioner.' The circular provided that the revision of pension should be undertaken as follows in case of commissioned officers (both post and pre 1.1.1996 retirees) :\n",
      "Paragraph 10: i) \"Pension shall continue to be calculated at 50% of the average emoluments in all cases and shall be subject to a minimum of Rs.1275/- p.m. and a maximum of upto 50% of the highest pay applicable to Armed Forces personnel but the full pension in no case shall be less than 50% of the minimum of the revised scale of pay introduced w.e.f. 1.1.96 for the rank last held by the Commissioned Officer at the time of his/her retirement. However, such pension shall be reduced pro rata, where the pensioner has less than the maximum required service for full pension.

      "Paragraph 12: 6\\. The implementing departments had some doubts in regard to interpretation of the circular dated 7.6.1999. They therefore, sought clarifications from the Ministry on the following two issues  (i) whether NPA admissible as on 1.1.1986 is to be taken into consideration after refixation of pay on notional basis as on 1.1.1986; and (ii) whether NPA is to be added to the minimum of the revised scale while considering stepping up the consolidated pension on 1.1.1996. The Ministry issued the following clarification, vide Circular dated 11.9.2001, in regard to the Circular dated 7.6.1999 :\n",
      "Paragraph 13: \"The undersigned is directed to refer to Ministry of Defence letter No.1(1)/99/D(Pension/Services) dated 7th June, 1999, wherein decision of the government that pension of all pensioners irrespective of their date of retirement shall not be less than 50% of the minimum of the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.96 of the post last held by the pensioner was communicated.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: NPA granted to medical officers does not form part of the scales of pay. It is a separate element, although it is taken into account for the purpose of computation of pension.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: This has been examined in consultation with the Deptt. of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare and the Department of Expenditure and it is clarified that NPA is not to be taken into consideration after re-fixation of pay on notional basis on 1.1.1986. It is also not to be added to the minimum of the revised scale of pay as on 1.1.1996 in cases where consolidated pension is to be stepped up to 50%, in terms of Ministry of Defence Letter No.1(1)/99/D (Pension/Services) dated 7th June, 1999.\" [Emphasis supplied] The Circular also directed the Controller General of Defence Accounts to recalculate the pension by excluding NPA from Basic Pay and await further instructions regarding recovery of excess payments made with effect from 1.1.1996. In view of it, the pension of the petitioners have been revised by excluding the NPA element, by issuing corrigenda to their PPOs.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 7\\. The writ petitioners are aggrieved by the said clarification contained in the Circular dated 11.9.2001 and the consequential corrigenda to their PPOs reducing their pension.

      "Paragraph 25: CONTENTIONS OF PENSIONERS :\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 9\\. The petitioners have urged the following contentions :- 9.1) The Defence Service Medical Officers were earlier entitled to private practice. The permission to private practice was withdrawn with effect from 1.1.1966 and in lieu of it, the President sanctioned a non-practising allowance (NPA) with the stipulation that such NPA will be treated as 'Pay' for all purposes. As a consequence, in respect of Medical Officers, NPA was always treated as part of 'pay' for purposes of pension. By Circular dated 7.6.1999, the benefit of stepping up was extended to all armed forces pensioners, including medical officers, with effect from 1.1.1996. The benefit extended was that irrespective of their date of retirement, their pension shall not be less than the 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996 of the rank held by the respective pensioner. The words \"minimum pay\" should be interpreted as minimum pay in the revised pay-scale plus NPA, in so far as Medical Officers entitled to NPA, as in their cases, the term 'Pay' wherever it occurs, means and includes basic pay plus NPA.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 9.2) The Ministry had correctly understood the term \"50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay,\" used in the circular dated 7.6.1999 as \"50% of the minimum in the revised pay-scale plus NPA\", and on that basis issued modified PPOs., revising the pension. For example, in the case of Lt.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: Generals, where the applicable revised pay scale was Rs.22,400-525-24,500, the Ministry took the minimum in the revised scale of pay (Rs.22,400/-) and added 25% thereof (Rs.5,600/-) as NPA and arrived at the pension as Rs.14,000/- being 50% of the aggregate sum of Rs. 28,000/-. The Circular dated 11.9.2001, under the guise of a clarification, directed that NPA be omitted while calculating the 50% of the minimum pay in the revised pay scales, for purposes of stepping up. This amounted to unauthorized modification of the President's decision contained in the Ministry's Circular dated 7.6.1999. It is also opposed to the rule that in the case of Medical Officers, 'Pay' includes NPA, for all purposes. The Ministry had no authority to modify or dilute the President's Policy decision which is given effect by Circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 9.3) In the case of Medical Officers who retired on or after 1.1.1996, even after the clarificatory circular dated 11.9.2001, NPA is added to the basic pay in the revised pay-scale and 50% of the aggregate is being paid as 'retiring pension'. Adding NPA to the basic pay for arriving at the pension in the case of those who retired on or after 1.1.1996 and omitting to add NPA in the case of pre 1996 retirees amounts to hostile discrimination of pre 1996 retirees, violating Article 14 and the principles relating to pension laid down by this Court in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 30: 9.4) The Delhi High Court had struck down a similar clarificatory Circular dated 19.10.1999 relating to Civilian Medical Officers (corresponding to Defence Ministry Circular dated 11.9.2001 under challenge in these petitions) by judgment dated 18.5.2002. That decision has attained finality and the Union of India has implemented it by reverting back to addition to NPA to minimum pay, for purposes of stepping up the pension in regard to pre 1996 civilian Medical Officers. Union of India has to extend to similar treatment, even in the case of Defence Service Medical Officers, by ignoring the clarification dated 11.9.2001.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: 9.5) At all events, irrespective of the validity of the clarification dated 11.9.2001, even if any amount has been wrongly paid to petitioners, the Respondents cannot recover such excess amount paid in pursuance of the Circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: QUESTIONS ARISING FOR DECISION :\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 10\\. On the contentions urged, the following questions arise for consideration :\n",
      "Paragraph 34: (i) Whether the Circular dated 11.9.2001, is only a clarification, or an amendment, to the Circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: (ii) Whether the Circular dated 7.6.1999 as clarified by Circular dated 11.9.2001, leads to unequal treatment of those who retired prior to 1.1.1996 and those who retired after 1.1.1996 solely with reference to date of retirement.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: (iii) Whether the respondents having accepted and implemented the decision of the Delhi High Court (in Dr. K.C. Garg vs. Union of India  C.M.P. No. 7322/2001 and connected cases decided on 18.5.2002) on a similar issue, are required to extend a similar treatment to Defence Service Medical Officers also, by cancelling the Circular dated 11.9.2001.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: (iv) Even if the Circular dated 11.9.2001 is found to be valid, whether Respondents are not entitled to recover the excess payments made.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Re : Question No. (i) :\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 11\\. We may first refer to the intent and purport of the Circular dated 7.6.1999. The Circular dated 7.6.1999 neither prescribes the requirements/qualifications for entitlement to pension nor the method of determination of pension. It only effectuates the President's decision that the pension (Which has already been determined in accordance with the applicable rules/orders) irrespective of the date of retirement, shall not be less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scales of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996. Pension is determined as per relevant rules/orders, by calculating the average of reckonable emoluments (basic pay, Rank Pay and NPA) drawn during the last 10 months of service and then taking 50% thereof as the retiring pension applicable to retirees with 33 years of qualifying service, with proportionate reduction for retirees with lesser period of qualifying service. The basis for calculating the pension in respect of those who retired prior to 1.1.1996, and those retired on or after 1.1.1996 happens to be the same. The retiring pension is 50% of the average reckonable emoluments for retirees with 33 years of qualifying service, with proportionate reduction for those with lesser years of qualifying service.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: The President's decision given effect by Circular dated 7.6.1999 only extends to all pre 1996 retirees, who did not have the benefit of fixation of pension with reference to the revised pay scales which came into effect on 1.1.1996, the benefit of the said revised pay scales, albeit in a limited manner. In so doing, it also puts those who retired on or after 1.1.1986 and pre 1986 retirees on par and on a common platform, removing the disparity, if any, in their pensions.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 12\\. When the Fifth Central Pay Commission recommendations were implemented, the pension of those who retired prior to 1.1.1996, was rationalized by directing that their pension shall be the aggregate of (a) existing pension; (b) dearness relief; (c) interim relief I; (d) interim relief II, and (e) fitment weightage of 40% of the existing pension. The 'existing pension' referred to therein was the pension which had been arrived at by calculating 50% of the average pay, NPA and Rank Pay during the last 10 months of service. The Circular dated 7.6.1999 made it clear that pension of retirees shall continue to be calculated at 50% of average of reckonable emoluments for the last 10 months before retirement, but only stipulated that the 'full' pension (that is pension for 33 years service) shall not be less than the 50% of the minimum pay in the revised pay scale introduced with effect from 1.1.1996. The Circular dated 7.6.1999 also made it clear that if the minimum prescribed therein was not beneficial to the pensioner, that is, where it was either equal to or less than the existing consolidated pension, his pension will not be reduced to his disadvantage. In short, the Circular dated 7.6.1999, merely stepped up the pension (for a qualifying service of 33 years) to 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996 of the rank held by such pensioner, where his pension was less. We may here note that whenever the reference is to stepping up pension to 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay, it applies to those with 33 years of qualifying service and gets proportionately reduced for lesser period of qualifying service.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 13\\. The emoluments of those who retired on or after 1.1.1996, calculated with reference to the basic pay in the revised scale of pay plus NPA will certainly be more than the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay and therefore, in their cases, the question of stepping up will not arise. On the other hand, as the pension of pre-1996 retirees was based on the basic pay under the old pay scale plus NPA, and as the old pay scale was much less than the 1996 revised pay scale, their pension required to be stepped up. The extent to which the existing pension should be stepped up is clearly specified in the Circular as \"minimum pay in the revised scale of pay\". The words used do not give room for any confusion or doubt. A 'pay scale' has basically three elements. The first is the minimum pay or initial pay in the pay scale. The second is the periodical increment. The third is the maximum pay in the pay scale. An employee starts with the initial pay in the pay scale and gets periodical increases (increments) and reaches the maximum or ceiling in the pay scale. Each stage in the pay scale starting from the initial pay and ending with the ceiling in the pay scale, when applied to an employee is referred to as 'basic pay' of the employee. Whenever the government revises the pay scales, a fitment exercise takes place as per the principle of fitment (formula) provided in the rules governing the revision of pay so that the 'basic pay' in the old scale is converted into a 'basic pay' in the revised pay scale. When the circular dated 7.6.1999 used the words '50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay', it referred to 50% of the initial pay in the revised scale of pay. If the old scale of pay was Rs.7300- 100-7600 and if the revised scale of pay was Rs.22400-525-24500, the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay would be Rs.22400 and 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay would be Rs. 11200/-.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 14\\. It is no doubt true that the term 'pay', with reference to medical officers, includes the basic pay and NPA. But the term 'basic pay' does not include NPA. In the absence of any special definition, the term 'basic pay of a government servant' refers to the applicable stage of pay in the pay scale to which he is entitled, and does not include NPA even in the case of Medical Officers. What the circular dated 7.6.1999 intended to extend by way of benefit to all pensioners, was a minimum pension, that is, 50% of the minimum pay in the 1996 revised scale of pay. NPA has no part to play in the minimum that is sought to be assured. NPA has relevance only for initial fixation of pension and not for stepping up pension under Circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 15\\. As a result, if the pension of a retiree is determined by taking into account NPA as part of 'pay' and the pension so determined is more than 50% of minimum pay in the revised scale of pay, he would continue to get such higher pension. This would happen in the case of all those who retired on or after 1.1.1996. If the pension determined by taking into account NPA as part of pay, is less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay, his pension would be stepped up to 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay. This would happen in the case of pre 1996 retirees.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 16\\. The petitioners want to read the words \"not less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay\" in the Circular dated 7.6.1999, as \"not less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay plus NPA\". When the language used is clear and unambiguous and the intention is also clear, it is not permissible to add words to the Circular dated 7.6.1999 to satisfy what petitioners consider to be just and reasonable. \"Minimum pay in the revised scale of pay\" refers only to the initial pay in the revised scale of pay and not anything more. Due to a misinterpretation, NPA was included for the purpose of giving the benefit of stepping up the pension in the case of retired medical officers. The fact that NPA had already been taken into account while calculating the 'existing pension' of the medical officers who retired before 1.1.1996 was lost sight of. The fact that NPA is part of 'pay' and not part of 'basic pay' was also overlooked. Therefore, it became necessary to issue the clarification, which was done by circular dated 11.9.2001, clarifying that it was impermissible to again add NPA to 'the minimum pay in the revised pay scale' for the purpose of stepping up the pension.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 17\\. Another grievance of the petitioners is that prior to circular dated 7.6.1999, the pay and pension of medical officers was always more than the pay and pension of non-medical officers of the same rank, in view of NPA element, and by virtue of the clarificatory circular dated 11.9.2001, the pension of both categories, (Medical Officers and non-Medical Officers), who retired prior to 1996, became equal. The petitioners contend that even after stepping up under Circular dated 7.6.1999, the disparity which earlier existed between Medical Officers and Non-Medical Officers of the same rank, should be maintained. They point out that if the pension of medical officers and non- medical officers of the same rank should be the same, the purpose of giving NPA as part of pay to Medical Officers was defeated and NPA became illusory. We cannot agree. When the purpose of stepping up pension is to ensure that all retirees of the same rank get pension which is not less than the prescribed minimum, it would be unjust for a section to say that merely because they were earlier enjoying a higher pension than others of the same rank, such disparity should be continued, even after stepping up.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: When the object of stepping up of pension is to bring in parity and avoid disparity, the claim of petitioners that disparity should be continued cannot be accepted.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 18\\. We, therefore, hold that circular dated 11.9.2001, is only a clarification to correct the wrong interpretation of the circular dated 7.6.1999. It neither amends nor modifies the circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: Re : Question No. (ii)\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 19\\. The petitioners next contend that in the case of Medical Officers who retired on or after 1.1.1996, even after the Circulars dated 7.6.1999 and 11.9.2001, NPA is added to basic pay for the purpose of calculating the pension, whereas in the case of pre 1996 retirees, NPA is not being added and that amounts to discrimination. This is a misleading contention. In the case of those retiring on or after 1.1.1996, NPA is added to basic pay, to determine their pension, and not for stepping up the pension. In the case of pre 1996 retirees, as NPA was already added while determining their pension, the question of adding it again, for purposes of stepping up the pension, does not arise.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 20\\. The principles relating to pension relevant to the issue are well settled.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: They are :\n",
      "Paragraph 53: a) In regard to pensioners forming a class, computation of pension cannot be by different formula thereby applying an unequal treatment solely on the ground that some retired earlier and some retired later. If the retiree is eligible for pension at the time of his retirement and the relevant pension scheme is subsequently amended, he would become eligible to get enhanced pension as per the new formula of computation of pension from the date when the amendment takes effect. In such a situation, the additional benefit under the amendment, made available to the same class of pensioners cannot be denied to him on the ground that he had retired prior to the date on which the aforesaid additional benefit was conferred.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: b) But all retirees retiring with a particular rank do not form a single class for all purposes. Where the reckonable emoluments as on the date of retirement (for the purpose of computation of pension) are different in respect of two groups of pensioners, who retired with the same rank, the group getting lesser pension cannot contend that their pension should be identical with or equal to the pension received by the group whose reckonable emolument was higher. In other words, pensioners who retire with the same rank need not be given identical pension, where their average reckonable emoluments at the time of their retirement were different, in view of the difference in pay, or in view of different pay scales being in force.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: c) When two sets of employees of the same rank retire at different points of time, it is not discrimination if :\n",
      "Paragraph 56: (i) when one set retired, there was no pension scheme and when the other set retired, a pension scheme was in force.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: (ii) when one set retired, a voluntary retirement scheme was in force and when the other set retired, such a scheme was not in force; or (iii) when one set retired, a PF scheme was applicable and when the other set retired, a pension scheme was in place.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: One set cannot claim the benefit extended to the other set on the ground that they are similarly situated. Though they retired with the same rank, they are not of the 'same class' or 'homogeneous group'. The employer can validly fix a cut-off date for introducing any new pension/retirement scheme or for discontinuance of any existing scheme. What is discriminatory is introduction of a benefit retrospectively (or prospectively) fixing a cut off date arbitrarily thereby dividing a single homogeneous class of pensioners into two groups and subjecting them to different treatment.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: [Vide [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]]\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 21\\. As noticed earlier, pension is determined with reference to the applicable rules/orders governing pension. The Ministry's Circular dated 7.6.1999 comes in, only to step up the pension from 1.1.1996, if the pension calculated in accordance with the rules/orders is less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996. There is no need to step up the pension of those who retired on or after 1.1.1996, as their pension will be more than or in no event less than the minimum provided under the circular dated 7.6.1999. The stepping up is required only to those who retired prior to 1.1.1996 as their pension was lower on account of the fact that their reckonable emoluments for purpose of calculation of pension, was based on the old scales of pay. Let us take the case of a Medical Officer of the rank Lt. General, with 33 years of service, who retired in the year 1998 after getting two increments in the revised pay scale. As the applicable pay scale is Rs.22400-525-24500, his basic pay would have been Rs.23,450/- at the time of retirement. 25% thereof namely Rs.5863/- would be the NPA. If the reckonable emolument was Rs.29313/-, pension will be 50% thereof, namely Rs.14656/-. As the pension under the Rules (Rs.14656/-) was more than 50% of the minimum of revised pay scale (Rs.11200/-) assured under the circular dated 7.6.1999, the benefit of stepping up is not required in his case. It is only those whose pension was determined with reference to old scales of pay, and not the revised higher scale of pay, who require the benefit of the stepping up. Therefore, the contention that pre 1996 retirees and post 1.1.1996 retirees are being treated differently, is untenable. They are treated similarly. But the fact that post 1.1.1996 retirees do not require the benefit of stepping up, cannot by any stretch of imagination, give rise to a contention that the benefit given to pre- 1996 retirees by way of stepping up, amounts to discrimination.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 22\\. The contention that NPA is taken into account in the case of post 1.1.1996 retirees but not pre 1996 retirees is untenable. NPA is taken as part of 'pay' in the case of both pre and post 1.1.1996 retirees. NPA is not taken into account in the case of any retiree for applying the stepping up benefit under circular dated 7.6.1999. It is a different matter that post 1.1.1996 retirees do not require the benefit under the circular dated 7.6.1999. As already noticed, while calculating pension of the pre 1996 retirees, NPA had already been taken into account as part of 'pay', and that pension which was determined after taking into account NPA, is found to be less than the minimum guaranteed under the circular dated 7.6.1999, their pension is being increased to the minimum provided in the circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: NPA cannot again be added to the minimum to step up the pension. If that is done, it will amount to taking NPA into account twice for purposes of pension, which is impermissible. The contention of discrimination between pre 1.1.1996 retirees and post 1.1.1996 retirees is, therefore, imaginary.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: Re : Question No. (iii)\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 23\\. It was alleged that in the case of civilian medical officers, the nodal Ministry had issued circulars dated 17.12.1998 and 29.10.1999 (corresponding to the Defence Ministry's Circulars dated 7.6.1999 and 11.9.2001); that some civilian Medical Officer Retirees had challenged the said circular dated 29.10.1999 directing that NPA shall not be added to minimum pay in the revised scale, before the Delhi High Court; that the High Court had allowed the said writ petitions (CWP No.7322/2001 and connected cases  K. G. Garg vs. Union of India) by order dated 18.5.2002;\n",
      "Paragraph 65: and that the said order was not challenged by the Union of India, but on the other hand, was implemented by adding NPA to basic pay while stepping up the pension in the case of civilian Medical Doctors who had retired prior to 1.1.1996. It is contended that the Respondents having accepted and implemented the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of civilian medical officers, cannot discriminate against the Defence service medical officers placed in identical position and therefore the benefit given to the civilian medical officers in pursuance of the decision of the Delhi High Court should also be extended to them. The petitioners rely on the broad principles underlying estoppel by Judgment, legitimate expectation, and fairness in action in support of their contention.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 24\\. Respondents have filed an affidavit dated 1.8.2006 admitting that in pursuance of the decision of the Delhi High Court, the circular dated 29.10.999 had been withdrawn but clarified that it was withdrawn only in regard to the civilian medical officers who were petitioners in the said writ petititions and not in regard to all civilian medical officers. It is contended that the fact that a decision of the High Court had been accepted or implemented in the case of some persons, will not come in the way of the Union of India resisting similar petitions filed by others, in public interest.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 25\\. A similar contention was considered by this Court in [?CITATION?] This Court held :\n",
      "Paragraph 68: \"Sometimes, as it was stated on behalf of the State, the State Government may not choose to file appeals against certain judgments of the High Court rendered in Writ petitions when they are considered as stray cases and not worthwhile invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution, for seeking redressal therefor. At other times, it is also possible for the State, not to file appeals before this Court in some matters on account of improper advice or negligence or improper conduct of officers concerned. It is further possible, that even where S.L.Ps are filed by the State against judgments of High Court, such S.L.Ps may not be entertained by this Court in exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution either because they are considered as individual cases or because they are considered as cases not involving stakes which may adversely affect the interest of the State.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: Therefore, the circumstance of the non-filing of the appeals by the State in some similar matters or the rejection of some S.L.Ps in limine by this Court in some other similar matters by itself, in our view, cannot be held as a bar against the State in filing an S.L.P. or S.L.Ps in other similar matters where it is considered on behalf of the State that non-filing of such S.L.P. or S.L.Ps and pursuing them is likely to seriously jeopardize the interest of the State or public interest.\" The said observations apply to this case. A particular judgment of the High Court may not be challenged by the State where the financial repercussions are negligible or where the appeal is barred by limitation. It may also not be challenged due to negligence or oversight of the dealing officers or on account of wrong legal advice, or on account of the non-comprehension of the seriousness or magnitude of the issue involved. However, when similar matters subsequently crop up and the magnitude of the financial implications is realized, the State is not prevented or barred from challenging the subsequent decisions or resisting subsequent writ petitions, even though judgment in a case involving similar issue was allowed to reach finality in the case of others. Of course, the position would be viewed differently, if petitioners plead and prove that the State had adopted a 'pick and choose' method only to exclude petitioners on account of malafides or ulterior motives. Be that as it may. On the facts and circumstances, neither the principle of res judicata nor the principle of estoppel is attracted. The Administrative Law principles of legitimate expectation or fairness in action are also not attracted. Therefore, the fact that in some cases the validity of the circular dated 29.10.1999 (corresponding to the Defence Ministry circular dated 11.9.2001) has been upheld and that decision has attained finality will not come in the way of State defending or enforcing its circular dated 11.9.2001.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: Re : Question No. (iv)\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 25\\. The last question to be considered is whether relief should be granted against the recovery of the excess payments made on account of the wrong interpretation/understanding of the circular dated 7.6.1999. This Court has consistently granted relief against recovery of excess wrong payment of emoluments/allowances from an employee, if the following conditions are fulfilled [Vide [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], and [?CITATION?]] :\n",
      "Paragraph 72: a) The excess payment was not made on account of any misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the employee.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: b) Such excess payment was made by the employer by applying a wrong principle for calculating the pay/allowance or on the basis of a particular interpretation of rule/order, which is subsequently found to be erroneous.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: Such relief, restraining recovery back of excess payment, is granted by courts not because of any right in the employees, but in equity, in exercise of judicial discretion, to relieve the employees, from the hardship that will be caused if recovery is implemented. A Government servant, particularly one in the lower rungs of service would spend whatever emoluments he receives for the upkeep of his family. If he receives an excess payment for a long period, he would spend it genuinely believing that he is entitled to it. As any subsequent action to recover the excess payment will cause undue hardship to him, relief is granted in that behalf. But where the employee had knowledge that the payment received was in excess of what was due or wrongly paid, or where the error is detected or corrected within a short time of wrong payment, Courts will not grant relief against recovery. The matter being in the realm of judicial discretion, courts may on the facts and circumstances of any particular case refuse to grant such relief against recovery.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 26\\. On the same principle, pensioners can also seek a direction that wrong payments should not be recovered, as pensioners are in a more disadvantageous position when compared to in-service employees. Any attempt to recover excess wrong payment would cause undue hardship to them. The petitioners are not guilty of any misrepresentation or fraud in regard to the excess payment. NPA was added to minimum pay, for purposes of stepping up, due to a wrong understanding by the implementing departments. We are therefore of the view that Respondents shall not recover any excess payments made towards pension in pursuance of circular dated 7.6.1999 till the issue of the clarificatory circular dated 11.9.2001. In so far as any excess payment made after the circular dated 11.9.2001, obviously the Union of India will be entitled to recover the excess as the validity of the said circular has been upheld and as pensioners have been put on notice in regard to the wrong calculations earlier made.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 27\\. A faint attempt was made by the learned Addl. Solicitor General appearing for Respondent to contend that all such wrong payments could be recovered and at best the pensioners may be entitled to time or instalments to avoid hardship. No doubt in [?CITATION?], this Court did not bar the recovery of excess pay, but directed recovery in easy instalments. The said decision does not lay down a principle that relief from recovery should not be granted in regard to emoluments wrongly paid in excess, or that only relief in such cases is grant of instalments. A direction to recover the excess payment in instalments or a direction not to recover excess payment, is made as a consequential direction, after the main issue relating to the validity of the order refixing or reducing the pay/allowance/pension is decided. In some cases, the petitioners may merely seek quashing of the order refixing the pay and may not seek any consequential relief. In some cases, the petitioners may make a supplementary prayer seeking instalments in regard to refund of the excess payment if the validity of the order refixing the pay is upheld. In some other cases, the petitioners may pray that such excess payments should not be recovered. The grant of consequential relief would, therefore, depend upon the consequential prayer made. If the consequential prayer was not for waiving the excess payment but only for instalments, the court would obviously consider only the prayer for instalments. If any decision which upholds the refixation of pay/pension does not contain any consequential direction not to recover the excess payment already made or contains a consequential direction to recover the excess payment in instalments, it is not thereby laying down any proposition of law but is merely issuing consequential direction in exercise of judicial discretion, depending upon the prayer for consequential relief or absence of prayer for consequential relief as the case may be, and the facts and circumstances of the case. Many a time, the prayer for instalments or waiver of recovery of excess, is made not in the pleadings but during arguments or when the order is dictated upholding the order revising or re-fixating the pay/pension. Therefore, the decision in Sujatha Vedachalam (supra) will not come in the way of relief being granted to the pensioners in regard to the recovery of excess payments.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 28\\. The learned Additional Solicitor General next submitted that in so far as refund of the excess pension relating to the period 11.9.2001 to date, the petitioners who have obtained interim orders of stay, should be made liable to pay interest, as the petitioners had the benefit of such excess payment.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: Reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court in [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]. It is no doubt true that the petitioners, who have obtained orders of interim stay, have been receiving excess pension even after the clarification contained in the Circular dated 11.9.2001 and that they are bound to refund the excess received after 11.9.2001. But there was some amount of confusion on account of the earlier interpretation of the Circular dated 7.6.1999 by the Department itself. Further, the petitioners are all pensioners, who have prosecuted these petitions bonafide. In the circumstances, on the facts and circumstances, we do not propose to award of interest on the amounts to be refunded.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: Conclusion :\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 29\\. The Circulars dated 7.6.1999 and 11.9.2001 relate not only to pension but also family pension, the only difference being the percentage, that is, 30% is mentioned in respect of family pension instead of 50% in respect of pension. What we have discussed and held in respect of pension will apply to family pension also.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: 30\\. In view of the above, the challenge to the validity of the circular dated 11.9.2001 is rejected. These petitions (Transferred Cases) are dismissed. The Respondents, however, shall not recover the excess, if any, paid to the petitioners between 7.6.1999 and 11.9.2001. Respondents may recover the excess if any paid after 11.9.2001 in appropriate monthly instalments approximately equal to the monthly excess payment. Parties to bear respective costs.\n",

Notice of the said petition was given to the UOI who filed an application under Sections 30 and 33 of the Act raising certain objections against the Award. The objections filed by the UOI were rejected by the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Vasco-da-Gama vide judgment dated 8th April, 1996 and the Award dated 28th February, 1994 of the Arbitrator was made Rule of the Court with a further direction to the UOI to pay the contractor simple interest @ 18% p.a. on the principal amount adjudged in the Award from the date of the decree till the date of actual payment. Against the said order the UOI filed appeals before the High Court under Section 39 of the Act. The High Court by the judgment rendered on 29th February, 2000 allowed the appeals in part. The operative portion of the judgment reads as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 82: \"For the aforesaid reasons, the appeals are partly allowed. The claim for quantity of stone aggregate already brought after August, 1992 upto 20-4-1994 in Arbitration Appeal No.2 of 1996 and Arbitration Appeal No.3 of 1996 to the tune of Rs.11,35,760/- and Rs.5,90,000/-, respectively, is sustained. The interest awarded on the said claim by the Arbitrator is also sustained.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: Except for this, the remaining claims granted by the Arbitrator are set aside. In the facts and circumstances, we shall leave the parties to bear their costs.\" The High Court declined to interfere with the Award of the Arbitrator relating to claim Item No.1 upto 24.1.1994 when the statement of claims was filed before him by the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: The High Court held that the Award in respect of claim no.1 beyond 24-1-94 did not form part of the terms of reference and further that the future claim in respect of stone aggregate would be subject to various factors including market conditions and whether the shortage continued. The High Court further held that under the circumstances, the Arbitrator could not have granted relief relating to future claim of the contractor with reference to stone aggregate.\n",
      "Paragraph 85: The High Court recorded the following finding in this regard:- \"Therefore, while sustaining claim no.1 in both the appeals for the quantity of stone aggregate already brought after August 1992 upto 24-1-1994, and Award of Rs.11,35,760/- in Arbitration Appeal No.2 of 1996 and Rs.5,90,000/- in Arbitration Appeal No.3 of 1996, the remaining part of Order on claim no.1 is set aside.\" [See page 31 para 21 last portion] On claim no.2 the High Court interpreted clauses 3.3.2, 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 of the contract and held that excavation in any type of laterite rock, that is to say, soft or hard shall be treated as excavation in soft/disintegrated rock. The High Court further held that the Arbitrator had totally overlooked Clause 3.3.4 while coming to the conclusion on the basis of Clauses 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 alone. The High Court was of the view that the Arbitrator had not only misinterpreted the relevant clauses totally ignoring the Clause 3.3.4, but had also taken 'undue' interest in the matter in order to find out the classification of the strata which in fact, in view of Clause 3.3.4 would not have much relevance. The High Court held that the Arbitrator had misconducted himself and therefore, the Award against claim no.2 was totally unwarranted and invalid. According to the High Court, the view taken by the Arbitrator could not be said to be a possible view on the interpretation of Clauses 3.3.2, 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 read together. The High Court summed up its finding as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 86: \"For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the opinion that the Award under claim no.2 in both the Appeals cannot be sustained and is liable to be set aside.\" [see para 25 at page 36] In respect of claim no.3, the High Court took note of Clauses 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.3 of the Special Conditions in which provisions were made for inspection of the site prior to the filing of tender so that the tenderer was familiar with the working conditions, accessibility to site of works, etc. Regarding the security and passes to the persons who were required to enter the area in connection with the work in Special Condition 3.3 it was clearly stated that nothing extra shall be admissible for any man hours etc. lost on this account of the restrictions referred to under Special Condition no.3. The High Court held that the contractor had filed the tender knowing fully well the relevant provisions of the Special Conditions in the contract and as such he could not later on complain about such restrictions leading to reduced output of labourers, restricted working hours etc. The High Court opined that the conclusions arrived at by the Arbitrator were contrary to relevant Special Conditions which were part of the contract and as such, the Award of the claim under the said Award could not be sustained. Regarding claim no.4 which relates to interest, the High Court relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in [?CITATION?], held that: \"the Arbitrator has jurisdiction to award pre-reference interest in cases which arose after the [Interest Act, 1978] and the power of the arbitrator to award interest for the post-award period also exists, besides power to grant pendente lite interest\".\n",
      "Paragraph 87: The High Court found that the interest awarded by the arbitrator in relation to the claim for quantity of stone aggregate already brought after August, 1992 to 20-4-1994 could not be interfered with and that the pre-reference interest in respect of other items falls on account of rejection of claim nos.2 and 3. On such findings the High Court allowed the appeal in part and to the extent noted earlier.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: Shri V.A.Mohta, learned senior counsel appearing for the contractor i.e. the appellants in Appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.10526-527/2000 and respondents in Appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.880-881 of 2001, strenuously contended that the High Court exceeded the limits of the jurisdiction vested under Section 39 of the Act in deciding the appeals filed by the UOI, and in setting aside the Award of the Arbitrator in respect of claim nos.2 and 3. Shri Mohta further contended that even assuming that the High Court found that the arbitrator had mis-interpreted the relevant clauses of the agreement, then it was not open to it to interfere with the Award since there was no error of law apparent on the face of the award and the matter relating to interpretation of the conditions in the agreement was within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: Shri Anoop G.Chaudhary, learned senior counsel appearing for the UOI contended that the award of the arbitrator so far as part of the claim no.1 and claim nos.2 and 3 are concerned was contrary to the specific conditions provided in the agreement, and therefore, was patently erroneous and uncalled for. Shri Chaudhary further contended that the arbitrator being a creature of the agreement could not ignore the relevant stipulations in the contract nor could he travel beyond the terms of the contract. In the circumstances, Shri Chaudhary submitted, the judgment of the High Court does not call for interference by this Court in the appeal filed by the contractor under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: The provision for appeals against the orders passed under the Act is contained in Section 39 of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: The said Section is quoted hereunder :\n",
      "Paragraph 92: \"Appealable orders.-(a)An appeal shall lie from the following orders passed under this Act (and from no others) to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order:\n",
      "Paragraph 93: An order (i) superseding an arbitration;\n",
      "Paragraph 94: (ii) on an award stated in the form of a special case;\n",
      "Paragraph 95: (iii) modifying or correcting an award;\n",

      "Paragraph 98: (vi) setting aside or refusing to set aside an award;\n",
      "Paragraph 99: Provided that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any order passed by a Small Cause Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 100: (2) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the Supreme Court.\" On a plain reading of the section it is manifest that the section is restricted in its application. Only certain types of orders are made appealable under the provision. Being a special statute no appeal can be entertained except under Section 39. The principles on which the Court can interfere with an award or order passed under the Act are fairly well settled. The question has engaged the attention of this Court and different High Courts from time to time.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: In the case of [?CITATION?], this Court, construing Section 30 of the Act, observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 102: \"The law on this aspect is, however, settled.\n",
      "Paragraph 103: In [?CITATION?], this Court reiterated that in order to make arbitration effective and the awards enforceable, machinery was devised by the [Arbitration Act] for lending the assistance of the ordinary courts. The court was also entrusted with the power to modify or correct the award on the ground of imperfect form or clerical errors, or decision on questions not referred, which were severable from those referred. The Court had also power to remit the award when it had left some matters referred undetermined, or when the award was indefinite, where the objection to the legality of the award was apparent on the face of the award. The court might also set aside an award on the ground of corruption or misconduct of the arbitrator, or that a party had been guilty of fraudulent concealment or willful deception. But the court could not interfere with the award if otherwise proper on the ground that the decision appeared to it to be erroneous. The award of the arbitrator was ordinarily final and conclusive, unless a contrary intention was disclosed by the agreement. The award was the decision of a domestic tribunal chosen by the parties, and the civil courts which were entrusted with the power to facilitate arbitration and to effectuate the awards, could not exercise appellate powers over the decision. Wrong or right the decision was binding, if it be reached fairly after giving adequate opportunity to the parties to place their grievances in the manner provided by the arbitration agreement. This Court reiterated in the said decision that it was now firmly established that an award was bad on the ground of error of law on the face of it, when in the award itself or in a document actually incorporated in it, there was found some legal proposition which was the basis of the award and which was erroneous.\" This Court in the case of [?CITATION?], considered the reasons given in a speaking award and scope for the interference with such award.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: This Court in that connection made the following observations :\n",
      "Paragraph 105: \"In this case the reasons given by the arbitrator are cogent and based on materials on record. In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, Fourth Edition, page 2258 states that it would be unreasonable to expect an exact definition of the word \"reasonable\". Reason varies in its conclusions according to the idiosyncrasy of the individual, and the times and circumstances in which he thinks. The reasoning which built up the old scholastic logic sounds now like the jingling of a child's toy. But mankind must be satisfied with the reasonableness within reach; and in cases not covered by authority, the verdict of a jury or the decision of a judge sitting as a jury usually determines what is \"reasonable\" in each particular case. The word \"reasonable\" has in law the prima facie meaning of reasonable in regard to those circumstances of which the actor, called on to act reasonably, knows or ought to know. See the observations, in Re a Solicitor [?CITATION?] at 371.\n",
      "Paragraph 106: After all an arbitrator as a judge in the words of Benjamin N.Cardozo, has to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinated to \"the primordial necessity of order in the social life\".\n",
      "Paragraph 107: In the case of [?CITATION?], construing Section 30 of the Act, this Court observed that the award can be set aside if the arbitrator had mis-conducted himself or the proceedings and had proceeded beyond his jurisdiction; that these are separate and distinct grounds for challenging an award; that where there are errors apparent on the face of the award it can only be set aside if in the award there is any proposition of law which is apparent on the face of the award, namely, in the award itself or any document incorporated in the award.\n",
      "Paragraph 108: Reference was made to the decision of the Judicial Committee in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 109: Considering the point that only in a speaking award a Court can look into the reasoning of the award, this Court observed : \"..It is not open to the court to probe the mental process of the arbitrator and speculate, where no reasons are given by the arbitrator, as to what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at his conclusion\". In this connection reference was made to the observations in [?CITATION?]. Drawing a distinction between the disputes as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that jurisdiction should be exercised, this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 110: \"An award may be remitted or set aside on the ground that the arbitrator in making it, had exceeded his jurisdiction and evidence of matters not appearing on the face of it, will be admitted in order to establish whether the jurisdiction had been exceeded or not, because the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside the award whatever might be said about it in the award or by the arbitration.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: See in this connection, the observations of Russel on The Law of Arbitration, 20th edn., p.427. Also see the observations of [?CITATION?], 10 and [?CITATION?]. It has to be reiterated that an arbitrator acting beyond his jurisdiction is a different ground from the error apparent on the face of the award. In Halbury's Laws of England II, 4th edn., Vol.2, para 622 one of the misconducts enumerated, is the decision by the arbitrator on a matter which is not included in the agreement or reference.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: But in such a case one has to determine the distinction between an error within the jurisdiction and an error in excess of the jurisdiction. See the observations in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?], and [?CITATION?] But, in the instant case the court had examined the different claims not to find out whether these claims were within the disputes referable to the arbitrator, but to find out whether in arriving at the decision, the arbitrator had acted correctly or incorrectly. This, in our opinion, the court had no jurisdiction to do, namely, substitution of its own evaluation of the conclusion of law or fact to come to the conclusion that the arbitrator had acted contrary to the bargain between the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 113: Whether a particular amount was liable to be paid or damages liable to be sustained, was a decision within the competency of the arbitrator in this case. By purporting to construe the contract the court could not take upon itself the burden of saying that this was contrary to the contract and, as such, beyond jurisdiction. It has to be determined that there is a distinction between disputes as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that power of the arbitrator to grant a particular remedy.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: Xxx xxx xxx In the instant case, the High Court seems to have fallen into an error of deciding the question on interpretation of the contract. In the aforesaid view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the High Court was in error.\n",
      "Paragraph 115: It may be stated that if on a view taken of a contract, the decision of the arbitrator on certain amounts awarded, is a possible view though perhaps not the only correct view, the award cannot be examined by the court in the manner done by the High Court in the instant case.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: In light of the above, the High Court, in our opinion, had no jurisdiction to examine the different items awarded clause by clause by the arbitrator and to hold that under the contract these were not sustainable in the facts found by the arbitrator.\" In the case of [?CITATION?], this Court considering the point on lack of jurisdiction of the arbitrator held that when the conditions in the agreement specifically prohibited granting claim or damages for the breaches mentioned therein it was not open to the arbitrator to ignore the said conditions which were binding on the contracting parties; that by ignoring the same he has acted beyond the jurisdiction upon him;\n",
      "Paragraph 117: that it is settled law that the arbitrator derives authority from the contract and if he acts in manifest disregard of the contract, the award given by him would be an arbitrary one; that this deliberate departure from the contract amounts not only to manifest disregard of the authority or misconduct on his part, but it may tantamount to mala fide action. This Court further observed that the [Arbitration Act] does not give any power to the arbitrator to act arbitrarily or capriciously; that his existence depends upon the agreement and his function is to act within the limits of the said agreement. In para 17 of the judgment this Court made the following observations :\n",
      "Paragraph 118: \"It is to be reiterated that to find out whether the arbitrator has traveled beyond his jurisdiction and acted beyond the terms of the agreement between the parties, the agreement is required to be looked into. It is true that interpretation of a particular condition in the agreement would be within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. However, in cases where there is no question of interpretation of any term of the contract, but of solely reading the same as it is and still the arbitrator ignores it and awards the amount despite the prohibition in the agreement, the award would be arbitrary, capricious and without jurisdiction.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: Whether the arbitrator has acted beyond the terms of the contract or has traveled beyond his jurisdiction would depend upon facts, which however would be jurisdictional facts, and are required to be gone into by the court. The arbitrator may have jurisdiction to entertain claim and yet he may not have jurisdiction to pass award for particular items in view of the prohibition contained in the contract and, in such cases, it would be a jurisdictional error. For this limited purpose reference to the terms of the contract is a must. Dealing with a similar question this Court in [?CITATION?], held thus : (SCC p.79 para 9) \"It is axiomatic that the arbitrator being a creature of the agreement, must operate within the four corners of the agreement and cannot travel beyond it. More particularly, he cannot award any amount which is ruled out or prohibited by the terms of the agreement. In this case, the agreement between the parties clearly says that in measuring the built-up area, the balcony areas should be excluded. The arbitrators could not have acted contrary to the said stipulation and awarded any amount to the appellant on that account.\" In the case of [?CITATION?], this Court considered the question of Courts interference in case of a non-speaking award. This Court referred to the decision in New India Civil Erectors (P) Ltd (supra) in which it was held that the arbitrator being a creature of the contract must operate within the four corners of the contract cannot travel beyond it and he cannot award any amount which is ruled out or prohibited by the terms of the agreement and the decision in [?CITATION?], in which it was held that if the arbitrator commits an error in the construction of the contract, that is an error within his jurisdiction; but if he wanders outside the contract and deals with matter not allotted to him, he commits a jurisdictional error and an umpire or arbitrator cannot widen his jurisdiction by deciding a question not referred to him by the parties or by deciding a question otherwise than in accordance with the contract. This Court referring to [?CITATION?], held that the principle was unexceptionable. Summing up its decision, this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 120: \"However, from a reading of the decisions of this Court referred to earlier it is clear that when an award is made plainly contrary to the terms of the contract not by misinterpretation but which is plainly contrary to the terms of the contract it would certainly lead to an inference that there is an error apparent on the face of the award which results in jurisdictional error in the award. In such a case the courts can certainly interfere with the award made by the arbitrator.\" Considering the scope of Section 30 of the Act, this Court in the case of [?CITATION?], enumerated some of the well recognized grounds on which interference in award is permissible, observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 121: \"Interpreting the statutory provision courts have laid stress on the limitations on exercise of jurisdiction by the court for setting aside or interfering with an award in umpteen cases. Some of the well-recognised grounds on which interference is permissible are:\n",
      "Paragraph 122: (1) violation of the principle of natural justice in passing the award;\n",
      "Paragraph 123: (2) error apparent on the face of the award;\n",
      "Paragraph 124: (3) the arbitrator has ignored or deliberately violated a clause in the agreement prohibiting dispute of the nature entertained;\n",
      "Paragraph 125: (4) the award on the fact of it is based on a proposition of law which is erroneous etc.\" Testing the case on hand on the touchstone of well settled principles laid down by Courts, we are unable to hold that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering with the award or failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it to set aside the award. The approach of the High Court cannot be said to be contrary to the well settled principles governing the scope of interference with an award of the Arbitrator under the old Act. As regards the first item, the question was whether the contract contemplates the use of stone aggregate and stone metal from the local sources only, the source of supply being silent in the relevant clause. The Arbitrator was of the view that the unprecedented situation of the contractor being put to the necessity of procuring the stone material from far off places was not visualized and the parties proceeded on the basis that such material was available locally. He further noted that the sample kept in the office of the concerned Engineer admittedly pertained to the material procured from local sources. A letter addressed by the Chief Engineer in support of contractor's claim was also relied on in this context. Hence, in these circumstances, the Arbitrator can be said to have taken a reasonably possible view and therefore the High Court rightly declined to set aside the award in so far as the quantity of stone aggregate/stone metal brought to site up to 24.1.1994 is concerned. The Arbitrator acted within the confines of his jurisdiction in making the award on this part of the claim.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: As already noted, the award in so far as the future period is concerned, i.e. subsequent to 24.1.1994 which is the date of filing of claim statement, the High Court set aside the award on two grounds : (i) Such a claim did not form part of terms of reference, though the contractor had filed claim in respect of stone aggregate to be brought in future and (ii) the future claim in respect of stone aggregate would be subject to various factors including market conditions and whether the shortage continued.\n",
      "Paragraph 127: In our view the view taken by the High Court cannot be sustained. It is clear from the arbitration clause viz.\n",
      "Paragraph 128: clause 70 that all disputes between the parties to the contract (other than excepted matters) can be referred to arbitration. The contractor did make a claim in respect of future period also. The document appointing the Arbitrator would show that the Arbitrator was required to decide the disputes arising between the parties. It is not possible to hold that the claim No.1 in so far as it relates to future period during which the contract work continued is beyond the scope of reference or outside the ambit of arbitration clause. The aim of arbitration is to settle all the disputes between the parties and to avoid further litigation. There is no legal justification in restricting the scope of arbitration in the manner in which the High Court did. In the list of disputes which is annexed to the letter of appointment of the Arbitrator, it is mentioned without any qualification or restriction as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 129: \"Reimbursement of additional cost in procurement of stone aggregate from crusher of Belgaum, Hubli, etc. in lieu of local sources of Goa.\" The claim amount is mentioned as 36 lakhs and 8 lakhs. This figure is over and above the amount claimed upto 24.1.1994 and is based on an estimate. It is also relevant to mention that Union of India did not take the stand before the Arbitrator that the claim in respect of future was beyond the scope of reference. However, in order to obviate any controversy, it is made clear that the payment at the rates specified in the award should be made only in respect of stone aggregate actually brought to the site from Belgaum, Hubli and other distant places. It is open to the Engineer concerned to be satisfied on this aspect before satisfying the award. Obviously, if any part of the stone aggregate was brought subsequent to 24.1.1994 from local sources the directions in the award will be ineffective. The observations of the High Court that conditions may not be the same for the future and therefore the Arbitrator was incompetent to make an award for the future period cannot be supported for the simple reason that the extra rate will become applicable only in respect of quantities brought from sources other than local. It has never been the case of Union of India either before the Arbitrator or the High Court or even this Court that the situation had changed after 24.1.1994 and that the stone aggregate could be secured at lesser rates from local sources or otherwise. For all these reasons, we are of the view that the High Court ought not to have interfered with the award in so far as claim No.1 is concerned in any respect. To this extent, the appeals filed by the Contractor i.e. arising out of SLP Nos. 10526- 10527 of 2000 are partly allowed.\n",
      "Paragraph 130: As regards the other two items viz. 2 and 3, on a perusal of the judgment of the High Court and on consideration of the relevant clauses, we are of the view that the judgment does not suffer from any serious error in the approach to the matter. In regard to item No.2, though the High Court may not be justified in observing that the Arbitrator took undue interest in trying to ascertain the classification of strata, the High Court is well justified in holding that the view taken by the Arbitrator is not at all a reasonably possible view and in fact he ignored one of the relevant clauses, namely, 3.3.4. The Arbitrator was carried away by the fact that chiselling had to be done in view of the hardness of rock. The Arbitrator at the same time did not choose to give a finding that what was encountered by the contractor was something other than laterite rock which is mentioned in the Agreement. As regards the 3rd item, the Arbitrator again ignored the relevant clauses in the agreement and came to the perverse conclusion that the site became restricted on account of certain security measures enforced in the area. The award of sum vis--vis this item is clearly outside the terms of contract. The High Court, therefore, rightly set aside the award on this aspect.\n",
      "Paragraph 131: On the discussions in the foregoing paragraphs the appeals arising from S.L.P. Nos.10526-27 of 2000 filed by the contractor are allowed in part to the extent noted earlier and the appeals arising from S.L.P. Nos.880-881 of 2001 filed by Union of India & another are dismissed.\n",
      "Paragraph 132: There will, however, be no order for costs.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: \n"

      "Paragraph 1: BACKGROUND FACTS:\n",
      "Paragraph 2: 'Nilgiris' is a hill district in the State of Tamil Nadu. Mettupalayam is a small town situate in Nilgiris.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: The villagers of the surrounding villages for their livelihood depend on growing of vegetables and tea. With a view to see that the small vegetable growers are not exploited by the vegetable merchants, a society known as 'Nilgiris Cooperative Marketing Society Limited' (Society for short) was formed as far back as in 1935 with only 116 members.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: The Society, however, grew in course of time and at present it has about 22000 members. The memberships of the Society are of two categories. In the first category only the vegetable or food growers, agricultural cooperative credit societies and agricultural improvement societies are A-class members having voting rights; whereas traders, commission agents and merchants dealing in the commodities grown by the agriculturists are classified as B-class members. They have no right to vote or participate in the management of the Society. The B-class members only, however, are entitled to take part in auctions held in the marketing yards of the Society. Any dispute between the seller member and the purchaser member is resolved through arbitration in terms of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1961.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: The land holdings of the members of the society varies from 1/4th acre to five acres averaging two acres per member. They mainly depend on the rainfall as irrigational facilities are not available. The small farmers are economically weak and have no holding power. Many of them have to take loans for their subsistence, when the weather is not good. Many of them are illiterate. The vegetables produced from their lands being subjected to the vagaries of the weather, the merchants with a view to pressurize them either used to force them to sell that at a very low price or would make them wait for days so that the vegetables become useless. The majority of the members belong to 'Badaga' community which had been declared to be a backward class by the Government of Tamil Nadu. Mettupalayam is a centre for potatoes and vegetables trade.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: The Society has two big marketing yards at Mettupalayam. In the said yards, auction of vegetables takes place. Infrastructure therefor such as offices, godowns yards, weighing machines etc. are provided by the Society. There are two separate yards with pucca godowns, one for potatoes and another for vegetables. The primary members of the Society bring their agricultural produce to the yards by hired lorries or trucks. They remain present till the agricultural produce brought by them is auction- sold and they receive the sale price. The number of primary members visiting the marketing yards of the Society, depending upon the season varies from 100 to 200 members per day. The number of merchants coming to purchase these commodities also varies from 30 to 100. The Society provides for accommodation to the members on a nominal rent.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: It also provides dormitory type of accommodation free of charge. The months of July to October of year are said to be a peak season. Whereas during the peak season about 100 lorries arrive everyday; during the 'off season' average number of lorries arriving at the yard would be around 10.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: For the purpose of bringing potatoes gunny bags are supplied by the Society free of cost.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: The following main jobs are carried out in the said premises:\n",
      "Paragraph 10: i) unloading of the gunny bags containing potatoes from the lorries;\n",
      "Paragraph 11: ii) unpacking the gunny bags and keeping the potatoes in lots inside the godown;\n",
      "Paragraph 12: iii) grading the potatoes into different sorts;\n",
      "Paragraph 13: iv) weighing the auctioned potatoes in 45 kgs.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: and packing them into gunny bags brought by the merchants;\n",
      "Paragraph 15: v) stitching the gunny bags and loading them into lorries hired by the merchants.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: Throughout the process, lots brought by the primary members are kept separate with clear demarcation as regard the ownership theref. Sometimes small farmers unload the bags of potatoes themselves; some of them bring their potatoes upon proper grading in their farms and place it in the yard in a sorted condition. However, if proper grading is not done by the vegetable growers, they are graded into the different sorts.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: The number of persons undertaking the job varies depending upon the quantum of work.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Admittedly an industrial dispute was raised by 407 persons; of whom 73 are potters and 335 are graders. The job of unloading, unpacking of gunny bags, stitching the gunny bags and putting them into lorries are done by porters whereas gradation of potatoes, weighing the auctioned potatoes in 45 kgs. and packing them into gunny bags are done by graders. Most of them are women.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: It is stated that the members of the Society or their authorized representatives remain present throughout the auction. The auction is confirmed only with the consent of the members. The member has a right to decline to sell his produce, if he is not satisfied with the highest rate offered by the merchants and is entitled to hold over the same till the next auction takes place.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: The Society contends that for doing various items of work in the yards, services of certain third parties are made available to the members. They are always available in the yards and any member whether producer or merchant may engage them. The work is done through the workers of the concerned third parties. Payment therefor is to be made by the persons engaging them to the said third parties (contractors). However, sometimes as the producer members may not have enough money with them, the Society makes the payment on their behalf by way of advance, wherefor allegedly written authority is obtained. The Society further contends that the farmers and merchants are at liberty to engage their own men for doing these items of work and some of them do the work themselves. There is no obligation on the part of the member to bring his produce to the Society's yards. He is free to sell is produce in any manner thought it.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: It is not in dispute that the Society does not maintain any attendance register or wages register. The third parties are free to engage men of their own choice and no working hours are fixed or insisted. Any person normally doing the job may come on any day to work. The third parties engage more number of persons during peak season and during lean season less number of persons are engaged. The porters and graders may take up any other job.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES:\n",
      "Paragraph 23: The appellant-Union, however, on or about 19.4. 1982 served a charter of demands upon the Society claiming, inter alia, permanency in service and other benefits. A strike notice was also given wherefor a conciliation proceeding was initiated. The Society thereafter filed a suit being O.S.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: No.2293 of 1982. A writ petition was filed before this Court being W.P. No.23 of 1983 praying for minimum facilities like drinking water, toilet, rest-room, maternity benefits etc. The Society is said to have declared a lock out and a conciliation proceeding thereupon started again.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: The writ petition was thereafter withdrawn. The conciliation proceeding ended in a failure.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: REFERENCE:\n",
      "Paragraph 27: On or about 19.5.1984, the State of Tamil Nadu issued a notification in exercise of its power under Section 10(1)(d) of the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] referring the following disputes for adjudication of the Industrial Tribunal :\n",
      "Paragraph 28: \"i) Whether the non-employment of the workmen referred in the reference is justified ? ii) To what relief ?\" PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL:\n",
      "Paragraph 29: In the aforementioned industrial reference before the Tribunal, witnesses were examined on behalf of the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: Documents were also produced. By reason of an award dated 5.9.1989, the Tribunal opined that there did not exist any relationship of employer and employee between the Society and the concerned persons, observing :\n",
      "Paragraph 31: \"36. In view of the above finding, if we approach this case, there is no convincing evidence placed by the petitioner to establish the master and servant relationship to hold that the persons referred in this dispute are only workmen of the Respondent-Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 37\\. Viewed from any angle, either on facts or on law, the petitioner-Union has not substantiated that the persons mentioned in the Annexure are workmen and therefore their non-employment is not justified. Hence this point is found against the Petitioner Union.\" On the said findings the reference was rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE HIGH COURT:\n",
      "Paragraph 34: Aggrieved thereby the appellant preferred a writ petition before the High Court marked as Writ Petition No.14659 of 1989.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: During the pendency of the said proceeding, other disputes also ensued resulting in closure of the yards;\n",
      "Paragraph 36: whereafter, again conciliation proceedings were initiated on or about 3.8.1985. The respondent-Society issued an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper inviting tenders for operations. Questioning the said action on the part of the Society, a writ petition was filed in the Madras High Court which was marked as W.P. No.9333 of 1985 praying therein for issuance of writ of mandamus directing the State to prohibit introduction of contract labour system in the Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: Another writ petition being W.P. No.9334 of 1985 was also filed wherein the petitioners prayed for issuance of a writ of or in the nature of mandamus directing the Society not to engage contract labour purported to be on the ground that the same is contrary to Sections 25-O and 25-T of the [Industrial Disputes Act] and Sections 7 and 12 of the [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970].\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Certain interim orders were passed by the High Court and some appeals were also filed and the matter came up before this Court also, being Civil Appeal No.5381 of 1985 on or about 26.9.1986 wherein this Court passed the following order :\n",
      "Paragraph 39: \"On behalf of the Marketing Society, Dr. Y.S. Chitale, learned Counsel assures us that hereafter workmen will not be permitted to be employed by contractors to work within the yard of the Society. He also assures us that the 407 workers previously employed may come back and work in the yard without any objection. It is open to any worker to go and seek employment, but contractors will be excluded. The case now pending before Industrial Tribunal may be disposed of expeditiously. Civil Misc. Petition is disposed of accordingly.\" By another interim order passed in Writ Petition No.19310 and 19311 of 1986, a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court directed :\n",
      "Paragraph 40: \"The third respondent shall give employment directly to all the 407 workers. If, after providing employment to these 407 workers, any more lands are required, then the management is free to give employment to such of these persons. The Collector of Coimbatore will see to it that the order of the Supreme Court extracted above is implemented in its true spirit.\" In an appeal carried out by the Society being W.A. No.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 1372 of 1986, the High Court of Madras issued the following directions :\n",
      "Paragraph 42: \"Apparently it appears to us that the order made by the learned single Judge runs counter to the order of the Supreme Court dated 4.12.1985. Therefore, the order of the learned Single Judge is stayed. Since the order which is in controversy is that of the Supreme Court, this is eminently a fit case where the parties are at liberty to get necessary clarification from the Supreme Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: Till the order is clarified by the Supreme Court, if the parties approach the Supreme Court for this, the appellant will implement the order dated 4.12.1985 by way of an interim arrangement.\" On an application, this Court by an order dated 13.4.1987, observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 44: \"The interim arrangement will continue till disposal of the writ petition in the High Court. Meanwhile the trial of the industrial dispute will be stayed.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: No order on the application for impleading party. All the CMPs are disposed of accordingly.\" Another interim order was passed on 29.8.1988 in Writ Petition NO.9334 of 1985 in the following terms :\n",
      "Paragraph 46: \"In the result, the 3rd respondent is directed to give employment directly to all the 407 workers and pay the wages directly to them as per the order of the Supreme Court dated 4.12.1988. This petition is ordered accordingly.\" On an appeal preferred by the Society before a Division Bench marked as W.A. No.1261 of 1988, it was directed :\n",
      "Paragraph 47: \"To give quietus to the controversy in the writ petition, we direct that W.P.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 9334/85 along with the connected writ petition viz. W.P. No.9333/85 be listed for final hearing on 26.10.1988 at the top of the list before the learned Single Judge, who hears the date-fixed writ petitions.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 49: All the three writ petitions came up for hearing before a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court. The said writ petitions were dismissed observing :\n",
      "Paragraph 50: \"The writ petitions are liable to be dismissed. However, having regard to the fact that the petitioner has made an application to the State Government as early as on 9.8.1985 as seen from paragraph 13 of the affidavit to prohibit the employment of contract labour under section 10 of the Act for loading, unloading and other activities of the 3rd respondent society, a reference to the counter affidavit filed by the government is necessary.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: Paragraphs 12 and 13 of the counter affidavit are extracted :\n",
      "Paragraph 52: \"It submit that the averments in paragraph 13 are not correct. The Union has applied to the State Advisory Contract Labour Board to issue directions to the Management prohibiting the employment of contract labour under Sec.10 of the Act. I submit that after consultation with State Advisory Contract Labour Board the Government will take a decision in this matter.\" This counter affidavit has been sworn to on 5th December, 1986. Even though there was no order pending these W.Ps.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: Prohibiting the Government from passing orders under Sec. 10 of the Act, the Government has not taken any action in spite of the averments contained in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the counter affidavits. It is for the Government to pass orders under Sec. 10 of the Act as expeditiously as possible, one way or other.\" Three letters patent appeals were preferred by the appellant herein being aggrieved by and dissatisfied therewith. By reason of the impugned judgment the said appeals were dismissed.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: The appellant is, thus, before us in these appeals.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: Civil Appeal No.1351-52 arise out of Writ Petition No.109 and 110 of 1989 wherein certain interim orders were passed.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: Civil Appeal No.1353 of 2001 is the main appeal which arises out of an award of the Industrial Tribunal.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: SUBMISSIONS:\n",
      "Paragraph 58: Mr. N.G.R. Prasad, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would take us through the evidences adduced by the parties both oral and documentary as also the findings of the Industrial Tribunal and would submit that it and consequently the High Court committed a manifest error:\n",
      "Paragraph 59: (i) in passing the impugned award insofar as they failed to apply the 'organisation test' in the light of the decisions of this court;\n",
      "Paragraph 60: (ii) despite having arrived at the conclusion that the respondents society exercises supervision and control over the concerned workmen, in concluding that such supervision and control were not on its own behalf but on behalf of its members;\n",
      "Paragraph 61: (iii) in arriving at the finding that as the society does not carry out any manufacturing activities;\n",
      "Paragraph 62: it is not industry, inasmuch as supply of the services by an organisation would also give rise to formation of relationship of an employer and employees.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: Elaborating his submissions, Mr. Prasad would contend that it is not in dispute that the 407 workmen had been working in the market yard on a daily wage basis and although they are said to have been employed by the third parties but indisputably, the society pays wages to them although the same is said to be reimbursed by the members of the society. It was pointed out that the dispute between the members and members are resolved by the society and furthermore as the concerned persons have been given token and are given gifts during festival season, would lead to an irresistible inference that the concerned workmen are employees of the society.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: Mr. Prasad would argue that the principal question which was required to be asked was for whom do the workmen work and to whom they look up for their wages. It was submitted that the relationship between the Society and the workmen was required to be determined having regard to the following fact:\n",
      "Paragraph 65: (i) work is being carried out in the premises belonging to the society;\n",
      "Paragraph 66: (ii) wages are paid by the society;\n",
      "Paragraph 67: (iii) from Ex. W7 and W8, it would appear, that the society exercises control over the workmen;\n",
      "Paragraph 68: (iv) on festival occasions, the workmen look to the society for gift.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: It was contended that the Tribunal and the High Court overlooked the evidences on record as regard nature of the job performed by the workmen as has been admitted by MW1 and furthermore no finding has been arrived at to the effect that the so-called third parties are contractors.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: The learned counsel would submit that the Tribunal has committed a manifest error also in holding that only because the society takes commission from its members, it cannot be an employer. It was contended that for determining the question as regard existence of the relationship of employer and employee what is required to be considered is as to whether the concerned workmen are part and parcel of the organisation. Economic reality, the learned counsel would contend, has also some role to play.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: The learned counsel would urge that this Court in a large number of cases lifted the veil so as to come to the conclusion that the engagement of third parties or contractors may be a camouflage and there existed a relationship of employer and employee. Determination of such relationship, Mr. Prasad would aruge, do not depend upon the statutory liability of the employer as even in relation to non-statutory canteens this Court has held that the so-called workmen of the contractors are in effect and substance the workmen of the principal employer.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: Mr. Sudarsh Menon, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent society, on the other hand, would submit that the society is a service society and having regard to the fact that the members are both growers and merchants and as the porters and the graders are appointed by both growers and merchants independently, it cannot be said that the society is the employer of the concerned workmen. The learned counsel would contend that the Industrial Tribunal, the learned Single Judge as also the Division Bench of the High Court having arrived at a finding of fact that there does not exist any relationship of employer and employee, this Court should not interfere therewith.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: DETERMINATION OF RELATIONSHIP:\n",
      "Paragraph 74: Determination of the vexed questions as to whether a contract is a contract of service or contract for service and whether the concerned employees are employees of the contractors has never been an easy task. No decision of this Court has laid down any hard and fast rule nor it is possible to do so. The question in each case has to be answered having regard to the fact involved therein. No single test - be it control test, be it organisation or any other test - has been held to be the determinative factor for determining the jural relationship of employer and employee.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: There are cases arising on the borderline between what is clearly an employer- employee relation and what is clearly the independent entrepreneurial dealing.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: TESTS:\n",
      "Paragraph 77: [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] observed that supervision and control test is the prima facie test for determining the relationship of employment. The nature or extent of control required to establish such relationship would vary from business to business and, thus, cannot be given a precise definition. The nature of business for the said purpose is also a relevant factor. Instances are galore there where having regard to conflict in decisions in relation to the similar set of facts, the Parliament has to intervene as, for example, in the case of workers rolling bidis.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: In a given case it may not be possible to infer that a relationship of employer and employee has come into being only because some persons had been more or less continuously working in a particular premises inasmuch as even in relation thereto the actual nature of work done by them coupled with other circumstances would have a role to play.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: [?CITATION?], this Court said that it is a question of fact in each case whether the relationship of master and servant exists between the management and the workmen and there is no abstract a priori test of the work control required for establishing the control of service. A brief resume of the development of law in this point was necessary only for the purpose of showing that it would not be prudent to search for a formula in the nature of a single test for determining the vexed question.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: RELEVANT FACTORS:\n",
      "Paragraph 81: The control test and the organization test, therefore, are not the only factors which can be said to decisive.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: With a view of elicit the answer, the court is required to consider several factors which would have a bearing on the result : (a) who is appointing authority; (b) who is the pay master; (c) who can dismiss; (d) how long alternative service lasts; e) the extent of control and supervision; (f) the nature of the job, e.g. whether, it is professional or skilled work; (g) nature of establishment; (h) the right to reject.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: With a view to find out reasonable solution in a problematic case of this nature, what is needed is an integrated approach meaning thereby integration of the relevant tests wherefor it may be necessary to examine as to whether the workman concerned was fully integrated into the employer's concern meaning thereby independent of the concern although attached therewith to some extent.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: I.T. Smith and J.C. Wood in 'Industrial Law', third edition, at page 8-10 stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 85: \"In spite of the obvious importance of the distinction between an employee and an independent contractor, the tests to be applied are vague and may, in a borderline case, be difficult to apply.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: Historically, the solution lay in applying the 'control' test, i.e., could the employer control not just what the person was to do, but also the manner of this doing it - if so, that person was his employee. In the context in which it mainly arose in the nineteenth century, of domestic, agricultural and manual workers, this test had much to commend it, but with the increase sophistication of industrial processes and the greater numbers of professional and skilled people being in salaried employment, it soon became obvious that the test was insufficient (for example in the case of a doctor, architect, skilled engineer, pilot, etc.) and so, despite certain attempts to modernise it, it is now accepted that in itself control is no longer the sole test, though it does remain a factor and perhaps, in some cases, a decisive one.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: In the search for a substitute test, ideas have been put forward of an 'integration' test, i.e. whether the person was fully integrated into the employer's concern, or remained apart from and independent of it. Once again, this is not now viewed as a sufficient test in itself, but rather as a potential factor (which may be useful in allowing a court to take a wider and more realistic view). The modern approach has been to abandon the search for a single test, and instead to take a multiple or 'pragmatic' approach, weighing upon all the factors for and against a contract of employment and determining on which side the scales eventually settle. Factors which are usually of importance are as follows - the power to select and dismiss, the direct payment of some form of remuneration, deduction of PAYE and national insurance contributions, the organisation of the workplace, the supply of tools and materials (though there can still be a labour-only sub- contract) and the economic realities (in particular who bears the risk of loss and has the chance of profit and whether the employee could be said to be 'in business on his own account'). A further development in the recent case law (particularly concerning atypical employments) has been the idea of 'mutuality of obligations' as a possible factor, i.e. whether the course of dealings between the parties demonstrates sufficient such mutuality for there to be an overall employment relationship.\" [?CITATION?]. [?CITATION?], Lord Porter pointed out:\n",
      "Paragraph 88: \"Many factors have a bearing on the result. Who is paymaster, who can dismiss, how long the alternative service lasts, what machinery is employed, have all to be kept in mind.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: The expressions used in any individual case must always be considered in regard to the subject-matter under discussion but amongst the many tests suggested I think that the most satisfactory, by which to ascertain who is the employer at any particular time is to ask who is entitled to tell the employee the way in which he is to do the work upon which he is engaged.\" If the provisions of the contract as a whole are inconsistent with its being a contract of service, it will be some other kind of contract and the person doing the work will not be a servant. (See Ready Mixed Concrete [?CITATION?]) The decisions of this Court lead to one conclusion that law in this behalf is not static. In [?CITATION?], Krishna Iyer, J. observed \"to crystalise criteria conclusively is baffling but broad indications may be available from decisions\".\n",
      "Paragraph 90: The case at hand, as noticed hereinbefore, poses intricate question having regard to the facts and circumstance of the case.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: In our endevour to find out an answer, let us at the first instance look at the object of the Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: SOCIETY:\n",
      "Paragraph 93: The Society had a humble beginning but it had a laudable object, as would appear from its bye-laws. The objects of the Society are stated as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 94: \"a) To encourage self help, thrift and cooperation among members;\n",

      "Paragraph 108: \"That the Board of Directors may arrange for the sale of produce of members and members of affiliated cooperative societies pledged to or deposited with the society and disburse sale proceeds to them immediately after such lots are sold. In arranging for the sale they shall act only as the agent of the members and members of affiliated cooperative societies concerned and shall not do the business as owner on behalf of the society. Any loss arising out of the business shall be borne by the members of the affiliated cooperative societies concerned and not by the society.\" It is not in dispute that the Society is not a trading society. It cannot buy or sell the agricultural produce or the fruits except in a case where the proviso appended to bye-law 34 is attracted which is in the following terms :\n",
      "Paragraph 109: \"When the society enters into a contract with the Government of Military Department of cooperative institutes or with any firm which has entered into a contract with the Government or military department for supply of produce, the Board may purchase the produce outright whenever necessary and sell it as owner on behalf of the society.\" BURDEN OF PROOF:\n",
      "Paragraph 110: It is a well-settled principle of law that the person who sets up a plea of existence of relationship of employer and employee, the burden would be upon him.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: [?CITATION?], the Kerala High Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 112: \"The burden of proof being on the workmen to establish the employer- employee relationship an adverse inference cannot be drawn against the employer that if he were to produce books of accounts they would have proved employer-employee relationship.\" [?CITATION?] it has been held:\n",
      "Paragraph 113: \"Where a person asserts that he was a workmen of the Company, and it is denied by the Company, it is for him to prove the fact. It is not for the Company to prove that he was not an employee of the Company but of some other person.\" The question whether the relationship between the parties is one of the employer and employee is a pure question of fact and ordinarily the High Court while exercising its power of judicial review shall not interfere therewith unless the finding is manifestly or obviously erroneous or perverse.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: APPLICATION OF LAW IN THE PRESENT CASE:\n",
      "Paragraph 115: Having regard to the materials on records, we may at the outset notice the findings of the Industrial Tribunal which are : (1) having regard to the object of the Society, there is no need to employ labourers far less giving continuous employment to them. Exs.W-7, W-8 and W-12 do not show that superintendence control in respect of grading, weighing etc. is absolute. The memo. dated 27.8.1982 appears to have been issued having regard to a complaint made by traders who participate in the auction to the effect that the staff are not showing proper care in grading, weighing and stacking the goods in the Society and they have to purchase the under-quality and under-weight vegetables resulting in continuous loss to them. It is in that situation a direction was issued. A further complain was made that the Society employs small boys in grading, weighing and stacking of goods. In that situation the Godown Assistants were directed to see that no person who is less than 18 years is engaged for unloading, grading and stacking of cabbage and the workmen should be classified into two groups, one for unloading and another for grading, weighing and stacking.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: The Tribunal in this behalf observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 117: \"...Incidentally it is also significant to note that the society has been formed to protect the interest of the members.\n",
      "Paragraph 118: The society cannot keep quiet by stating it is the contractors job and it has no responsibility. In my opinion nothing is wrong in issuing the circular Ex.W-8, only to pull up the irresponsible of the staff and other workers. Therefore it would not amount to that the Respondent- Society has exercised its powers on their own workers and therefore they are employees.\" Although in the said letter, the word 'workmen' of the Society had been used, in all probability, the said expression had been used loosely. The Office Order dated 22.8.1963 provides for the job assigned to their regular staff.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: The job of the Marketing Supervisor is as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 120: \"7. Marketing supervisor :\n",
      "Paragraph 121: He should attend to the speedy disposal of the potato stocks of the members to their best advantage. He *should see that all the stocks purchased by the Merchants are taken delivery of without delay. He should control the staff working in the potato godowns and see that no complaints are received from members and merchants etc., regarding purchase or sale of potatoes. He should supervise grading, weighing and packing of potatoes promptly and properly.\" The job of the Marketing Supervisor, therefore, do not show that complete control and supervision is upon the society. The Marketing Supervisor was allotted the job to see that the work is carried out smoothly so that neither the purchaser members nor the merchant members are put to any disadvantage.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: Having regard to the interest of the farmers as also the merchants, the Marketing Supervisor was asked to supervise grading, weighing and packing of potatoes promptly and properly.\n",
      "Paragraph 123: The purported decision of the Society to give certain benefits to the workmen too is not decisive as the same had become a conciliation proceeding. The said conciliation proceeding, as noticed hereinbefore, had to be initiated having regard to the consequence upon a strike notice given by the workmen which could be averted due to conciliatory efforts. It would appear from the same that the conciliation efforts were made by the concerned Conciliation Officer. However, despite conciliation, graders and porters went on strike on 19.10.1982 whereafter again a conciliation proceeding was held pursuant whereto or in furtherance whereof certain advises and suggestions had been given by the conciliation officer based on agreement between the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 124: The finding of the Tribunal in respect of Ex.W-12 is in the following terms :\n",
      "Paragraph 125: \"...Even under Ex.W-12 it has been stated to pay the festival advance to the graders through the representatives.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: Therefore it cannot be said they have been asked to pay directly the festival advance amount. That apart, it is relevant to note at this stage that this document has not been signed by any party. Considering these above facts and mianly taking into account the object of the society coupled with the duties envisaged under Clause 34 under Ex.M-22 bye-laws, it is impossible to come to a conclusion that the society has exercised these powers under Ex.W-7, Ex.W-8 and Ex.W-12 as an employer...\" The Tribunal has further come to the conclusion that token number had been given to the porters during emergency to save them from police harassment and no such token was issued after cessation of emergency.\n",
      "Paragraph 127: It is true, as contended by Mr. Prasad, that the Tribunal sought to distinguish certain cases relied upon by the learned counsel for the parties holding that in those cases, the employers were manufacturing units and were doing regular work but the observation of the Tribunal must be understood having regard to the totality of the circumstances as it has observed that in such cases employers being manufacturing units and were doing regular work and the nature of business was such which required continuous supervision and furthermore the workmen who were required to work on fixed hours which was not the case in the present one.\n",
      "Paragraph 128: The learned Tribunal has further found that the volume of job as also the number of persons working depend upon the season inasmuch in the peak season a large number of persons would be appointed whereas in the off season the number of appointments would be less. The Tribunal had further held that the Society acts as a commission agent. The submission of Mr. Prasad to the effect that the Tribunal has ignored the question of employment of contractor, some of whom may be under a legal incapacity to do so but the same again would not be decisive. Furthermore, even in terms of Section 21 of the [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act], the principal employer has a statutory obligation to see that the concerned employees are paid their wages and deduct the same from the bills of the contractors. It has also come on records that the remuneration paid by the Society on behalf of its members are done through Maistry and not directly to the concerned workers. We have noticed hereinbefore in details the nature of the services rendered by the Society to the different categories of its members, as also the right of the members to approach the third parties to take the services of the workmen working under them for unloading, grading and loading.\n",
      "Paragraph 129: In nutshell, the following can be deduced :\n",
      "Paragraph 130: 1\\. Growers and merchants are free to engage their own porters and graders or can do the work by themselves. There is, thus, no obligation on the societies godown or engage service of the workers, waiting in the yard.\n",
      "Paragraph 131: 2\\. No attendance registers or wage registers are maintained in respect of graders and porters.\n",
      "Paragraph 132: 3\\. The society has no control as who should do the work and the members are free to engage any worker available in the yard.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: 4\\. No working hours are fixed for porters and graders. They are free to come and go at will.\n",
      "Paragraph 134: 5\\. The workmen have no obligation to report to work everyday.\n",
      "Paragraph 135: 6\\. Society has no control regarding the number of workers to be engaged and the work to be turned out by the porters and graders.\n",
      "Paragraph 136: 7\\. No appointment order is issued by the society.\n",
      "Paragraph 137: 8\\. No disciplinary control over the porters and graders is exercised by the Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 138: 9\\. Total supervision or control is not exercised by the Society over the work done by porters or graders.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: 10\\. Porters and graders can go for other work and there is no obligation to work only in the yards.\n",
      "Paragraph 140: 11\\. Payment is normally made to a worker by the member. No direct payment is made to workers by the society. The society makes payment only on the authorization on behalf of that member.\n",
      "Paragraph 141: 12\\. Under the price guarantee scheme introduced by the society if the prices offered by the merchants are not acceptable to the members then the society guarantees the minimum price. If the produce sold by the society fetches more than the minimum guaranteed price excess is passed on to the member, if the price is less than the minimum price, the loss therefor is borne by the society.\n",
      "Paragraph 142: 13\\. Porters and graders also work under the supervision of members and merchants.\n",
      "Paragraph 143: Amounts paid by the society to a worker/authorized by a member is distributed by him to other workmen and the Society is not concerned with the number of workers engaged and amounts distributed to them.\n",
      "Paragraph 144: The farmers themselves are indigent persons. It is not a case where the concerned workmen are without any master.\n",
      "Paragraph 145: The third parties employ and pay them their salary or wages invariably. They have the right to appoint or not to appoint and the little amount of supervision made by the officers of the Society are for the purpose of overseeing the smooth transactions and not for its own benefit. The contract is entered into by different parties for different purposes. The services of the workmen by the farmers or traders may or may not be taken. There may be disputes between one class of members with the other which incidentally may have some bearing on the performance of job by the concerned workmen.\n",
      "Paragraph 146: We may further notice that the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents has drawn our attention to the statements made in the counter affidavit to the effect that the President of Petitioner Association runs the biggest private mundy in Mettupalayam and adopts the same procedure of engaging workers and the job of unloading, cleaning, sorting, grading etc. is done by the Respondent society. It has further been stated that there are about 60 such private mundies at Mettupalayam and although every mundy adopts the same pattern of engaging workers but except in the case of the respondent no industrial dispute had been raised in respect of any other mundy.\n",
      "Paragraph 147: EMPLOYMENT AND NON-EMPLOYMENT :\n",
      "Paragraph 148: Employment and non-employment indisputably is a matter which is specified in the Second and the Third Schedules of the [Industrial Disputes Act]. The concept of employment involves three ingredients, which are : (i) Employer - one who employs, i.e. engages the services of other persons;\n",
      "Paragraph 149: (ii) Employee - one who works for another for hire; and (iii) Contract of employment - the contract of service between the employer and the employee whereunder the employee agrees to serve the employer subject to his control and supervision. On the other hand, non-employment being negative of the expression \"employment\" would ordinarily mean a dispute when the workmen is out of service. When non-employment is referable to an employment which at one point of time was existing would be a matter required to be dealt with differently than a situation where non-employment would mean a contemplated employment.\n",
      "Paragraph 150: The question of non-employment in the later category would arise only when the employer refuses to give work to a person who pleads and proves to the satisfaction of the management that he was entitled thereto. However, the dispute regarding the refusal to employ the persons who were promised to be employed is not connected with the employment or non-employment within the meaning of Section 2(k) of the Act. (See [?CITATION?]) The reference made by the State of Tamil Nadu was absolutely vague. The very fact that reference suggests that the workmen are not being employed by the Society is itself a pointer to the fact that it is not the case where the State Government has proceeded on the basis that there existed such a relationship. Save and except in certain situations, as for example when there exists a provision in the standing order certified under [Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946] or a memorandum of settlement require the employer to employ certain persons, directions ordinarily cannot be issued by the Tribunal directing the employer to give employment.\n",
      "Paragraph 151: CAMOUFLAGE:\n",
      "Paragraph 152: Whether a contract is a sham or camouflage is not a question of law which can be arrived at having regard to the provisions of [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970]. It is for the industrial adjudicator to decide the said question keeping in view the evidences brought on records.\n",
      "Paragraph 153: [?CITATION?], non- maintenance of records by the contractors was held to be not conclusive for determination as to whether the workmen were working under the contractor. The Court held that such disputed questions of fact cannot be gone into in a civil proceeding.\n",
      "Paragraph 154: In [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 155: \"...A jurisdictional fact is one on the existence or otherwise of which depends assumption or refusal to assume jurisdiction by a court, tribunal or the authority. Said fact has to be established and its existence proved before a Court under the Maharashtra Act can assume jurisdiction of a particular case. If the complaint is made prima facie accepting existence of the contractor in such a case what has to be first established is whether the arrangement or agreement between the complainant and the contractor is sham or bogus. There is an inherence admission in such a situation that patently the arrangement is between the complainant and the contractor and the claim for a new and different relationship itself is a disputed fact.\n",
      "Paragraph 156: To put it differently, the complainant seeks for a declaration that such arrangement is not a real one but something which is a fagade. There is no direct agreement between the complainant and the principal employer and one such is sought to be claimed but not substantiated in accordance with law. The relief in a sense relates to a legal assumption that the hidden agreement or arrangement has to be surfaced...\" It was also observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 157: \"The common thread passing through all these judgments is that the threshold question to be decided is whether the industrial dispute could be raised for abolition of the contractor labour system in view of the provisions of the Maharashtra Act. What happens to an employee engaged by the contractor if the contract made is abolished is not really involved in the dispute. There can be no quarrel with the proposition as contended by the appellants that the jurisdiction to decide a matter would essentially depend upon pleadings in the plaint. But in a case like the present one, where the fundamental fact decides the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint itself the position would be slightly different. In order to entertain a complaint under the Maharashtra Act, it has to be established that the claimant was an employee of the employer against whom complaint is made, under the ID Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 158: When there is no dispute about such relationship, as noted in paragraph 9 of CIPLA's case (supra) the Maharashtra Act would have full application. When that basic claim is disputed obviously the issue has to be adjudicated by the forum which is competent to adjudicate...\" CASE LAWS :\n",
      "Paragraph 159: In the aforementioned backdrop, let us take note of certain decisions operating in the field vis-`-vis the factual matrix obtaining therein.\n",
      "Paragraph 160: [?CITATION?] is a case which involved workers who used to take leaves home for cutting them in proper shape. However, the actual rolling by filling the leaves with tobacco took place in places what were called contractors' factories. The bidis so rolled would be delivered to the appellant and nobody-else.\n",
      "Paragraph 161: The price of the raw-material as also the finished product would remain the same as fixed by the appellant therein.\n",
      "Paragraph 162: This Court having regard to the materials on records arrived at a finding of fact that the intermediaries were mere agents or branch managers appointed by the management and the relationship of employer and employee subsisted between the appellant and the bidis rollers, inter alia, on the ground that the so- called independent contractors served no particular duties and discharged no special functions and had no independence at all. They were impecunious persons who could hardly afford to have any factory of their own and in fact some of them were ex-employees of the appellant.\n",
      "Paragraph 163: In [?CITATION?], the job required to be performed was skilled and professional in nature. Mathew, J. speaking for the Bench observed that the test of right to control the manner of doing the work as traditionally formulated cannot be treated as an exclusive test. The court applied organization test in the fact situation obtaining therein laying importance on the fact that the employer provides the equipment and stating that where a person hires out a piece of work to an independent contractor, he expects the contractor to provided all the necessary tools and equipments, whereas if he employs a servant he expects to provide the same himself.\n",
      "Paragraph 164: The supply of machine was highlighted having regard to that fact that the sewing machine on which the workers do the work generally belong to the employer is an important consideration for deciding the relationship of master and servant. Besides the same the right of the employer to reject the end product and directing the worker to restitch it also led this court to conclude that the element of control and supervision was also present.\n",
      "Paragraph 165: However, in a slightly different fact situation where a person working as a part-time accountant for a long number of years who used to look after his own partnership business after working hours, was held to be not a workman. (See (Ker.)) In [?CITATION?], payments used to be made to the workmen on piece- rates in a big tailoring establishment. Desai, J. in the facts and circumstances of the case observed that right of removal of the workmen or not to give the work had the element of control and supervision which had been amply satisfied in that case.\n",
      "Paragraph 166: The question which arose for consideration was as to whether only because the concerned workman was paid on piece rate was itself indicative of the fact that there existed a relationship of principal employer and independent contractor.\n",
      "Paragraph 167: It is, however, relevant to note that therein also an observation was made to the effect that the method of payment in various occupations is different in different industries.\n",
      "Paragraph 168: In [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 169: \"The standards and nature of tests to be applied for finding out the existence of master and servant relationship cannot be confined to or concretized into fixed formula(e) for universal application, invariably in all class or category of cases. Though some common standards can be devised, the mere availability of any one or more or their absence in a given case cannot by itself be held to be decisive of the whole issue, since it may depend upon each case to case and the peculiar device adopted by the employer to get his needs fulfilled without rendering him liable.\n",
      "Paragraph 170: That being the position, in order to safeguard the welfare of the workmen, the veil may have to be pierced to get at the realities. Therefore, it would be not only impossible but also not desirable to lay down abstract principles or rules to serve as a ready reckoner for all situations and thereby attempt to compartmentalize and peg them into any pigeonhole formulae, to be insisted upon as proof of such relationship. This would only help to perpetuate practicing unfair labour practices than rendering substantial justice to the class of persons who are invariably exploited on account of their inability to dictate terms relating to conditions of their service. Neither all the tests nor guidelines indicated as having been followed in the decisions noticed above should be invariably insisted upon in every case, nor the mere absence of any one of such criteria could be held to be decisive of the matter. A cumulative consideration of a few or more of them, by themselves or in combination with any other relevant aspects, may also serve to be a safe and effective method to ultimately decide this often agitated question. Expecting similarity or identity of facts in all such variety or class of cases involving different type of establishments and in dealing with different employers would mean seeking for things, which are only impossible to find.\" Having regard to the fact that therein a cooperative canteen was promoted with the consent of the management by serving members of the Bank staff, which was running within the bank's premises and with the funds, subsidy and infrastructural facilities provided exclusively by the Bank, it was held that there existed a relationship of master and servant.\n",
      "Paragraph 171: However, we may notice that almost in a similar situation in Employers in relation to the [?CITATION?], it was held that in the absence of statutory or other legal obligations and in the absence of any right in the Bank to supervise and control the work or details there in any manner regarding the canteen workers employed in the three types of canteens, it cannot be said that relationship of master and servant existed between the Bank and the various persons employed in the three types of canteens and in that situation, the demand for regularization was considered to be unsustainable.\n",
      "Paragraph 172: In our opinion, the statutory canteen or other canteen run by the employer in his premises stands absolutely on a different footing. In determining the relationship of employer and employee, as has been noticed by this Court in [?CITATION?], the said question has no relevance.\n",
      "Paragraph 173: In [?CITATION?], as the appellants were required by the Factories Act to provide canteen facilities and since the workers engaged through the contractors had been held to be the employees of the principal employers, this Court held that the workers engaged through contractors were entitled for regularization of their services.\n",
      "Paragraph 174: Although we have reservation about the correctness or otherwise of the said decision but we need not go into the said question inasmuch even therein, the court noticed that the decision in Steel Authority of India Ltd. (supra) stands on a different footing.\n",
      "Paragraph 175: In [?CITATION?], the question which arose for consideration was as to whether the deposit collectors who received commission is in reality a wage which would depend on the productivity. Such commission was paid for promoting the business of the bank. Having regard to the fact that the banks have control over the deposit collectors, they were considered to be their own workers.\n",
      "Paragraph 176: In Indian Banks Association (supra) the reference which was made for adjudication of the Industrial Tribunal was as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 177: \"Whether the demands of the Commission Agents or as the case may be Deposit Collectors employed in the banks listed in the annexure that they are entitled to pay scales, allowances and other service conditions available to regular clerical employees of those banks is justified ? If not, to what relief are the workmen concerned entitled and from which date ?\" Having regard to the evidences both oral and documentary led by the parties, the Tribunal directed :\n",
      "Paragraph 178: \"All those Deposit Collectors and Agents who are below the age of 45 years on 3.10.1980 (the date of the first reference of this industrial dispute) shall be considered for regular absorption for the post of clerks and cashiers if they are matriculates and above including qualified graduates and postgraduates. They may be taken to banks services as regular employees if they pass the qualifying examinations conducted by the banks. Those who are absorbed shall be treated on a par with regular clerical employees of the Bank.\n",
      "Paragraph 179: Those who have qualified 8th class and below matriculation shall be considered for absorption as sub-staff by conducting qualifications examination.\n",
      "Paragraph 180: As regards the Deposit Collectors and Agents who are above 45 years of age on the date 3.10.1980 and also those who are unwilling to be absorbed in regular banks service shall be paid the full back wage of Rs.750.00 per month linked with a minimum deposit of Rs.7500.00 per month and they should be paid incentive remuneration at 2% for collection of over and above 7500.00 per month and they should also pay uniform conveyance of Rs.50 per month for deposit of less than Rs.10,000.00 and Rs.100.00 per month for deposits of more than Rs.10,000.00 up to or above Rs.30,000.00 per month they should be paid gratuity of 15 days' commission for each year of service rendered.\" Thus in that decision, a scheme was formulated.\n",
      "Paragraph 181: However, we may notice that in [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 182: \"...However, persons who are engaged on the basis of individual contracts to work on a commission basis cannot, by the very nature of their engagement, be equated with regular employees doing similar work...\" In [?CITATION?], the concerned workmen were engaged as gardeners to sweep, clean, maintain and look after the lawns and parks inside factory premises and campus of the residential colony of the appellant through the agencies of the Respondent Nos.3 to 5; therein their services were terminated pursuant whereto an industrial dispute was raised before the Tribunal, the employer did not produce any records. Having applied the control test and in view of the fact that the records of the concerned workmen had not been produced, this Court did not interfere with the award of the Tribunal and the judgment of the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 183: In [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 184: \"...The concept of employment involves three ingredients (1) employer (2) employee and (3) the contract of employment. The employer is one who employs, i.e. one who engages the services of other persons. The employee is one who works for another for hire.\n",
      "Paragraph 185: The employment is the contract of service between the employer and the employee whereunder the employee agrees to serve the employer subject to his control and supervision...\" Following the decision of this Court in Shri Chintaman Rao (supra), this Court in [?CITATION?], held:\n",
      "Paragraph 186: \"Employment brings in the contract of service between the employer and the employed. We have mentioned already that in this case there was no agreement or contract of service between the appellant and Pandurang. What can be said at the most is that whenever Pandurang went to work, the appellant agreed to supply him tobacco for rolling bidis and that Pandurang agreed to roll bidis on being paid at a certain rate for the bidis turned out. The appellant exercised no control and supervision over [?CITATION?], this Court upon noticing several authorities held :\n",
      "Paragraph 187: \"The principle which emerges from these authorities is that the prima facie test for the determination of the relationship between master and servant is the existence of the right in the master to supervise and control the work done by the servant not only in the matter of directing what work the servant is to do but also the manner in which he shall do his work, or to borrow the words of Lord Uthwatt at page 23 in [?CITATION?], \"The proper test is whether or not the hirer had authority to control the manner of execution of the act in question\".\n",
      "Paragraph 188: The nature or extent of control which is requisite to establish the relationship of employer and employee must necessarily vary from business to business and is by its very nature incapable of precise definition. As has been noted above, recent pronouncements of the Court of Appeal in England have even expressed the view that it is not necessary for holding that a person is an employee, that the employer should be proved to have exercised control over his work, that the test of control was not one of universal application and that there were many contracts in which the master could not control the manner in which the work was done (Vide observations of Somervell, L.J., in Cassidy v. Ministry of Health (supra), and Denning, L.J., in Stevenson, Jordan and Harrison Ltd. v. MacDonald and Evans (supra).) The correct method of approach, therefore, would be to consider whether having regard to the nature of the work there was due control and supervision by the employer or to use the words of Fletcher Moulton, L.J., at page 549 in[?CITATION?] :- \"In my opinion it is impossible to lay down any rule of law distinguishing the one from the other. It is a question of fact to be decided by all the circumstances of the case. The greater the amount of direct control exercised over the person rendering the services by the person contracting for them the stronger the grounds for holding it to be a contract of service, and similarly the greater the degree of independence of such control the greater the probability that the services rendered are of the nature of professional services and that the contract is not one of service.\" In [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 189: \"...It stands established that Industrial Law revolves on the axis of master and servant relationship and by a catena of precedents it stands established that the prima facie test of relationship of master and servant is the existence of the right in the master to supervise and control the work done by the servant (the measure of supervision and control apart) not only in the matter of directing what work the servant is to do but also the manner in which he shall do his work...\" However, we may note that in Workmen of the Canteen of Coates of India Ltd. vs. Coates of India Ltd. (Civil Appeal No.3479/1987 disposed of on 28.8.1996, this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 190: \"...some requirement under the Factories Act of providing a canteen in the industrial establishment, is by itself not decisive of the question or sufficient to determine the status of the persons employed in the canteen.\n",
      "Paragraph 191: The effect, if any, relating to compliance of the provisions of Factories Act is a different matter which does not arise for consideration in the present case.\" [See also [?CITATION?]].\n",
      "Paragraph 192: On the aforementioned backdrop of legal principles, We may now consider the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in Steel Authority of India Limited (supra). The principal question which arose for consideration therein was as to whether having regard to the provisions contained in Section 10 of the [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act], the workmen employed by the contractors in the event of abolition of contract labour were entitled to be automatically absorbed in the services of the principal employer. While answering the question in the negative the court reversed the earlier decision of this Court in [?CITATION?]. This Court referring to a large number of decisions and tracing the history of the [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act], noticed that the Industrial Tribunal although prior to coming into force could issue directions for such regularization but such directions could not be issued after coming into force of the Act. In view of the Constitution Bench decision in[?CITATION?], the Court held that although the principle that a beneficial legislation needs to be construed liberally in favour of the class for whose favour it is intended, the same would not extend to reading in the provisions of the Act what the legislature has not provided whether expressly or by necessary implication, or substituting remedy or benefits for that provided by the legislature. Upon analyzing the case law, the categories of cases were sub-divided into three stating :\n",
      "Paragraph 193: \"An analysis of the cases, discussed above, shows that they fall in three classes : (i) where contract labour is engaged in or in connection with the work of an establishment and employment of contract labour is prohibited either because the industrial adjudicator/court ordered abolition of contract labour or because the appropriate Government issued notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, no automatic absorption of the contract labour working in the establishment was ordered; (ii) where the contract was found to be a sham and nominal, rather a camouflage, in which case the contract labour working in the establishment of the principal employer were held, in fact and in reality, the employees of the principal employer himself. Indeed, such cases do not relate to abolition of contract labour but present instances wherein the Court pierced the veil and declared the correct position as a fact at the stage after employment of contract labour stood prohibited; (iii) where in discharge of a statutory obligation of maintaining a canteen in an establishment the principal employer availed the services of a contractor the courts have held that the contract labour would indeed be the employees of the principal employer.\" The instant case although was sought to be put in category (ii) as referred to Steel Authority (supra) by Mr.\n",
      "Paragraph 194: Prasad, he, as noticed hereinbefore, took us also to the case law falling in Class (i) and Class (iii) aforementioned.\n",
      "Paragraph 195: There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that where a person is engaged through an intermediary or otherwise for getting a job done, a question may arise as the appointment of an intermediary was merely sham and nominal and rather than camouflage where a definite plea is raised in Industrial Tribunal or the Labour Court, as the case may be, and in that event, it would be entitled to pierce the veil and arrive at a finding that the justification relating to appointment of a contractor is sham or nominal and in effect and substance there exists a direct relationship of employer and employee between the principal employer and the workman.\n",
      "Paragraph 196: The decision of this Court in [?CITATION?] will fall in that category.\n",
      "Paragraph 197: ANALYSIS:\n",
      "Paragraph 198: Having regard to the aforementioned findings, we are of the opinion, the High Court has rightly affirmed the award of the Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal as also the High Court further rightly arrived at a finding to the effect that the concerned workmen were not able to discharge their burden of proof that they were employed by the Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 199: The decisions referred to hereinbefore are indicative of the fact that the different tests have been applied in different cases having regard to the nature of the problem arising in the fact situation obtaining therein. Emphasis on application of control test and organization test have been laid keeping in view the question as to whether the matter involves a contract of service vis-`-vis contract for service; or whether the employer had set up a contractor for the purpose of employment of workmen by way of a smoke screen with a view to avoid its statutory liability.\n",
      "Paragraph 200: In the present case we are faced with a peculiar situation. The society is a service society which has been formed with the object of protecting the growers from being exploited at the hands of the traders.\n",
      "Paragraph 201: It has been found that the employment of the workmen for doing a particular piece of work is at the instance of the producer or the merchants on an ad hoc basis or job to job basis and, thus, the same may not lead to the conclusion that relationship of employer and employee has come into being. Furthermore, when an employee has a right to work or not when an offer is made to him in this behalf by the producer or by the merchants will also assume significance.\n",
      "Paragraph 202: For the purpose of earning livelihood, a person has to involve himself into certain kinds of activities wherefor, he must subject himself to some sort of discipline or control, which is even otherwise implicit.\n",
      "Paragraph 203: The findings arrived at by the learned Tribunal as well as the High Court would clearly go to show that the concerned workmen are engaged both by the growers as also the traders. Only on some occasions, payment is made to the concerned workmen through the third parties only in a case where the grower is not immediately in a position to pay the same as he was yet to receive the price of the vegetables to be auctioned. We must bear in mind that the Society deals with small and marginal farmers who themselves look after the Society for obtaining such assistance as may be necessary from not being exploited by the traders and had been facing the problem of a forced sale of their produce at the throw away price. The totality of the circumstances as opined by the Tribunal and affirmed by the High Court would clearly go to show that although certain activities are carried out in the market yards wherefor requisite infrastructures are provided, the Society in general does not have the necessity of employing any workman either for the purpose of loading, unloading or grading. Ultimately, the remuneration to the concerned workmen are borne either by the farmers or by the merchants. Presumably the amount paid to the loaders, unloaders and the graders would vary, as for example whereas there would be cases where the growers themselves would unload their merchandise either from trucks or carts. In case growers take the assistance of the concerned persons for unloading after the auction is held the payment would be made by the traders. In a situation of this nature and particularly having regard to the fact that the respondent is a cooperative society which only renders services to its own members and despite the fact that in relation thereto it receives commission at the rate of one per cent both from the farmers as also the traders; it does not involve in any trading activity.\n",
      "Paragraph 204: Although rendition of such service may amount to carrying out an industrial activity within the meaning of the provisions of the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] but we are in this case not concerned with the said question. What we are concerned with is as to whether the concerned workmen have been able to prove that they are workmen of the Society. They have not.\n",
      "Paragraph 205: CONCLUSION :\n",
      "Paragraph 206: In view of what has been found hereinbefore, we are of the opinion that the decision of the Tribunal as affirmed by the High Court cannot be said to be perverse warranting our interference.\n",
      "Paragraph 207: For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in these appeals which are dismissed accordingly. No costs.\n",
      "Paragraph 208: However, before parting with the matter, we may observe that we have no doubt in our mind keeping in view the assurances given to the High Court by the Society, as recorded in its order dated 12.12.2000, the Respondent will continue to see that the concerned employees are provided with employment.\n",

      "Paragraph 2: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 6546-6552 OF 2003 PRADEEP OIL CORPORATION ....Appellant Versus MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF DELHI AND ANR ....Respondents\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Dr. Mukundakam Sharma, J.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 1\\. Whether an agreement for erection of oil storage tank together with pump house, chowkidar cabins, switch room, residential rooms and verandah for storing oil decanted from the railway tankers, which bring petroleum products to the site at which they are decanted, would amount to lease or license, is one of the several questions which falls for consideration in these appeals, which has arisen out of a Full 1 Bench decision rendered by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi while disposing a batch of petitions bearing Nos. LPA 53, 54, 55, 57 and 58/1987.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 2\\. Before dwelling into the question of law involved hereinabove and in order to appreciate the contentions raised by the parties hereto, we may notice few basic fact which has resulted into filing of these appeals.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 3\\. The appellant herein had been granted under the Government Grant Act separate and distinct licenses by the President of India acting through Superintendent of Northern Railway, Delhi for the purpose of maintaining depot for storage of petroleum products at a yearly license fee of Rs. 20,640/- and Rs. 31,000/- per annum respectively.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 4\\. Under the aforesaid grant, the appellant had been given the right to erect/construct `petroleum installation buildings' consisting of petroleum tanks, buildings and other conveniences for receiving and storing therein petroleum in bulk, and consequently possession of land has been given.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 2\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 5\\. Consequent to the said agreement the administration granted `exclusive possession' of the said land to the appellant who entered the land for the purpose and the terms mentioned therein in the aforesaid agreement/grant. Consequently, the appellant submitted layout building plans for the construction of the oil depot and the standing committee of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (in short \"MCD\") approved the layout plan for the construction of 10 oil storage tanks of petroleum products.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 6\\. Subsequent to that the appellant raised various constructions comprising of an administration block etc. along with huge petroleum storage tanks for storing petroleum products. A boundary wall around the installations and the administrative block was also constructed. The nature of the construction which is stated to be wide range and extensive user, is more than 40 years old now.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 7\\. The respondent MCD vide its Order dated 17.08.1984 passed an assessment order with regard to the property tax qua the aforesaid property and confirmed the rateable value 3 proposed by it. The said assessment order was challenged by the appellant before the appellate Court/MCD Tribunal which vide its Order dated 12.7.1985 set aside the assessment order passed by the respondent MCD and held that the appellant is only a licensee in the property and is not a tenant, therefore, no property tax can be levied on the appellant under Section 20(2) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (in short \"MCD Act\"). Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the appellate Court, the respondent MCD filed a writ petition. However, the said writ petition was dismissed by the Ld. Single Judge of the Delhi High Court on 05.08.1986 holding that the petroleum storage tanks do not fall within the definition of building under the MCD Act. It was further held by the Ld. Single Judge that the grant in favour of the petitioner was a license and hence the petitioner is not liable for the payment of any property tax in respect of the land or the petroleum storage tanks. Challenging the aforesaid order of Ld. Single Judge, an LPA was filed and subsequently, the same was referred to a Full Bench of High Court. The Full Bench of the High Court vide its impugned judgment and order dated 17.09.2002 held 4 that the petroleum storage tanks are a building and the petitioner was a lessee and not a licensee in the property in question.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 8\\. It was forcefully argued before us by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant that no property tax is payable qua the property in question under the provisions of section 119 of the DMC Act read with Article 285 of the Constitution of India, as the property in question is a government property. It was further contended that the incidence to pay property tax qua the petroleum installations including the tanks cannot fall upon the appellant under section 120(2) of the DMC Act because the appellant is a mere licencee of government land having permission to construct and consequently having constructed thereupon is neither a tenant nor a lessee and the agreement in question does not create any leasehold right or tenancy in the favour of the appellant. In other words, the submission was that the agreement in question is a licence deed. It was further contended that the petroleum storage tanks/depots are not \"buildings\" and therefore not subject to 5 property tax. It was also argued that the petroleum storage tanks/depots being plant and machinery are liable to be exempted under the provisions of section 116(3) of the DMC Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 9\\. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent MCD submitted that the indentures in question are indeed a lease and not a licence. It was argued that the question as to whether such an oil storage tank would be building or not is no longer res integra in view of judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of [?CITATION?] It has been further contended that that the question as to whether the indentures in question constitute lease or license so as to attract the provisions of Section 120 of the MCD Act would depend upon the construction thereof. It was urged that having regard to the nature of the interest conveyed, it would be erroneous to construe the instrument as a license as the land having been used for the purpose of construction of a building, the object thereof being clear, it could not have been 6 construed to be a license and must be construed to be a lease. It was further argued that it is not a case where it could be said that no interest in the land had been created by reason of the instruments in question.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 10\\. Before addressing the rival contentions, it would be useful to reiterate few relevant provisions of the MCD Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: \"2(3) \"building\" means a house, out-house, stable, latrine, urinal, shed, hut wall (other than a boundary wall) or any other structure, whether of masonry, bricks, wood, mud, metal or other material but does not include any portable shelter\".\n",
      "Paragraph 16: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"2(24). \"land\" includes benefits to arise out of land, things attached to the each or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth and rights created by law over any street:\n",
      "Paragraph 17: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"119\\. Taxation of Union properties.--(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this chapter, lands and buildings being properties of the union shall be exempt from the property taxes specified in Section 114:\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall prevent the Corporation from levying any of the said taxes on such lands and buildings to which 7 immediately before the 26th January, 1950 they were liable or treated as liable so long as that tax continues to be levied by the Corporation on other lands and buildings.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"120(2). If any land has been let for a term exceeding one year to a tenant and such tenant has built upon the land, the property taxes assessed in respect of that land and the building erected thereon shall be primarily livable upon the said tenant, whether the land and building are in the occupation of such tenant or a sub- tenant of such tenant.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"123\\. Property taxes a first charge on premises on which they are assessed.--Property taxes due under this Act in respect of any land or building shall, subject to the prior payment of the land revenue if any, due to the Government thereon be a first charge- (a) in the case of any land or building held immediately from the Government, upon the interest in such land or building of the person liable for such taxes and upon the goods and other movable properties if any found within or upon such land or building and belonging to such person; and (b) in the case of any other land or building upon such land or building and upon the goods and other movable properties/ if any, found within or upon such land or building and belonging to the person liable for such taxes.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 8\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 11\\. We may also notice the language of Article 285 of the Constitution of India which reads as follows: - \"285\\. Exemption of property of the Union from State taxation (1) The property of the Union shall, save insofar as Parliament may by law otherwise provide, be exempt from all taxes imposed by a State or by any authority within a State.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: (2) Nothing in clause (1) shall, until Parliament by law otherwise provides, prevent any authority within a State from levying any tax on any property of the Union to which such property was immediately before the commencement of this Constitution liable or treated as liable, so long as that tax continues to be levied in that State.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 12\\. It would be useful to examine at this stage the definition of \"lease\" and \"license\" as envisaged under Section 105 of the [Transfer of Property Act, 1882] and section 52 of the [Indian Easements Act, 1882] respectively.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: Section 105 of the [Transfer of Property Act, 1882] reads: - \"105\\. Lease Defined.--A lease of immovable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other thing of value, to be 9 rendered periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor by the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such terms.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 26: On the other hand, Section 52 of the [Indian Easements Act], 1882 reads as:\n",
      "Paragraph 27: \"License, defined.--Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful, and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called, a license.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 28: 13\\. A license may be created on deal or parole and it would be revocable. However, when it is accompanied with grant it becomes irrevocable. A mere license does not create interest in the property to which it relates. License may be personal or contractual. A licensee without the grant creates a right in the licensor to enter into a land and enjoy it. In Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edition, Vol. 27 at page 21 it is stated: - \"license coupled with grant of interest: A license coupled with a grant of an interest in property is not revocable. Such a license is capable of 10 assignment, and covenants may be made to run with it. A right to enter on land and enjoy a profit a prendre or other incorporeal hereditament is a license coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. Formerly it was necessary that the grant of the interest should be valid; thus, if the interest was an incorporeal hereditament, such as a right to make and use a watercourse, the grant was not valid unless tinder seal, and the license, unless so made, was therefore a mere license and was revocable but since 1873 the Court has been bound to give effect to equitable doctrines and it will restrain the revocation of a license coupled with a grant which should be, but is not, under seal.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 14\\. Lease on the other hand, would amount to transfer of property. In [?CITATION?], the following well established proposition were laid down by a Constitution Bench for ascertaining whether a transaction amounts to a lease or a license: - \"27\\. There is a marked distinction between a lease and a license. Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act defines a lease of immovable property as a transfer of a right to enjoy such property made for a certain time in consideration for a price paid or promised. Under Section 108 of the said Act, the lessee is entitled to be put in possession of the property. A lease is thereforee a transfer of an interest in land. The interest 11 transferred is called the leasehold interest. The Lesser parts with his right to enjoy the property during the term of the lease, and it follows from it that the lessee gets that right to the exclusion of the Lesser. Whereas Section 52 of the Indian Easement Act defines a license.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: Under the aforesaid section, if a document gives only a right to use the property in a particular way or under certain terms while it remains in possession and control of the owner thereof, it will be a license. The legal possession, thereforee, continues to be with the owner of the property, but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for the permission his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favor any estate or interest in the property. There is, therefore, clear distinction between the two concepts. The dividing line is dear through sometimes it becomes very thin or even blurred. Alone time it was thought that the test of exclusive possession was infallible and if a person was given exclusive possession of a premises, it would conclusively establish that he was a lessee. But there was a change and the recent trend of judicial option is reflected in [?CITATION?], wherein Lord Denning reviewing the case law on the subject summarises the result of his discussion thus at p. 155:\n",
      "Paragraph 31: \"The result of all these cases is that, although a person who is let into exclusive possession is, prima facie to be considered to be tenant, nevertheless he will not be held to be so if the circumstances negative any intention to create a tenancy.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 12\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 15\\. It is quite clear that the distinction between lease and license is marked by the last clause of Section 52 of the Easement Act as by reason of a license, no estate or interest in the property is created. In the case of [?CITATION?] it was observed at p. 398 thus: - \"... If an interest in immovable property, entitling the transferors to enjoyment is created, it is a lease; if permission to use land without right to exclusive possession is alone granted, a license is the legal result.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 34: (emphasis underlined)\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 16\\. A license, inter alia, (a) is not assignable; (b) does not entitle the licensee to sue the stranger in his own name; (c) it is revocable and (d) it is determined when the grantor makes subsequent assignment. The rights and obligations of the lessor as contained in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 are also subject to the contract to the contrary. Even the right of assignment of leasehold property may be curtailed by an agreement.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 13\n",
      "Paragraph 37: 17\\. In the present case grant has been made by the President of India in terms of Section 2 of the Government Grants Act, 1895 and the [Transfer of Property Act, 1882] may have little bearing in the instant case. The former, i.e. the [Government Grants Act, 1895] being a special statute would prevail over the general statute, i.e. the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Accordingly, the rights and obligations of the parties would be governed by the terms of the provisions of [Government Grants Act, 1895] whereunder the Government is entitled to impose limitations and restrictions upon the grants and other transfer made by it or under its authority.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 18\\. In view of the aforesaid legal position with regard to the applicability of the [Government Grants Act], we have considered the grant in question after hearing both the parties at length and perused the entire record.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 19\\. A bare perusal of the grant in question reveals that in the grant, the appellant herein i.e. grantee has been described as licensee. But in our considered view the 14 mere use of the word \"licensee\" would not be sufficient to hold the grant in question as a license. Simply using the word \"licensee\" would neither be regarded as conclusive nor determinative. In terms of Clause (1) of the said indenture the licensee was to have the use of a piece of land for maintaining a depot for petroleum goods received through railways but thereby his rights to deal with the property and the goods brought thereon had not been taken away. Clearly, an embargo has been placed as regards the user of the construction made thereon to the extent that the same would be used solely for the storage of petroleum products but such restriction by itself can also be imposed in a case of lease. The grant in question clearly states that the constructions are to be made as per specifications approved by the Chief Inspector of Explosives which condition was also otherwise governed by the provisions of Explosives Act. Further, the pipelines are required to be laid at railway levels or demised in favor of the grantee, where for expenses are to be paid by it. It further sates that the pipelines are to be laid 15 underground in such a manner that vehicles can pass over that.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 20\\. The present appellant i.e. licensee is required to pay the sum specified therein which has been described as 'rent' in terms of Clause 7. It further reveals that the licensee is also required to pay all taxes payable in respect of the said land for the time being found to be payable and proportionately and all cesses, and taxes in respect of the premises applicable to the land, tanks, works and conveniences if the same be not separately assessed in respect thereof. It further stipulates that the licensee shall not be entitled to assign, mortgage, sub-let or otherwise transfer the privileges without previously obtaining the consent in writing of the Administration. The licensee shall not use the said land or any part thereof or permit the same to be used for worship, or religious or educational purposes or for any other purpose not specified in Clause 1 thereof but such a claim is not determinative. Clause (9) of the said 16 indenture stipulates that either party would be entitled to terminate the license without assigning any reasons by giving to the other party at any time three calendar months' notice in writing. It is to be noted that even under Section 106 of the [Transfer of Property Act, 1882] no reason is required to be assigned for determining the lease.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 21\\. Further, Clause 11 of the indenture in question provides that nothing contained herein be construed to create a tenancy in favor of the licensee of the said land but again in our considered view, the mere description of the grant in question is not decisive. Under the grant in question, the Administration has been given power under Clause 12 to re-enter upon and retake and absolutely retain the possession of the said land but the same could be permissible in law only upon determination of grant which would require 3 months' prior notice. It is to be noted that Clause 12 further stipulates that the licensee shall at all times keep the Administration indemnified 17 against and shall reimburse it towards all claims, demands, suits, losses, damages, costs etc. which it may sustain or incur by reason of inconsequence of any injury to any person or to any property resulting from any explosion or leakage of any petroleum kept or placed by the licensee upon the said land.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 22\\. Clause 14 of the indenture in question provides that the licensee shall follow all petroleum rules and regulations applicable to the construction, maintenance of petrol pump or stores and for public safety. It is significant to note that the aforesaid clause clearly provides that all taxes in respect of the said patrol pump, stores, buildings under the control of the licensee shall be paid by the licensee. However, the rights of the parties on determination of the grant have been specified.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 23\\. The aforesaid clauses of the indenture in question clearly shows that a bundle of rights have been conferred upon the grantee i.e. the appellant herein. 18\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 24\\. It is well settled legal position that a deed must be read in its entirety and reasonably. The intention of the parties must also as far as possible be gathered from the expression used in the document itself.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 25\\. In [?CITATION?], an instrument was held to be a deed of lease as the lessee was conferred right to exclusive possession where for various terms of the indenture which were taken into consideration for finding out whether the same was lease or a license. Similarly, In [?CITATION?], where the defendant was given exclusive possession of the disputed premises for running a hotel but was not given the permission to sub- lease the property, the document was held to be a license.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: \"9\\. .... this Court has indicated that for a consideration as to whether a document creates a license or lease, the substance of the document must be preferred to the form. It is not correct to say that exclusive possession of a party is irrelevant but at the same it is also not 19 conclusive. The other tests, namely, intention of the parties and whether the document creates any interest in the property or not are important considerations.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 47: 26\\. In [?CITATION?], a deal was held to be a license where the keys of the premises was to be taken in the morning and returned in the evening and a portion thereof was occupied by the mother of the licensor.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 27\\. In [?CITATION?] it was held: - \"3\\. On a careful consideration of the above arguments, we feel that there is no substance in any one of them. To our mind it is very clear that the right granted under the above document is nothing but a license. Our reasons are as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 49: (1) the nomenclature of the document is license. Of course, we hasten to add that nomenclature is not always conclusive;\n",
      "Paragraph 50: (2) the document in question in no unambiguous terms says that the possession and control shall remain with the owner. This is a clear indication of the fact that no interest in immovable property has been conferred on the grantee. If it were to be a case of lease under Section 105 of the [Transfer of Property Act], there must be an interest in the immovable property. On the 20 contrary, if it were to be a license under Section 52 of the Easements Act, no such interest in immovable property is created. The case on hand is one of such.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: (4) No doubt there is a statement in the document that \"I shall not sublet it to further anybody else. This is nothing more than an affirmation of the requirement that the licensee must use the property. No doubt under Section 52 of the Easements Act, license is personal but where an affirmation is made that such an affirmation cannot alter the relationship of the parties as Lesser and lessee. In this view factually the case [?CITATION?], Quoted from the judgment and order dated 3.5.1993 of Andhra Pradesh Admn. Tribunal at Hyderabad in OA No. 47322/91 and 5668/92, is distinguishable.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 52: 28\\. In [?CITATION?], an assignment made to the effect that the owner permitted the licensee to occupy a portion with no right or interest created in his favor and also undertaken to vacant the premises within one month, was held to be a case of license.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 29\\. In view of the aforesaid well settled legal position, whether a particular document will constitute \"lease\" or \"license\" 21 would inter alia depend upon certain factors which can be summarized as follows: - (a) whether a document creates a license or lease, the substance of the document must be preferred to the form;\n",
      "Paragraph 54: (b) the real test is the intention of the parties -- whether they intended to create a lease or a license;\n",
      "Paragraph 55: (c) if the document creates an interest in the property, it is a lease; but if it only permits another to make use of the property, of which the legal possession continues with the owner, it is a license; and (d) if under the document a party gets exclusive possession of the property, prima facie, he is considered to be a tenant; but circumstances may be established which negative the intention to create a lease.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 30\\. Reverting back to the factual situation of the case at hand, admittedly, the appellant is in possession of the buildings 22 in question since 1958. They have been permitted to raise huge constructions and the nature of construction is of wide range. An administration block along with tanks for storing petroleum had been constructed. A boundary wall around installations and administrative block had also been constructed. Admittedly, the grantee is in exclusive possession over the lands in question along with construction thereon without any let or hindrance from the Administration. Further, the appellant had been continuously carrying on their business without any interference from any quarter whatsoever since 1962. As in the instant case, exclusive possession has been granted, as discussed hereinbefore, there is a strong presumption in favour of tenancy. That being the case, it is for the appellant to show that despite the right to possess the demised premises exclusive; a right or interest in the property has not been created. The burden therefore would be on the appellant/grantee to prove contra.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: 23\n",
      "Paragraph 58: 31\\. The aforesaid burden is not discharged in the present case rather for the purposes resisting its eviction from the suit land in the proceeding initiated under the Public Premises Unauthorized Occupants Eviction Act, the appellant has taken the stand pleading non-applicability of the Indian Easement Act and has themselves termed the arrangement as a tenancy by describing the fee as rentals. The said factor is also a vital factor as on the own showing of the appellant the arrangement was nothing but a lease. The appellant therefore cannot take up a plea by which they approbate and reprobate at the same time.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 32\\. In [?CITATION?], it was held that when exclusive possession is granted in lieu of only rent payable therefore, the presumption that the instrument is that of a lease becomes stronger. In the present case the Administration has also option to revise the rent. Had it been a case of mere right to use the property, such provision would not have been there. Further, the manner in which the rent is to be paid is also 24 important. It is to be paid annually in a case of a license pure and simple, the indenture would not normally contain a claim that rent would be paid annually.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 33\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 61: \"However, this cannot answer the disputed issue as it creates a license or lease, the substance of the document must be referred to the form, As was observed by this Court in [?CITATION?] , the real test is the intention of the parties -- whether they intended to create a lease or license. If an interest in the property is created by the deed it is a lease but if the document only permits another person to make use of the property \"of which the legal possession continues with the owner\" it is a license. If the party in whose favor the document is executed gets exclusive possession of the property prima facie he must be considered to be a tenant: although this factor by itself will not be decisive. Judged in this light, there does not appear to be any scope for interpreting Ex. 20 as an agreement of leave and license.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 62: 34\\. It is true that there are indeed certain restrictions which have been imposed by the Administration with regard to the construction of the building storage tank, etc., but in our considered view such restrictions are not decisive for 25 the purpose of determining as to whether a document is a lease or license as such restrictions could also be imposed in case of a lease as well. In [?CITATION?], it was held:\n",
      "Paragraph 63: \"In the so-called license itself it is called indifferently a license and a demise, but in the Act it is spoken of as a lease, and the holder of it is described as the lessee. It is not, however, a question of words, but of substance. If the effect of the instrument is to give the holder an exclusive right of occupation of the land though subject to certain reservations or to a restriction of the purposes for which it may be used, it is in law a demise of the land itself.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 35\\. We may also notice the undisputed fact that in the present case the parties have agreed that for the purpose of determination of the agreement three calendar months' notice had to be given. Undoubtedly, such clause in the document in question has a significant role to play in the matter of construction of document. Clearly, if the parties to the agreement intended that by reason of such agreement merely a license would be created such a term could not have been inserted. 26\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 36\\. It is well settled legal position that a license can be revoked at any time at the pleasure of the licensor. Even otherwise, unless the parties to the agreement had an intention to enter into a deed of lease the Administration would not have agreed to demise the premises on payment of rent in lieu of grant of exclusive possession of the demised land and further stipulated service of three months' notice calling upon either party to terminate the agreement. In view of the same, the argument advanced by the learned counsel of the appellant that a stipulation having been made in the agreement itself that by reasons thereof the grantee shall not be a tenant and thus the deed must be construed to be a license cannot be accepted. In our considered view, such a clause may at best be one of the factors for construction of the document in question but the same by itself certainly be a decisive factor.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 37\\. The next question which needs to be addressed in view of the aforesaid well settled legal position is whether the agreement in question should be interpreted as lease or 27 license having regard to the object sought to be achieved by the provisions of DMC Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 38\\. By reason of the provisions of the DMC Act, the MCD is required to render several services as specified therein for the purpose whereof, tax is required to be imposed both on land as also on building. The definition of \"land\" and '\"building\" as provided in the DMC Act must be given its full effect. As mentioned hereinbefore in the case of Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay case (supra), even an oil tanker has been held to be building.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: 39\\. The tax is imposed upon the holders of land and building by the MCD which is compensatory in nature. The word \"letting out\" in the context of the grant therefore must receive its purposive meaning. The MCD renders services and the benefits of such services are being taken by all concerned, viz., the owner of the land or building. Even a person who is in possession of a land or building, whether legal or illegal, takes benefits of such services rendered by the MCD. The MCD for the purpose of realization of tax is 28 not concerned with the relationship of the parties. It is concerned only with imposition and recovery of tax which is payable on all lands and buildings in accordance with law. The exceptions thereof have been enumerated in the Act itself. Section 119 of the MCD Act is one of such provisions. Such an exemption clause, as is well known, must be construed strictly. Section 119 of the MCD Act would apply if the lands and buildings are the properties of Union of India. The MCD has the right to levy the property tax in terms of Section 114 of the MCD Act in the manner as specified therein.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 40\\. By reason of the agreement in question, the buildings in question do not belong to the Administration. Admittedly, it belongs to the grantee i.e. appellant herein. As discussed hereinbefore, the Oil tanks has been construed as buildings for the purposes of tax. Therefore, Section 119 of the MCD Act would not apply to the building in question. That being the case, the grantee/appellant is liable to pay tax although the ownership of the land may belong to the 29 Administration. Section 115 of the MCD Act clearly provides that the general tax shall be payable in respect of lands and buildings. Such lands and buildings may be in lawful occupation of the owner. The occupation of the said building may be lawful or unlawful. Even in a case where apartments are constructed on the land belonging to the Government or a statutory body but the occupier of the apartment is liable to pay tax. If a person encroaches upon somebody's lands and constructs buildings thereupon, he would also be liable to pay tax. Once it is held that the grantee were liable to pay tax, the same becomes payable from the date of accrual of the liability. The said position is also fortified from specific stipulation in the agreement that the liability to pay all taxes including municipal taxes is on the grantee.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: 41\\. The learned counsel for the appellant has placed strong reliance on the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?] to contend that land belonging to the government is immune from the payment of property tax by 30 virtue of section 119(1) of the DMC Act and Article 285 of the Constitution of India. In the HUDCOs case vacant land of the government, prior to execution of the lease deed in favour of HUDCO, was sought to be taxed and that no building had been constructed by HUDCO. HUDCOs own case was that interest in land could pass only on execution of lease and construction thereon under section 120(2) of the MCD Act. MCD had invoked Section 120(1) DMC Act to fasten liability on HUDCO and not under Section 120(2) DMC Act after construction was made by HUDCO and lease deed executed bythe government. In that case, this Court has held that vacant land belonging to the Government was not taxable by virtue of section 119 DMC Act and Article 285 of the Constitution of India. However, in our considered view, the case at hand is totally different. The HUDCO judgment dealt with the case where vacant land belonging to the lessor/Government and in regard whereto no lease deed had been executed and no construction had been made by the lessee/HUDCO. The land belonging to the central government was sought to be taxed under 31 section 120(1) of the DMC Act which fastens liability on the lessor. Since land belonged to UOI the same was exempted from payment of tax until the lease deed was executed and construction made thereon by HUDCO-under Section 120(2).\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 42\\. Incidence to pay tax under section 120(2) DMC Act is with regard to a composite assessment of land and buildings as section 120(2) talks of a composite assessment only. In the present case vacant land or property of Railways is not under section 120(1) DMC Act, but property tax/Composite Assessment is sought to be made on the installations/stotage depots having been constructed by the appellant-by virtue of Section 120(2) DMC Act. It is important to notice that w.e.f. the date of execution of lease deed and construction made thereon by HUDCO, HUDCO has been paying the property tax. HUDCOs case is therefore not applicable.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: 32\n",
      "Paragraph 73: 43\\. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the considered view that the document in question constitutes lease in favor of the appellant-grantee; and accordingly liable to pay taxes.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: 44\\. In view of the same, we find no merit in the present appeal, accordingly, the same is liable to be dismissed and hence dismissed. No order as to costs. \n"

      "Paragraph 1: Although I agree with the conclusions arrived at by my learned Brother, having regard to the importance of the question involved, I would like to assign additional reasons therefor.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: The High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction in a matter of this nature is required to determine at the outset as to whether a case has been made out for issuance of a writ of certiorari or a writ of quo warranto. The jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of quo warranto is a limited one. While issuing such a writ, the court merely makes a public declaration but will not consider the respective impact of the candidates or other factors Union of India and Others reported in [?CITATION?] A writ of quo warranto can only be issued when the appellant is contrary to statutory rules. [See [?CITATION?]] When questioned, Mr. R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel on behalf of the respondents fairly stated that in this case the High Court was concerned with the question as to whether a writ of quo warranto can be issued or not. Thus, with a view to find out as to whether a case has been made out for issuance of quo warranto, the only question which was required to be considered was as to whether Shri N.A. Acharya fulfilled the qualifications laid down under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act 1946 or not. The Full Bench of the High Court has mainly proceeded on the basis that the Industrial Court was required to have three or more members, one of whom shall be President as specified in sub- section (2) of Section 10 and, thus, a person before he is appointed as the President must necessarily be appointed as a Member. In my opinion, while arriving at the said finding what the High Court has failed to take into consideration was that sub-section (2) of Section 10 did not impose any restriction on the power of the State to appoint a Member or a President.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: The said provision merely speaks of the composition of the Court of Industrial Arbitration. The expression 'shall consist of three or more Members' is important. Sub-section (2) of Section 10 provides for the composition of the Tribunal and nothing else. By necessary implication a President of the Court of Industrial Arbitration would also have to be a Member and precisely that was the reason why no separate qualification for the appointment of a qualification has been laid down in the Act. Sub- section (4) of Section 10 of the Act lays down the eligibility criteria of a Member only. It is, therefore, significant that for the purpose of appointment of a Member as also the President of the Court of Industrial Arbitration the eligibility criteria remain the same.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: The legitimate expectation of a Member to be promoted to the Post of the Chairman as has been submitted by Mr. Venkataramani will, thus, have no relevance as nobody has a vested right to be promoted.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: It may be true that reference has been made by the High Court while making the recommendations to the draft rules known as Draft Recruitment Rules but it appears from the records that the said draft rules, purported to have been framed by the High Court for replacing the Recruitment Rules for the Post of President as contained at Item 34 in the Handbook of Guidelines on Recruitment Rules of Officers under Labour and Employment Department, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, December, 1990, were published in the year 1992.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: It is now trite that draft rules which are made to lie in a nascent state for a long time cannot be the basis for making appointment or recommendation. Rules even in their draft stage can be acted upon provided there is a clear intention on the part of the Government to enforce those rules reported in [?CITATION?] Sub- section (4) of Section 10 of the Act states that a Member of the Industrial Court shall be a person who is or has been a Judge of High Court or is eligible for being appointed a Judge of such Court. Article 217 of the Constitution of India inter alia lays down the qualification to be possessed by a citizen for his appointment as a High Court Judge. It has not been and could not be disputed that Shri N.A. Acharya has the requisite qualification.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: The other and further qualifications for appointment of a member have been laid down in the provisos appended thereto. The qualifications specified in the said provisos are meant for those who do not satisfy the requirements of main provision. First and Second provisos appended to sub-section (4) of Section 10 are exceptions to the main provision. Once it is held that sitting judicial officers can be appointed either as Member or President of the Court of Industrial Arbitration, indisputably the High Court is required to be consulted therefor. It is for the High Court and High Court alone to nominate a person of its choice. Such a practice is followed by all the High Courts of the country and although the ultimate authority is the State, the recommendations made by the High Court is normally accepted.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: A statute as is well-known must be interpreted having regard to the purport and object which it seeks to achieve. The object of the Act is to constitute Industrial Arbitration Court for the purpose of adjudication of the disputes between the management and the workmen. Such courts which are normally manned by the judicial officers cannot be kept vacant for a long time. Whenever they are meant to be filled up by the sitting judicial officers, consultation with the High Court is imperative.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: Although we do not find any difficulty in interpreting the provisions, even if it be assumed that the provisions of Sub-section (2) and sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Act render two different meanings, it is trite, that in such an event the rule of purposive construction should be taken recourse to.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: and Others [(2000) 6 SCC 127] while interpreting the provisions dealing with the question as regard the duties and functions of Committee of Management of the Society constituted under Kerala Cooperative Societies Act, 1969 this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 11: \"The duty of such a committee or an administrator is to set right the default, if any, and to enable the society to carry on its functions as enjoined by law.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: Thus, the role of an administrator or a committee appointed by the Registrar while the Committee of Management is under supersession, is, as pointed out by this Court, only to bring on an even keel a ship which was in doldrums. If that is the objective and is borne in mind, the interpretation of these provisions will not be difficult.\" and Another [(2000) 7 SCC 93], while considering the provisions of the Bombay Money Lenders Act vis--vis the provisions of other Acts upon a purposive and meaningful interpretation held that the banks do not come under the purview of the Assam Money Lenders Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: Others [(2000) 7 SCC 357] this Court noticed:\n",
      "Paragraph 14: \"25. In regard to purposive interpretation, Justice Frankfurter observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 15: Legislation has an aim, it seeks to obviate some mischief, to supply an inadequacy, to effect a change of policy, to formulate a plan of government. That aim, that policy is not drawn, like nitrogen, out of the air; it is evidenced in the language of the statute, as read in the light of other external manifestations of purpose [Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 26\\. That principle has been applied to this very Act Canara Bank. If the said principle is applied, it is clear that the provision in Section 31 must be construed in such a manner that, after the Act, no suit by the Bank is decided by the civil court and all such suits are decided by the Tribunal.\" SCC 538] it was held:\n",
      "Paragraph 17: \"The mere use of the word 'reservation' per se does not have the consequence of ipso facto applying the entire mechanism underlying the constitutional concept of a protective reservation specially designed for the advancement of any socially-and-educationally-backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, to enable them to enter and adequately represent in various fields. The meaning, content and purport of the expression will necessarily depend upon the purpose and object with which it is used.\" The Court while interpreting the provision of a statute, although, is not entitled to re-write the statute itself, is not debarred from \"ironing out the creases\". The court should always make an attempt to uphold the rules and interpret the same in such a manner which would make it workable.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: It is also a well settled principles of law that an attempt should be made to give effect to each and every word employed in a statute and such interpretation which would render a particular provision redundant or otiose should be avoided.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: In [?CITATION?], this Court said:- \"Interpretation must depend on the text and the context.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: They are the basis of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to any as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation, Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place..\" In \"The Interpretation and Application of Statutes\" by Reed Dickersen, the author at page 135 has discussed the subject while dealing with the importance of context of the statute in the following terms:- \".The essence of the language is to reflect, express, and perhaps even effect the conceptual matrix of established ideas and values that identifies the culture to which it belongs. For this reason, language has been called 'conceptual map of human experience'.\" The purport and object of the Statute is to see that a Tribunal becomes functional and as such the endeavors of the Court would be to see that to achieve the same, an interpretation of Section 10 of the Act be made in such a manner so that appointment of a President would be possible even at the initial constitution thereof.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: Such a construction is permissible by taking recourse to the doctrine of strained construction, as has been succinctly dealt with by Francis Bennion in his Statutory Interpretation. At Section 304, of the treatise;\n",
      "Paragraph 23: purposive construction has been described in the following manner:- \"A purposive construction of an enactment is one which gives effect to the legislative purpose by (a) following the literal meaning of the enactment where that meaning is in accordance with the legislative purpose (in this Code called a purposive-and-literal construction), or (b) applying a strained meaning where the literal meaning is not in accordance with the legislative purpose (in the Code called a purposive-and-strained construction).\n",
      "Paragraph 24: In [?CITATION?], it was held that severance may be effected even where the 'blue pencil' technique is impracticable.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: In [?CITATION?], the law is stated in the following terms:- \"I am not reluctant to adopt a purposive construction where to apply the literal meaning of the legislative language used would lead to results which would clearly defeat the purposes of the Act. But in doing so the task on which a court of justice is engaged remains one of construction, even where this involves reading into the Act words which are not expressly included in [?CITATION?] provides an instance of this; but in that case the three conditions that must be fulfilled in order to justify this course were satisfied. First, it was possible to determine from a consideration of the provisions of the Act read as a whole precisely what the mischief was that it was the purpose of the Act to remedy; secondly, it was apparent that the draftsman and Parliament had by inadvertence overlooked, and so omitted to deal with an eventuality that required to be dealt with if the purpose of the Act was to be achieved; and thirdly, it was possible to state with certainty what were the additional words that would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by Parliament had their attention been drawn to the omission before the Bill passed into law. Unless this third condition is fulfilled any attempt by a court of justice to repair the omission in the Act cannot be justified as an exercise of its jurisdiction to determine what is the meaning of a written law which Parliament has passed.\" In Principles of Statutory Interpretation of Justice G.P. Singh, 5th Edition, 1992, it is stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 26: \"The Supreme Court in [?CITATION?] approved the rule of construction stated by DENNING, L.J. while dealing with the definition of 'Industry in the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] . The definition is so general and ambiguous that BEG, C.J. said that the situation called for \"some judicial heroics to cope with the difficulties raised\". K.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: IYER, J., who delivered the leading majority judgment in that case referred with approbation the passage extracted above from the judgment of DENNING,L.J. in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. vs. Asher. But in the same continuation he also cited a passage from the speech of LORD SIMONDS in the case of [?CITATION?] as if it also found a part of the judgment of DENNING, L.J. This passage reads: \"The duty of the court is to interpret the words that the legislature has used. Those words may be ambiguous, but, even if they are, the power and duty of the Court to travel outside them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited.\" As earlier noticed LORD SIMONDS and other Law Lords in Magor and St. Mellon's case were highly critical of the views of DENNING, L.J. However, as submitted above, the criticism is more because of the unconventional manner in which the rule of construction was stated by him. In this connection it is pertinent to remember that although a court cannot supply a real casus omissus it is equally clear that it should not so interpret a statute as to create a casus omissus when there is really none.\" In [?CITATION?] at 524 the rule of addition of word had been held to be permissible in the following words:- \"We are of the view that having regard to the pattern in which clause (a) of sub- section (3) of Section 10 of the Act is enacted and also the context, the words 'if the landlord required it for his own use or for the use of any member of his family' which are found in sub-clause (ii) of Section 10(3)(a) of the Act have to be read also into sub-clause (iii) of Section 10(3)(a) of the Act. Sub- clauses (ii) and (iii) both deal with the non-residential buildings. They could have been enacted as one sub- clauses by adding a conjunction 'and' between the said two sub-clauses, in which event the clause would have read thus : 'in case it is a non-residential building which is used for the purpose of keeping a vehicle or adapted for such use if the landlord required it for his own use or for the use of any member of his family and if he or any member of his family is not occupying any such building in the city, town or village concerned which is his own;\n",
      "Paragraph 28: and in case it is any other non-residential building, if the landlord or member of his family is carrying on, a non- residential building in the city, town or village concerned which is his own'. If the two sub-clauses are not so read, it would lead to an absurd result.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: In [?CITATION?], this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 30: \"The court has to interpret a statute and apply it to the facts. Hans Kelsen in his Pure Theory of Law. (p. 355) makes a distinction between interpretation by the science of law or jurisprudence on the one hand and interpretation by a law-applying organ (especially the court) on the other. According to him \"jurisprudential interpretation is purely cognitive ascertainment of the meaning of legal norms. In contradistinction to the interpretation by legal organs, jurisprudential interpretation does not create law\". \"The purely cognitive interpretation by jurisprudence is therefore unable to fill alleged gaps in the law. The filling of a so-called gap in the law is a law-creating function that can only be performed by a law-applying organ; and the function of creating law is not performed by jurisprudence interpreting law. Jurisprudential interpretation can do no more than exhibit all possible meanings of a legal norm.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: Jurisprudence as cognition of law cannot decide between the possibilities exhibited by it, but must leave the decision to the legal organ who, according to the legal order, is authorised to apply the law\". According to the author if law is to be applied by a legal organ, he must determine the meaning of the norms to be applied : he must 'interpret' those norms (p. 348). Interpretation therefore is an intellectual activity which accompanies the process of law application in its advance from a higher level to a lower level. According to him, the law to be applied is a frame. \"There are cases of intended or unintended indefiniteness at the lower level and several possibilities are open to the application of law.\" The traditional theory believes that the statute, applied to a concrete case, can always supply only one correct decision and that the positive-legal 'correctness' of this decision is based on the statute itself. This theory describes the interpretive procedure as if it consisted merely in an intellectual act of clarifying or understanding; as if the law-applying organ had to use only his reason but not his will, and as if by a purely intellectual activity, among the various existing possibilities only one correct choice could be made in accordance with positive law. According to the author :\n",
      "Paragraph 32: \"The legal act applying a legal norm may be performed in such a way that it conforms (a) with the one or the other of the different meanings of the legal norm, (b) with the will of the norm-creating authority that is to be determined somehow, (c) with the expression which the norm-creating authority has chosen, (d) with the one or the other of the contradictory norms; or (e) the concrete case to which the two contradictory norms refer may be decided under the assumption that the two contradictory norms annul each other. In all these cases, the law to be applied constitutes only a frame within which several applications are possible, whereby every act is legal that stays within the frame.\" In [?CITATION?] this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 33: \"It is a well-known rule of interpretation of statutes that the text and the context of the entire Act must be looked into while interpreting any of the expressions used in a statute. The courts must look to the object which the statute seeks to achieve while interpreting any of the provisions of the Act. A purposive approach for interpreting the Act is necessary.\" Another [2003 AIR SCW 653] this Court noticed Section 3 of U.P. Public Services (Tribunal) Act which provided for different qualifications for Chairman, Vice-Chairman (Judicial) and Vice-Chairman (Administration) as also Judicial and Administrative Members of the Service Tribunal. A Bench of this Court of which one of us (Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India) was a member held that as appointment of Chairman, Vice Chairman (Judicial), Vice- Chairman(Administration) and Members are to be made in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Act is intra vires.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: The said decision is also a pointer to show that whenever a post is to be filled up by the Judicial Member who is eligible to be appointed as a High Court Judge, consultation with the High Court is imperative.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: Furthermore, if the interpretation of Section 10 of the Act as propounded by the High Court is accepted, no President can be appointed directly by the State at the time of Constitution of the Court. Such a situation, therefore, would lead to absurdity if it is held that the candidate must first be appointed as a Member and the Post of President can be filled up inter alia by way of promotion or otherwise. When literal interpretation of a provision leads to absurdity or manifest injustice, it is trite, the same must be avoided.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: Furthermore, if the legislature intended to lay down different qualifications or eligibility criteria for the President and the Members, it would have expressly stated so. We may in this connection notice the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: In absence of an express provision providing either for different qualification or eligibility criteria or the selection process, the same procedure for appointment must be followed.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Both under the existing rules as also the Draft Rules mode and manner of appointment have been laid down. Even in absence of the Draft Rules in terms of Rule 34 of the Recruitment Rules for the President of Industrial Court appointment can be made by nomination. Thus, appointment to the Post of President could be made by way of nomination also subject to the nominees holding requisite qualifications laid down therefor.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: It is further trite that non-mentioning or wrong mentioning of a provision of law would not invalidate an order if a source therefor can be found out either under general law or a statute law.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: It is further well-settled that when there are two sources of power, even if one is not applicable, the order will not become invalid if the power of the statutory authority can be traced to another source.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: For the reasons aforementioned, taking any view of the matter it cannot be said that the appointment of Shri N.A. Acharya was illegal or invalid. The impugned judgment, therefore, cannot be sustained which is, therefore, set aside. The appeal is allowed.\n"

      "Paragraph 1: 1\\. This appeal is directed against the Division Bench decision of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur, dated 20.03.2002, in W.P.No.1065 of 2001, in and by which, the Division Bench allowed the writ petition in part. The challenge in the writ petition was to the amendment introduced to Sections 2, 4, 9 and 17, as well as insertion of Sections 31-A, 31-B, 31- C, 37-A, 37-B to the Maharshi Mahesh Yogi Vedic Vishwavidyalaya Adhiniyam, 1995 (Act No.37 of 1995), hereinafter referred to as 1995 Act. The amendment was by way of Amendment Act No.5 of 2000, hereinafter called the Amendment Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: 2\\. The Division Bench upheld the amendment to Section 4(1) of 1995 Act. The Division Bench also held that the amendment to Sections 9(2), 31-A(1) and (2), 31-B, 31-C, 37-B(a), 37-B(b), 37-B(d) and 37-B (e) are intra-vires.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: The Division Bench further held that the proviso to Section 4 is intra- vires, as far as it provides that no Centres shall be established without prior approval of the State Government and no centre would mean no further Centres excluding the existing ones. The Division Bench further held that the said proviso as far as it stipulated that no courses should be conducted or run without the prior approval of the State Government is ultra-vires, as far as, it related to the present stream of courses and the existing Centres. Section 37-A was held to be ultra-vires in its entirety.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: Section 37-B (e) was held to be not ultra-vires.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 3\\. To understand the scope of challenge made in this appeal, the brief facts are required to be stated. The appellant is the University, which was a creation by way of a Statute viz., 1995 Act. Therefore, in the forefront, it will be better to note the scheme of the Act, which received the assent of the Governor on 25th November 1995 and was published in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette dated 29th November 1995. The Preamble of the Act would state that it was an Act to establish and incorporate a University, in the State of Madhya Pradesh and to provide for education and prosecution of research in Vedic learnings and practices and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 2 defines the various expressions, including the expressions Board of Management, Distance Education System, Institution, Statutes and Ordinance and the definition of University under Section 2(u) means the appellant University. Again Section 3(1) refers to the appellant University and Section 3(2) refers to the headquarters of the University to be at village Karondi in District Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, providing for establishment of campuses at such other places within its jurisdiction. Under sub-section (3) to Section 3, the First Chancellor, Vice Chancellor and the first Members of the Board of Management of the Academic Council etc., has been set out.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 4\\. The crucial section is Section 4 and in particular sub-clause (1) of Section 4, which refers to the powers of the University, which specifically states that such power would provide for instruction in all branches of Vedic Learning, as well as promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit, as the University may from time to time determine and also to make provision for research and for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 5\\. Sub-clauses (ii) to (xxviii) of Section 4 refers to the various other powers such as granting diplomas and certificates; to organize and undertake extra-mural studies; conferment of honorary degree; facilities for distance education system; to recognize an institution of higher learning for such purposes as the University may determine; to recognize persons for imparting instructions in any college or institution maintained by the University; to appoint persons working in any other University or organization, as a teacher of the University for a specific period; to create teaching, as well as administrative posts; to co-operate or collaborate with any other University or authority; to establish other campus, special centers, specified laboratories etc., to institute and award fellowships, scholarships etc., to establish and maintain colleges and institutions; to make provision for research and advisory service; to organize and conduct refresher courses; to make special arrangements for teaching women students; to appoint on contract or otherwise visiting professors, scholars; to confer autonomous status on a college or an institution or a department; to determine standards of admission of the University etc.; to fix quota for reserved class students; to demand and receive payment of fees and other charges; to take care of the hostels of the students with other inmates of the college; to lay down conditions of service of all categories of employees; to frame discipline; to receive benefications, gifts, etc., and to do all such other acts and things as may be necessary, incidental or conducive for attainment of all or any of its objects.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 6\\. Section 5 states that the jurisdiction of the University would extend to the whole of the State of Madhya Pradesh. The status of the Chancellor has been described in Section 9. Sub-section (1) of Section 9 recognizes the status of Maharshi Mahesh Yogi as its first Chancellor, who was entitled to hold office during his lifetime. Sub-section (2) to Section 9 provides the manner in which the next Chancellor can be appointed by the Board of Management and the qualification and eligibility for appointment as Chancellor. Section 10 deals with the position of the Vice Chancellor, qualification and procedure for filling up of the said post. Section 11 deals with the status of the Pro-Vice Chancellor. Sections 12, 13 and 14 deals with the position of Deans of Schools, the Registrar and the Finance Officer of the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 7\\. Section 15 deals with the manner of appointment, powers and duties of the other officers of the University, which has to be prescribed by the Statutes. Sections 17 and 18 specifically deal with the power of the Board of Management and its constitution. Section 19 deals with the Academic Council, while Section 20 deals with the Planning Board and Section 24 enumerates the powers to make Statutes and the provisions to be contained therein. Section 25 enumerates as to how the Statues has to be made.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: Section 26 stipulates as to how all Ordinances should be made. Section 28 deals with the preparation of annual report of the University, including the annual accounts and the balance sheet duly audited by a chartered accountant under the direction of the Board of Management. Sections 30 and 31 prescribe the procedure for appeal and arbitration in disciplinary cases against students. Section 32 deals with the creation of provident and pension funds. Section 34 deals with the constitution of committees, while Section 35 deals with the manner in which the casual vacancies are to be filled up. The transitional provisions are specified in Section 38 of the Act. The last Section 39 stipulates that every Statute, Ordinance or Regulation made under the Act, should be published in the Official Gazette and that it should be laid down, as soon as it is made before the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 8\\. A conspicuous reading of the above provisions of the 1995 Act, discloses that the appellant University was established and incorporated under Section 3 of the Act. At the very outset, it must be stated that the establishment of the University itself was at the behest of Maharshi Mahesh Yogi, who was the man behind the institution and was an inspiration, if we may say so, for the establishment and effective functioning of it. The State Government came forward to pass the legislation for establishing the appellant University on his initiative and persuasion. It was his vision of spreading total knowledge on the holistic interpretation of the Vedas and it must be stated that his move to propagate natural law and technology of consciousness was very laudable. It is stated that he was instrumental for establishing many such Universities at various places throughout the world. Therefore, it was his vision, as well as mission, to establish this University with the laudable object of spreading the holistic principle enshrined in the Vedas, Upvedas, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas, as well as Gyan-Vigyan.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 9\\. The purport of establishing this University at his instance was to ensure that the ancient knowledge embedded in those Vedas, Upvedas, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas etc., are kept intact and the wealth of knowledge contained in these Vedas, Upvedas etc., are not only spread by establishing an institution, but by teaching them through well established institutions and thereby, ensuring that such wealth of knowledge is kept intact for the future generations to come.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 10\\. In this context, we must state that the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in its scholarly judgment has dealt with the intricacies of the wealth of knowledge contained in Vedas, running for several pages and hence, we only state that the same shall be read as part and parcel of this judgment for its better understanding.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 11\\. When we refer to the subjects dealt with in Vedas, it will be worthwhile to note the details garnered and noted in the judgment of the Division Bench, which in our considered opinion have to be referred to in order to appreciate the challenge made to the amendment by the State Government with particular reference to Section 4(1) of the 1995 Act. In fact the Division Bench has dealt with the above aspects in several pages, however, for the purpose of this case, it will be sufficient if we refer to certain relevant portions of the judgment in order to get a better understanding that the concept of Vedas deals with various aspects of life, which also includes science in general, as well as human autonomy.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: Reference can be made to paragraph 29 and 30 of the judgment, where the Division Bench has noted the four different branches of Vedas viz., Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, along with the four Upvedas viz., Ayurveda, Gandharvaveda, Dhanurveda and Sthapatyaveda. If all these Vedas are understood in their proper perspective, we can find that they deal with various aspects of life, the way of living, the culture, sculpture, medicines and quintessence of civilization and so on and so forth.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 12\\. The Division Bench has also noted that in Vedas there are formulae, which deals with mathematics. The Vedic sutras enable a person to solve complex mathematical problems because of its cogency, compactness and simplicity. The Division Bench has also stated that it is a total misconception for any one to state that Vedas are only relatable to rituals. It went on to add that mathematicians have observed that while ordinary multiplication methods require many steps, in Sanskrit sutra, only one line method is sufficient. To quote a few, the Division Bench has referred to Urdhwa, Tiryak Sutra, Ekadhiken Purva Sutra and Kalana- Kalna Sutra. A little more detailed analysis made by the Division Bench, as regards the in-depth contents in Vedas can be profitably referred to by extracting paragraph 33 of the judgment of the Division Bench, which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 17: 33. The modern physicists are also connecting certain theories propagated by the ancient Indians. Some scientists have seen atomic dance in the deity of 'Natraj'. The empirical knowledge which has been achieved, had been perceived knowledge which has been achieved, had been perceived by the ancient 'Drastas'. The memories of cells, which is the modern discovery finds place in the wise men of the past. The Psychology, Psychiatry, Neurology had also been adverted in their own way in the Shastras. Presently scholars recognize one continuous shining background which had its base is the pure consciousness.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Thoreau, the eminent thinker, realised this and expressed so through his writing, Psychological quiescence is not unknown to the ancients.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: The principle that there cannot be difference between the body and mind was found by them. The great American, Emerson expressed :\n",
      "Paragraph 20: \"They reckon ill who leave me out; When me they fly I am the wings; I am the doubter and the doubt, And, I the hymn the Brahamana sings.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 21: Possibly for these reasons T.S. Eliot wrote: \"Mankind cannot bear too much of reality.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 13\\. Again in paragraph 43, the Division Bench has highlighted how Vedic learning is also concerned with human anatomy and physiology. It mentions that Atharvaveda gives a picture of human bio-existence in a different manner. It is also stated that Vedas qua human anatomy, coincides more or less with the medical science of today. It is further mentioned that the language of interpretation may be different, but the essence of science is one and the same. The Division Bench states that the Atharvaveda does not perceive mans physiology, as delineated in terms of science, but visualizes in subtler elements, by making specific reference to the nadis, annihilation, exhalation, retention of air in the body, which has its corresponding note in the winds and vayu.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: 14\\. We have ventured to make a detailed reference to the above facets highlighted in the judgment in order to state and understand that by making reference to Vedas and its other allied subjects, one cannot arrive at a conclusion that it only deals with rituals and some religious tenets and that it has nothing to do with other aspects of life. On the other hand, a detailed reference was made by the Division Bench by making an in depth study disclosing that the study of Vedas should enlighten a person in all aspects of life not necessarily restricted to religion or rituals simpliciter.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 15\\. When we attempt to understand the intricacies of Vedas, which as stated by us earlier has been dealt with by the Division Bench in several pages in the opening part of its judgment, we also wish to make a reference to the meaning of the expression Gyan Vigyan, as has been expressed by Dr.Subash Sharma, Dean of Indian Business Academy, Noida in his article From Newton to Nirvana: Science, Vigyan and Gyan. A reading of the said note on Gyan Vigyan by the author really gives a clear picture about the said concept.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: We feel that it is worthwhile to make a brief reference to what has been attempted to be explained by the said author. According to the writer, Gyan Vigyan can be analyzed in two ways, viz., Vishesh Gyan and Vishya Gyan. The world science has linkages with senses and hence, scientific knowledge has got its roots in senses. He would state that the traditional knowledge gets legitimacy only if it can be tested on the basis of objectivity, through the senses. He would elaborate his idea by stating that while science relies on senses, Vigyan i.e. Vishesh Gyan, can be acquired through mind. Therefore, Vigyan is more than science as mind is more than senses. He would conclude his analysis by saying that Gyan both in terms of its metaphysical and spiritual meaning, is acquired through consciousness and that it is more than Vigyan as consciousness is more than mind. If the analysis made by the writer is understood, it can be held that if one represents senses, mind and consciousness in terms of three concentric circles, we may observe that radius of consciousness is larger than the radius of the mind and radius of mind is larger than the radius of the senses.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 16\\. He would therefore, conclude by saying that just as senses, mind and consciousness are interconnected, the three circles of science, Vigyan and Gyan are also interconnected. It can therefore be safely stated that Gyan Vigyan would be nothing but a systematic study of science through senses, by applying ones mind with absolute consciousness.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 17\\. Keeping the above perception about the basics of Vedas i.e., Upvedas, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas etc., in consonance with Gyan Vigyan, it will be necessary to briefly refer as to how the University came to be established after the coming into force of 1995 Act. It is also imminently required in as much as, such an establishment had resulted in the investment of considerable sum of money for the purpose of imparting education on Vedas and its allied subjects, including Gyan Vigyan and for dissemination of knowledge, as was originally thought of by the lawmakers, while enacting 1995 Act for the purpose of establishing the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: 18\\. One of the main themes, which was propagated by Maharshi Mahesh Yogi was that the solution of the problems in the field of education lies in developing the limitless inner potential of its students and teachers.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: According to him, to achieve the said goal, it was necessary to revive the ancient Vedic science and knowledge for the systematic unfolding of the full range of human consciousness. The said line of thinking of the Yogi contains the technology of the unified field that includes the Transcendental Meditation (TM) and Transcendental Meditation Siddhi Programmes. It was also highlighted by the Yogi that there were enough materials in Vedas, which pertains to seed production, crop production, sericulture, health care, management, beauty culture, marketing and accounting. It was further claimed that Vedas are the structure of pure knowledge, having infinite creative potential, which an individual can harvest. In order to highlight the valueability of the above intricate subjects, considerable investment had to be made while establishing the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: 19\\. It was in this background that the Yogi is stated to have made an attempt for nearly four decades by repeatedly knocking at the doors of the Legislators who came forward with the Statute viz., 1995 Act for establishing the institution with the laudable object of spreading the knowledge on Vedas and its intricate subjects, through the medium of education. After the Statute viz., 1995 Act, came into effect, the appellant University took every effort to create the necessary infrastructure of high standards in education and teaching. It is revealed that the infrastructure comprised of permanent furnished buildings, teachers, staff, transport facilities, library, hostel facilities etc., and the capital expenditure as on 31.03.2000, was stated to be Rupees 12.74 crores. Besides this, the recurring expenditure was also of an equal sum.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: After its commencement, it is stated that 3006 students, who received education from the University, were conferred with certificates/diplomas and degrees. In the academic year 2000-01, the student strength was stated to be 3136 and that it has also awarded Ph.D degrees to 10 students, while 70 other students were pursuing their doctorate education by enrolling themselves with the University. Amongst the 70 students who enrolled themselves for pursuing their doctorate courses in the University, 46 students were granted scholarship in the range of Rs.1500 to Rs.2000 per month.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 20\\. In the rejoinder affidavit filed in the High Court, the University further claimed that it has Rs.60 crores deposit and has realized a sum of Rs.2.5 crores by way of tuition fees and stated that the University has invested huge sums for the purpose of imparting education in Vedas, as well as in other science and art subjects, which according to the University were essential requirements to be established for the purpose of attaining its objectives.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 21\\. The appellant University would therefore, contend that in the field of education, though the main objective of the University was to reinforce the greatness of Vedas, Upvedas, agam tantra, itihas, darshan, upanashid, puranas etc., in as much as every other field of education was intrinsically connected with the main objective of spreading the knowledge of Vedas. It was contended that the attempt of the State Government to cripple the activities of the University by restricting the scope of education in the University to Vedas alone would be doing grave injustice to the University, as well as to its beneficiaries.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: 22\\. Having analysed the emergence of the appellant University based on enactment viz., 1995 Act, we are of the considered opinion that it will also be appropriate to emphasis the need of education and its benefits in order to appreciate the issue involved in this litigation in particular to the challenge made at the instance of the appellant to certain of the amendments, which were introduced in the said 1995 Act, by the Amendment Act. It is needless to state that education, a Constitutional right, has been explained as an essential part in every ones life. In order to understand its consequential effects on the society at large, the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, while referring to education has stated, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: Later reinforced by Nelson Mandela Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. The process of learning, as has been highlighted by the father of the nation, emphasises the need for one to have an everlasting thirst for acquiring knowledge by getting himself educated. It is stated that education is the most potent mechanism for the advancement of human beings. It enlarges, enriches and improves the individuals image of the future. A man without education is no more than an animal. Education emancipates the human beings and leads to liberation from ignorance. According to Pestalozzi who is a Swiss pedagogue and educational reformer stated that education is a constant process of development of innate powers of man, which are natural, harmonious and progressive. It is said that in the 21st Century, 'a nation's ability to convert knowledge into wealth and social good through the process of innovation is going to determine its future.' Accordingly the 21st Century is termed as the century of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 23\\. Mr. Will Durrant defines 'education' as the 'transmission of civilization'. George Peabody has defined 'education' as \"a debt due from present to future generations\". Education confers dignity to a man. The significance of education was very well explained by the US Supreme Court first, in the case of Brown V Board of Education  [?CITATION?];[?CITATION?], in following words: \"It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today, it is principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural value, in preparing him for later professional training and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. Hence, it is said that a child is the future of the nation.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: 24\\. A private organization, named the International Bureau of Education, was established in Geneva in 1924 and was transformed into an inter- governmental organization in 1929, as an international coordinating centre for institutions concerned with education. A much broader approach was chosen, however with the establishment of UNESCO in 1945. United Nations, on 10th December, 1998 adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The Preamble to the UDHR stated that: every individual and organ of society...., shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms.... In accordance with the Preamble of UDHR, education should aim at promoting human rights by importing knowledge and skill among the people of the nation States.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 25\\. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares:\n",
      "Paragraph 39: Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and Professional education shall be generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.\" (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 26\\. The same concept has been repeated in the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which seeks to ensure;\n",
      "Paragraph 41: \"Right to free and compulsory education at least in the elementary stages and education to promote general culture, abilities, judgment and sense of responsibility to become a useful member of society and opportunity to recreation, and play to attain the same purpose as of education.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 27\\. The role of international organizations regarding the implementation of the right to education is just not limited to the preparation of documents and conducting conferences and conventions, but it also undertakes the operational programmes assuring, access to education of refugees, migrants, minorities, indigenous people, women and the handicaps. India participated in the drafting of the Declaration and has ratified the covenant. Hence, India is under an obligation to implement such provisions. As a corollary from the Human Rights perspective, constitutional rights in regard to education are to be automatically ensured.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 28\\. Having briefly analyzed the International Conventions, we would like to refer to the provisions in our own Constitution, which provides for the significance and need for education. The Founding Fathers of the nation, recognizing the importance and significance of the right to education, made it a constitutional goal, and placed it under Chapter IV Directive Principles of State Policy of the Constitution of India. Article 45 of the Constitution requires the State to make provisions within 10 years for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 29\\. Further, Article 46 declares that the state shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people. It is significant to note that among several Articles enshrined under Part IV of the Indian Constitution, Article 45 had been given much importance, as education is the basic necessity of the democracy and if the people are denied their right to education, then democracy will be paralyzed; and it was, therefore, emphasized that the objectives enshrined under Article 45 in Chapter IV of the Constitution should be achieved within ten years of the adoption of the Constitution. By establishing the obligations of the State, the Founding Fathers made it the responsibility of future governments to formulate a programme in order to achieve the given goals, but the unresponsive and sluggish attitude of the government to achieve the objectives enshrined under Article 45, belied the hopes and aspirations of the people. However, the Judiciary showed keen interest in providing free and compulsory education to all the children below the age of fourteen years. In the case of [?CITATION?];[?CITATION?], this Court held that right to education is a fundamental right enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. The right to education springs from right to life. The right to life under Article 21 and the dignity of the individual cannot fully be appreciated without the enjoyment of right to education. The Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 45: \"Right to life\" is the compendious expression for all those rights which the Courts must enforce because they are basic to the dignified enjoyment of life. It extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue. The right to education flows directly from right to life. The right to life under Article 21 and the dignity of an individual cannot be assured unless it is accompanied by the right to education. The State Government is under an obligation to make endeavour to provide educational facilities at all levels to its citizens.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 30\\. In the case of [?CITATION?]), this Court was asked to examine the decision of Mohini Jain's case. In Unni Krishnan (supra) this Court partly overruled the decision rendered in Mohini Jains case. The Court held that, the right to education is implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21 and must be interpreted in the light of the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Articles 41, 45 and 46. This Court, however, limited the State obligation to provide educational facilities as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 47: (i) Every Citizen of this Country has a right to free education until he completes the age of fourteen years;\n",
      "Paragraph 48: (ii) Beyond that stage, his right to education is subject to the limits of the economic capacity of the state.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: His Lordship Mr. Justice Mohan, as he then was, has stated as under in paragraph 10 & 11:\n",
      "Paragraph 50: \"10\\. The fundamental purpose of Education is the same at all times and in all places. It is to transfigure the human personality into a pattern of perfection through a synthetic process of the development of the body, the enrichment of the mind, the sublimation of the emotions and the illumination of the spirit. Education is a preparation for a living and for life, here and hereafter.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 11\\. An old Sanskrit adage states: \"That is Education which leads to liberation\"\\- liberation from ignorance which shrouds the mind;\n",
      "Paragraph 52: liberation from superstition which paralyses effort, liberation from prejudices which blind the Vision of the Truth.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 53: (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 54: 31\\. Further, this Court in [?CITATION?], observed that, to develop the full potential of the children, they should be prohibited from doing hazardous work and education should be made available to them. In this regard, the Court held that the government should formulate programmes offering job oriented education, so that they may get education and the timings be so adjusted so that their employment is not affected.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: 32\\. Again in [?CITATION?], Justice K. Ramaswamy and Justice Saghir Ahmad observed that illiteracy has many adverse effects in a democracy governed by a rule of law. It was held that educated citizens could meaningfully exercise their political rights, discharge social responsibilities satisfactorily and develop sprit of tolerance and reform. Therefore, compulsory education is one of the essentials for the stability of democracy, social integration and to eliminate social evils. This Court by rightly and harmoniously construing the provision of Part III and IV of the Constitution has made Right to education a basic fundamental right.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 33\\. The Government of India by Constitutional (86th Amendment Act) Act, 2002 had added a new Article 21A, which provides that \"the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years in such manner as the State may, by law determine\". Further, they strengthened this Article 21A by adding a clause (k) to Article 51-A, which provides for those who are a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his/her child or ward between the age of 6 and 14 years.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: On the basis of the Constitutional mandate provided under Articles 41, 45, 46, 21-A, 51-A(k) and various judgments of this Court, both the Government of India, as well as this Court has taken several steps to eradicate illiteracy, improve the quality of education and simultaneously ensure that the dropouts are brought to nil. Some of these programmes are the National Technology Mission, District Primary Education Programme, and Nutrition Support for Primary Education, National Open School, Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and other state specific initiatives. Besides this, several States have enacted legislations to provide free and compulsory primary education such as: The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, The Kerala Education Act 1959, The Punjab Primary Education Act 1960, The Gujarat Compulsory Primary Education Act 1961, U.P.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: Basic Education Act 1972, Rajasthan Primary Education Act 1964, Tamil Nadu Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011, etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 34\\. The right to education will be meaningful only and only if all the levels of education reach to all sections of people, otherwise it will fail to achieve the target set out by our Founding Fathers, who intended to make the Indian society an egalitarian society.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 35\\. The 15th official census in India was calculated in the year 2011. In a country like India, literacy is the main foundation for social and economic growth. When the British rule ended in 1947, the literacy rate was just 12%. Over the years, India has changed socially, economically, and globally. After the 2011 census, literacy rate in India, during 2011 was found to be 74.04%. Compared to the adult literacy rate here, the youth literacy rate is about 9% higher. Though this seems like a very great accomplishment, it is still a matter of concern that still so many people in India cannot even read and write. The number of children who do not get education especially in the rural areas are still high. Though the government has made a law that every child under the age of 14 should get free education, the problem of illiteracy is still at large.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 36\\. Now, if we consider female literacy rate in India, then it is lower than the male literacy rate, as many parents do not allow their female children to go to schools. They get married off at a young age instead.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: Though child marriage has been lowered to very low levels, it still happens. Many families, especially in rural areas believe that having a male child is better than having a baby girl. So the male child gets all the benefits. Today, the female literacy levels according to the Literacy Rate 2011 census are 65.46%, where the male literacy rate is over 80%. The literacy rate in India has always been a matter of concern, but many NGO initiatives and government ads, campaigns and programs are being held to spread awareness amongst people about the importance of literacy. Also the government has made strict rules for female equality rights. Indian literacy rate has shown a significant rise in the past 10 years.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: 37\\. According to us, illiteracy is one of the major problems faced by the developing nations. In Africa and South East Asia, it has been identified as a major cause of socio economic and ethical conflicts that frequently surfaced in the region. Therefore, literacy has now become part of the Human Right dialogue. Now most of the nations of the world have also accepted their obligation to provide at least free elementary education to their citizens.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 38\\. Owens and Shaw have stated in their book Development Reconsidered It is self-evident that literacy is a basic element of a nationwide knowledge system. The most important element of a literacy program is not the program itself, but the incentive to become and remain literate.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 39\\. Education is thus, viewed as an integral part of national development and held as an instrument by which the skills and productive capacities are developed and endowed. Literacy forms the cornerstone for making the provision of equality of opportunity a reality.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 40\\. With great respect, it will also have to be stated that bereft of improvement in the educational field when we pose to ourselves the question as to what extent it has created any impact, it will have to be stated that we are yet to reach the preliminary level of achievement of standardised literate behaviour. In fact, in the earlier years, though the literate level was not as high as it now stands, the human value had its own respected place in the society. It will be worthwhile to recall the control the elders could administer over the youngsters, de hors the lack of education. It is unfortunate that today education instead of reforming the human behaviour, in our humble opinion appear to have failed to achieve its objective. Instead we find troubled atmosphere in the society at large, which calls for immediate reformation with the efforts of one and all.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: Therefore, it has become imperative to see that the institution, the teachers, the parents, the students and the society at large can do for bringing about such a transformation. When by and large the development of education has been achieved and the percentage of literacy has considerably improved, at least to more than 60%, there should not be any difficulty for the educated mass to prevail upon every section of the society in order to ensure that the orderly society emerges, which would pave the way for a decent and safe living for every human being who is part of the society.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: 41\\. We can usefully refer to the importance of the education as highlighted by the seven Judge Bench of this Court in [?CITATION?], it has been held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 81\\. Education according to Chambers Dictionary is bringing up or training;  strengthening of the powers of body or mind; culture.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: 85\\. Quadri, J. has well put it in his opinion in Pai Foundation:\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 287. Education plays a cardinal role in transforming a society into a civilised nation. It accelerates the progress of the country in every sphere of national activity. No section of the citizens can be ignored or left behind because it would hamper the progress of the country as a whole. It is the duty of the State to do all it could, to educate every section of citizens who need a helping hand in marching ahead along with others.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: 90\\. In short, education is national wealth essential for the nations progress and prosperity.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: 42\\. The following quote of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Unni Krishnans case sums up the importance of education;\n",
      "Paragraph 74: Victories are gained, peace is preserved, progress is achieved, civilisation is built up and history is made not on the battlefields where ghastly murders are committed in the name of patriotism, not in the Council Chambers where insipid speeches are spun out in the name of debate, not even in factories where are manufactured novel instruments to strangle life, but in educational institutions which are the seed-beds of culture, where children in whose hands quiver the destinies the future, are trained. From their ranks will come out when they grow up, statesmen and soldiers, patriots and philosophers, who will determine the progress of the land.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 43\\. Having thus highlighted the importance of Education, when we now refer to the core issue involved in this appeal, the provocation for the appellant to file the writ petition was the amendment introduced by Amendment Act 5 of 2000, by which, Sections 2, 4, 9 and 17 of 1995 Act was amended, while simultaneously Sections 31-A, 31-B, 31-C, 37-A and 37-B were inserted.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 44\\. Before adverting to the consequence of the amendments introduced to two of the crucial provisions viz., Section 4(1) and its proviso and Section 9(2) of the un-amended Act, it will have to be kept in mind that after the coming into force of the 1995 Act, the appellant University has framed its Statutes, as well as Ordinance No.15. Ordinance No.15, contains the courses of studies, which are numerous. Apart from prime subjects on Vedas there were also other professional courses such as Project Management, Human Resources Management, Financial Management, Marketing Management, Accounting and Auditing, Banking, as well as vocational courses in typing, stenography, secretarial practice, computer technology marketing and sales, dress designing and manufacturing, textile designing and printing, horticulture, seed production, crop production, sericulture, as well as, short term courses in various international topics such as, political science, theory of Government, theory of defense, theory of education, theory of management etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 45\\. One other relevant factor to be noted is that the appellant University was added in the list of Universities maintained by the University Grants Commission, as provided under Section 2(f) of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. The same was addressed by way of a communication to the University Grants Commission dated 24.08.1998, in and by which, the inclusion of the appellant University in the schedule to the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 was notified. One other factor which is also to be kept in mind is that by virtue of the provisions contained in the un- amended Act, the appellant University also opened up as many as 55 centers in which an average of 35 students stated to have got themselves enrolled to pursue various courses of study.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: 46\\. Keeping the above factors and details in mind, when we examine the challenge made in the writ petition, in the forefront, the challenge was to the amendment, which was made to Section 4(1) of the 1995 Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: 47\\. The next challenge was to the proviso to Section 4 and the third crucial challenge was to the amendment to Section 9(2) of the 1995 Act. In fact, Mr.Nagaeshwara Rao, learned senior counsel for the appellant in his submissions, mainly concentrated on the above three aspects on which the amendments impinge upon the rights of the appellant.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 48\\. In the first instance, we wish to take up the amendment to Section 4(1) of the Act. In order to appreciate the submissions of the respective counsel, it will be worthwhile to note the un-amended Section 4(1), the amended Section 4(1), as well as the Preamble to the Act which are as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 81: \"4 (i) to provide for instruction in all branches of Vedic learning and practices including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas, Upvedas and Gyan- Vigyan and the promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit as the University may, from time to time determine and to make provision for research and for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 82: The amended provision reads as under:-- \"to provide for instruction only in all branches of Vedic learning and practices including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas, Upvedas and Gyan-Vigyan and the promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit as the University may from time to time determine and to make provison for research and for the advancement in the above fields and in these fields may .........\"\n",
      "Paragraph 83: Preamble:\n",
      "Paragraph 84: \"An Act to establish and incorporate a University in the State of Madhya Pradcsh and to provide for education and prosecution of research in Vedic learnings and practices and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 85: 49\\. A reading of the above amendments to Section 4(1) discloses that by way of the amendment, the expression only and the expression in the above fields and in these fields may were added, while the last set of expressions dissemination of knowledge were deleted. After the amendment, the grievance of the appellant was that, prior to the coming into force of the Amendment Act viz., Act 5 of 2000, the Officer on Special Duty, in the Department of Higher Education, sent a memorandum, alleging that the course of study prescribed in Clause 1(i) and (j) of Ordinance No.15, were contrary to the aims and objectives of the University and therefore, not acceptable. The University submitted through its reply vide Annexure P-7, explaining in detail with cogent reasons as to why it was entitled to conduct those courses. It is in the above stated background that the Amendment Act 5 of 2000 came to be introduced.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: 50\\. In the above stated background, when we examine the amendment to Section 4 (1), it is quite apparent that by adding the word only after the expressions instruction in the opening part of the Section and by adding expression in the above fields and in these fields may, the State Legislature apparently wanted to restrict the scope of providing instructions to its students only in respect of studies in branches of Vedic learning and practices, including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas, Upvedas and Gyan- Vigyan and also the promotion and development of study of Sanskrit, which was left to be determined by the University. It was also entitled to make provisions for research and for the advancement in the fields mentioned above. By omitting or by deleting the set of expression dissemination of knowledge, apparently the State Legislature wanted to give a thrust to its intendment of restricting the scope of study in the appellant University to Vedic instructions and its allied subjects.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: By taking up the deletion of the expression dissemination of knowledge, by way of the amendment as stated earlier, the State Legislature wanted to restrict the scope of study in the appellant University to Vedic instructions alone. The expression dissemination of knowledge is, to put it precisely, the spreading of knowledge over wide frontiers. Going by the dictionary meaning and to put it differently, dissemination of knowledge would mean spreading of knowledge widely or disbursement of knowledge widely. Therefore, the said set of expressions on their own, would only mean any attempt for spreading of knowledge or disbursement of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: With the said set of expressions as originally contained in Section 4(1), the question for consideration was as to whether such spreading of knowledge or disbursement of knowledge should be confined only to the exclusive field of Vedic learning alone, or whether it should be read disjunctively to be applied for such spreading of knowledge, on a wide spectrum. In fact, the Division Bench has even concluded that even by retaining these set of expressions, the position would be that such dissemination of knowledge would be referable only to Vedic learning and not for general application.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: 51\\. Mr. Nageshwar Rao, learned senior counsel in his submissions took pains to contend that by reading the un-amended Section 4(1) by virtue of the word and prior to the set of expressions for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, the learned senior counsel contended that the whole idea and purpose, while establishing the appellant University was for the cause of advancement and spreading of knowledge in a wide spectrum and not by restricting it to the field of Vedic learning alone. To reinforce his submissions, the learned senior counsel vehemently contended that Section 4(1), apart from providing scope for Vedic learning and practices, including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas and Upvedas also used the expression Gyan-Vigyan which is nothing but science and technology. The learned senior counsel therefore, contended that apart from spreading the process of learning in the field of Vedas, the establishment of the appellant University was also in other fields such as, science and technology and other vocational courses, by way of dissemination of knowledge. The learned senior counsel therefore, contended that by bringing out the amendment to Section 4(1), by way of an addition to the expressions only and in the above fields and in these fields may, the State Government has violated the Constitutional right of the appellant in the field of education, thereby conflicting with Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: 52\\. The learned senior counsel further contended that the State Legislature lacks competence, in as much as education is a subject contained in Entry- 66 of List-I and is already governed by the central legislation viz., the [University Grants Commission Act, 1956]  and therefore, the State was incompetent to restrict the scope of education in various fields by bringing out an amendment, as has been made in Act 5 of 2000.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: 53\\. To support the above submission, the learned senior counsel by referring to the Preamble of 1995 Act contended that the Act was enacted to provide for education primarily and prosecution of research in Vedic learning and practices, apart from providing for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The submissions of the learned senior counsel was that going by the Preamble to the enactment, the purport of the legislation was to provide education in all fields in the forefront, apart from prosecution of research in Vedic learning and practices. The learned senior counsel would contend that the said submission was rejected by the Division Bench by restricting the consideration to the words preceding the expression dissemination of knowledge and by applying the principle Noscitur A Sociis. The learned senior counsel would contend that such an approach of the Division Bench was not justified and relied upon the Devi and Ors.).\n",
      "Paragraph 92: 54\\. The learned senior counsel also referred to Section 6 of the Madhya Pradesh University Act, 1973 and contended that dissemination of knowledge is referable to spreading of knowledge in all other fields which may also include Vedic learning. The learned senior counsel also relied State of Chhattisgarh and Ors.) for the proposition as to how to understand the expression and.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: 55\\. Apart from the submission on Section 4(1), the learned senior counsel, while attacking the amendment made by introducing proviso to Section 4, contended that as far as the introduction of various courses, as well as opening of centers are concerned, they are exclusively governed by the University Grants Commission Regulations, which was framed under the provisions of the [University Grants Commission Act, 1956]  and consequently ultra-vires of the Constitutional provisions. The learned senior counsel relied upon [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]. Reference was also made to Section 12 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 in support of the said submission.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: 56\\. As far as the challenge relating to Section 9(2) of the Act, was concerned, the learned senior counsel contended that the submission based on Entry 66 of List-I of the Constitution would equally apply to the said challenge. Besides this, he also contended that as the appellant University was created by a Statute, the amendment only seeks to interfere with its independence by casting onerous conditions on the appellant to submit a panel of three persons to the State Government, and by empowering the State Government to grant its approval as a pre-condition for the appointment of the Chancellor. According to the learned senior counsel such a condition imposed was highly arbitrary and therefore, was liable to be set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: 57\\. The learned senior counsel therefore, contended that the insertion of the word only in Section 4(1) of the Act, was made by simultaneously deleting the expression dissemination of knowledge and thereby, the un- amended provision has been made meaningless. According to the learned senior counsel, the conclusion of the Division Bench that even without the deletion, the position remains the same, was not correct because every word in the legislation has a purpose and the principle Noscitur A Sociis was not applicable to the case on hand because the term dissemination of knowledge is of wider import.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: 58\\. The above proposition of law as contended by the learned senior counsel has been widely dealt with by this Court in a catena of decisions right from [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]. It has been held that the legal maxim Noscitur A Sociis, is merely a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider. It is only where the intention of the Legislature in associating wider words with words of narrower significance is doubtful or otherwise not clear that the present rule of construction namely Noscitur A Sociis can be usefully applied.\n",
      "Paragraph 97: 59\\. As far as the proviso to Section 4 was concerned, the submission of the learned senior counsel was, what applied to the courses would equally apply to centers and since the Division Bench has held that the State Government was not competent to legislate, as regards the courses to be introduced, on the same logic, the Division Bench ought not to have set aside the proviso in its entirety.\n",
      "Paragraph 98: 60\\. As against the above submissions Ms.Vibha Datta Makhija, learned counsel for the State contended that the University Grants Commission Rules was related to the standard of education and not on courses. According to the learned counsel, going by the Preamble to 1995 Act, it is categorical and unambiguous to the effect that the establishment of the University was only to provide education in Vedic learning and therefore, it can only be in courses connected with Vedas. As a corollary it was submitted that any course not connected with Vedic learning will stand excluded.\n",
      "Paragraph 99: 61\\. The learned counsel submitted that even going by the un-amended Section 4, it is clear that it referred only to all learning connected with Vedic study, since the various sub-clauses to Section 4 also disclosed that it was more Vedic centric rather than on general subjects. By referring to Section 17, the learned counsel pointed out that the degree of autonomy granted to the appellant University, as compared to other Universities was limited in scope.\n",
      "Paragraph 100: 62\\. The learned counsel also referred to the object and scope of the Madhya Pradesh Vishwavidyalaya Adhiniyam, 1973 (Act 22 of 1973) in particular to the Objects and Reasons and contended by making reference to the object of the said Act, which purported to consolidate and amend the law relating to Universities and to make better provisions for the organization and administration of Universities in Madhya Pradesh. The learned counsel further contended that the various provisions of the said Act viz., Section 4(17), Section 6 (1) & (8), Sections 7, 12, 24, 25, 26 and 39 provides the required authority to the State Government to regulate the manner of functioning of the Universities in the State of Madhya Pradesh, including the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: 63\\. As far as the legislative competence is concerned, the learned counsel referred to Entries 63 to 66 of List-I, which deals with Co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions. By referring to Entry 32 of List  II, which deals with incorporation and regulation of Universities, as well as Entry 25 of List  III, which again deals with Education, including technical education, medical education and Universities, subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I, the learned counsel contended what was taken away was only co-ordination and determination of standards of education as covered by Entries 63 to 66 and by virtue of the enabling provision in Entry 32 of List-II, which empowers the State Government for incorporating an University and regulating its functioning, ample powers are vested with the State Government to pass the impugned legislation. The learned counsel therefore, contended that Section 4(1) only deals with the scope within which the appellant University can function and that it does not talk about curriculum or standard. In such circumstances, when the said provision empowers the University to set up an institution by regulating the same by taking certain measures, it cannot be held that such an exercise can be questioned on the ground of lack of competence.\n",
      "Paragraph 102: 64\\. The learned counsel would contend that the amendment introduced by the State Government was in public interest, which falls squarely under Entry 32 of List-II, as well as Entry 25 of List-III and therefore, there was no repugnancy with Entry 66 of List-I of the Constitution. In support of the above submission, the learned counsel also referred to Section 2(f) of the [University Grants Commission Act, 1956]  and contended that the definition of the term University under the said Act means a University established or incorporated by or under a Central Act, a Provincial Act or a State Act and therefore, the University which was established under the 1995 Act can always be regulated by the State Government by passing appropriate amendments to the Act by which the State created the said University.\n",
      "Paragraph 103: 65\\. The learned counsel also referred to Section 12 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 to contend that the general duty of the Commission is to take, in consultation with the Universities or other bodies concerned, all such steps as it may think fit for the promotion and co-ordination of University education and for the determination and maintenance of standards of teaching, apart from examination and research in Universities for which it can take certain actions. In support of her submission, the learned counsel relied upon the decisions reported in [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 104: 66\\. The sum and substance of the submissions of the learned counsel for the State was that the state had competence to legislate by introducing the amendments, that the autonomy of the appellant University was also subject to the regulation by the State and that the only thing to be ensured was that such regulatory measures should be reasonable and in consonance with Article 19(1)(j) of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 105: 67\\. On the proviso to Section 4, the learned counsel contended that so long as the Centre is connected with the establishment of University, it would fall under Entry 32 of List-II and therefore, the said proviso was rightly held to be intra-vires by the Division Bench. According to the learned counsel, the effect of the amendment was not a curtailment, but was only by way of clarification. According to the learned counsel to interpret the amendment, the principle of Mischief Rule will have to be applied. The learned counsel further contended that the word and used in the Preamble, as well as under Section (4), will have to be read conjunctively and relied [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] \n",
      "Paragraph 106: 68\\. Having heard the learned senior counsel for the appellant, as well as the learned counsel for the State, and having bestowed our serious consideration to the respective submissions and having perused the scholarly judgment of the Division Bench and other material papers, at the very outset we are of the view that providing education in an University is the primary concern and objective, while all other activities would only be incidental and adjunct. In this context, it would be worthwhile to emphasis the importance of education which has been emphasised in the 'Neethishatakam' by Bhartruhari (First Century B.C.) in the following words: \"Translation: Education is the special manifestation of man;\n",
      "Paragraph 107: Education is the treasure which can be preserved without the fear of loss;\n",
      "Paragraph 108: Education secures material pleasure, happiness and fame; Education is the teacher of the teacher; Education is God incarnate; Education secures honour at the hands of the State, not money; A man without education is equal to animal.\" For this very reason, we have elaborately stated the importance of education as stated by the Father of our Nation, other renowned Authors and great men in public life as well as the mindset of our Constitutional framers in paragraphs 22 to 42. We have also referred to some of the leading judgments of this Court where it has already been held that Right to Education is a Fundamental Right, guaranteed by Article 21 of our Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 109: 69\\. Keeping the said basic principles in mind, when we examine the issue involved in this appeal, the burden of the appellant was that though under Section 4(1), reference to Vedic learning and its allied subjects was made in the opening sentence, the University was not established under the 1995 Act, only for the purpose of imparting education in Vedas alone, but it was intended for spreading the knowledge of Vedas and simultaneously to teach Sanskrit, science and technology and also as specifically mentioned in Section 4, for spreading of knowledge in all fields. In fact, in the pursuit of our above perception, we have quoted extensively the view points of various personalities, as well as the importance of education and the various constitutional provisions, which were incorporated mainly with a view to spread education in the independent India in order to ensure that the Society is enlightened and by such enlightenment the rights of the people and orderly society is ensured in this Country. Also while referring to a decision of this Court rendered in Mamata Mohanty (supra), the importance of imparting education is emphasized as hereunder:\n",
      "Paragraph 110: 29. Education is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given to the young persons in preparation for the work of life. It also connotes the whole course of scholastic instruction which a person has received. Education connotes the process of training and developing the knowledge, skill, mind and character of students by formal schooling. ***\n",
      "Paragraph 111: 33\\. In view of the above, it is evident that education is necessary to develop the personality of a person as a whole and in totality as it provides the process of training and acquiring the knowledge, skills, developing mind and character by formal schooling. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain a high academic standard and academic discipline along with academic rigour for the progress of a nation. Democracy depends for its own survival on a high standard of vocational and professional education. Paucity of funds cannot be a ground for the State not to provide quality education to its future citizens. It is for this reason that in order to maintain the standard of education the State Government provides grant-in-aid to private schools to ensure the smooth running of the institution so that the standard of teaching may not suffer for want of funds.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: 70\\. With the above said prelude, as regards the importance of education in an orderly society, when we come to the core issue, the appellant was aggrieved by the amendment Act 5 of 2000 by which Section 4(1) of 1995 Act was altered and thereby, the State want to contend that the appellant University can impart education only in the field of Vedic learning and practices, including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas and Upvedas.\n",
      "Paragraph 113: Darshan means a proper reading of ones own self and the environment.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: Agam Tantra is oriental research, which includes history and geography.\n",
      "Paragraph 115: Itihas, Puranas as the very words suggest, relates to history. Upvedas are part of Vedas. The section as it originally stood stated that the University can provide education in all branches of Vedic learning and practices, which also mentioned Gyan-Vigyan, as well as promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit as the University may from time to time determine. It also mentioned that the University can make provision for research and for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: 71\\. According to Mr. L. Nageshwar Rao, the learned senior counsel for the appellant, the words and preceding the expression Gyan-Vigyan, the promotion and development of study of Sanskrit, as well as for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, have to be read disjunctively and not conjunctively with the first part of the provision viz., providing for instruction in all branches of Vedic learning.\n",
      "Paragraph 117: 72\\. As against the above submission, Ms. Makhija the learned counsel for the State would contend that having regard to the manner in which the provision has been couched, it will have to be read conjunctively and not disjunctively.\n",
      "Paragraph 118: 73\\. Both the learned counsel referred to the Preamble in support of their submissions. When we refer to the Preamble of the 1995 Act, we find that it has been stated that an Act to establish and incorporate a University in the State of Madhya Pradcsh and to provide for education and prosecution of research in Vedic learnings and practices and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\" Here again, while Mr.Nageshwar Rao the learned senior counsel would contend that the expression and used clearly distinguish each set of expression, according to the learned counsel for the State, the same will have to be read conjunctively.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: 74\\. Having considered the various submissions and the analysis made based on detailed circumstances leading to the intricacies of Vedas, the field it covers, as noted by the Division Bench, as well as the concept of education, which has been explained by very many learned and prominent persons to whom we have made detailed references to in the earlier part of our judgment, we are of the considered view that education is the base for every other subject to be taught in the process of learning. Therefore, establishment of the University as the Preamble goes to state was to provide for education in the forefront. It will be appropriate to hold that such a provision for education in so far as the appellant University was concerned, should concentrate and focus in the prosecution of research in Vedic learning and practices and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. While holding so, it will have to be stated in uncontroverted terms that merely because such specific reference was made to prosecution of research in Vedic learnings, it could be held that the imparting of education in the appellant University should be restricted to the said subject alone and not in any other subject.\n",
      "Paragraph 120: 75\\. In our considered view, such a narrow interpretation would be doing violence to the very basic concept of education, and would create a serious restrain on the University, where, imparting of education is the primary objective and dealing with any specific subject may be for enabling any one to acquire special knowledge on such subjects. In other words, any such restrictive interpretation would go against the basic tenets of the concept of education, which no Court can venture to state.\n",
      "Paragraph 121: 76\\. In this context, we must state that if such a narrow interpretation is sought to be placed, it would even create an embargo in the prosecution of research in Vedic learning and practices. In this context, as has been widely considered and referred to by the Division Bench, which we have also noted, in a precise form in the earlier part of the judgment, we find that Vedas has not left any subject untouched. The Division Bench has noted in paragraphs 20 and 30 the various fields, which have been dealt with and associated in Vedas. The Division Bench has gone to the extent of saying that some scientists have seen the atomic dance in the deity of 'Natraj'.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: It has also been noted that mathematic formulae are much more concise and precise in Vedas. It is said that Vedic learning is concerned with human anatomy and physiology. It was further found that there were enough materials in Vedas, which pertains to seed production, crop production, sericulture, health care, management, beauty culture, marketing and accounting. In fact, according to the Maharshi, who was the man behind the establishment of the appellant University, in order to develop the limitless inner potential of students and teachers, the only solution is education and to achieve that end, according to him, ancient Vedic sciences have to be revived and the knowledge for systematic unfolding the range of human consciousness. In fact, this knowledge was stated to be Maharshi technology of the unified field, which included Transcendental Meditation and Transcendental Meditation Siddhi Programmes. It is also stated that Transcendental Meditation is learnt by more than three million people worldwide and implemented in public and private educational institutions in more than 20 countries through Universities, colleges, schools and educational institutions. Therefore, considering the very purport and intent of the Maharshi, who relentlessly fought for the establishment of the appellant University for nearly four decades and ultimately achieved the said objective for establishing the University, it can never be held that his sole purport was only to spread vedic learning and nothing else.\n",
      "Paragraph 123: Therefore, in that view when we examine the respective submissions of the learned counsel we find force in the submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant when he contended that by virtue of the amendment, the un- amended Section 4(1) will become meaningless and that the very purport of establishing the appellant University would become a futile exercise, if it were to restrict its courses only to mere Vedic learning, without providing scope for learning all other incidental and ancillary subjects dealt with by Vedas viz., all other worldly subjects such as, Project Management, Finance Management, Crop Management, Human Resource Management, mathematics and other sciences for which fundamental basic provisions have been prescribed in Vedas and practices including, Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas and Upvedas.\n",
      "Paragraph 124: 77\\. It will have to be stated that the expression Gyan-Vigyan was specifically mentioned in Section 4(1), not merely to make a scientific study of what is contained in Vedas, as even such a study may not fulfill the purpose for which the University was created. When we think aloud as to what would happen if a scientific study exclusively about Vedas is made, we wonder whether for that purpose a creation of a University would have been necessitated. On the other hand, it is the other way around, in as much as Vedas contains very many scientific subjects such as, mathematics, study about atoms, human anatomy and physiology and other formulae. At this juncture, the inclusion of the expression Gyan-Vigyan, will have to be understood to have been inserted with a view to study modern science and technology as it exists and study the same in consonance with the basic principles contained in Vedas and puranas. In fact, such an approach, while reading the provisions in our considered opinion, would be the proper way of reading the said provisions and not as contended by the learned counsel for the State that the study of Gyan- Vigyan should be exclusively for the purpose of understanding Vedas and Vedic principles. We have earlier explained what is Gyan Vigyan by making reference to an Article From Newton to Nirvana: Science, Vigyan and Gyan by Dr.Subash Sharma, Dean of Indian Business Academy, Noida. Based on the said Article, we have noted that Gyan Vigyan is nothing but a systematic study of science through senses by applying ones mind with absolute consciousness. If it is the meaning to be attributed to the expression Gyan Vigyan, it will have to be held that the said expression used in Section 4(1) cannot be restricted to a mere study on Vedas and its practices. Such a narrow interpretation will be doing violence to the whole concept of Gyan Vigyan, which as explained by Dr. Subash Sharma, is the combination of human senses, mind and consciousness, which should be applied to every aspect of human life, which would include all other academic subjects viz., science, mathematics, philosophy, management, etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 125: 78\\. In this context, when we refer to the expression promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit as the University may from time to time determine, we find that even indisputably the said provision for the study of Sanskrit is totally unconnected to the learning of Vedas and its allied subjects, except that the scripts of Vedas may be in Sanskrit. For that purpose, there need not necessarily be a specific provision to the effect that there should be promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit. Therefore, apart from Vedic learning and its practices, the establishment of the appellant University was for the purpose of providing education in the field of science and technology, intensive learning of Sanskrit and provision for research in every other field for the advancement and disbursement of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: 79\\. We are of the considered opinion that only such an interpretation to the un-amended Section 4(1) would be the only way of interpretation that can be accorded to the said provision. Once, we steer clear of the interpretation of the said provision in the above said manner, we find that the amendment, which was introduced by Act 5 of 2000, was clearly intended to purposely do away with its original intendment and thereby, restrict the scope of activities of the appellant University to the learning of Vedas and its practices and nothing else. The restriction so created by introducing the amendment was self-destructive and thereby, the original object and purpose of establishing the appellant University was done away with. In this context, the framing of the Ordinance 15, which provided for the study on various courses in the appellant University was consciously approved by the State Government without any inhibition. A perusal of the course contents in the Ordinance discloses that there were as many as 49 courses connected with Vedic learning and practices and about 33 courses on other subjects. By introducing the amendment under Act 5 of 2000 and thereby, insisting that imparting of education in the appellant University can be restricted only to Vedic learning and that the science and technology should also be only for the purpose of learning Vedas and its practices, will have to be stated unhesitatingly as creating a formidable restriction on the right to education, which is a guaranteed Constitutional right and thereby, clearly violating Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Equally, the addition of the expression in the above fields and in these fields may.........\" while deleting the expression dissemination of knowledge, in our considered opinion, drastically interfered with the right to education sought to be advanced by the University by its creation originally under the 1995 Act, which restriction now sought to be imposed can never be held to be a reasonable restriction, nor can it be held to have any rationale, while creating such a restriction by way of an amendment to Section 4(1).\n",
      "Paragraph 127: 80\\. Having regard to our fundamental approach to the issue raised in this appeal and our conclusion as stated above, we are convinced that the arguments based on the Legislative competence also pales into insignificance. Even without addressing the said question, we have in as much found that by virtue of the amendment introduced to Section 4(1), an embargo has been clearly created in ones right to seek for education, which is a Constitutionally protected Fundamental Right. Therefore, there was a clear violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution and consequently, such a provision by way of an amendment cannot stand the scrutiny of the Court of Law. To support our conclusion, we wish to refer to the following decisions rendered by this Court, right from Mohini Jain case, viz., (i) [?CITATION?] (ii)[?CITATION?] (iii) [?CITATION?] (iv) [?CITATION?] (v) [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 128: wherein, this Court has consistently held that Right to Education is a Fundamental Right. Thus, our conclusion is fortified by the various judgments of this Court, wherein, it has been held that imparting of education is a Fundamental Right, in as much as, we have held that the establishment of the appellant University was mainly for the purpose of imparting education, while promotion of Vedic learning is one of the primary objectives of the University. Any attempt on the part of the State to interfere with the said main object viz., imparting of education, would amount to an infringement of the Fundamental Right guaranteed under the Constitution. Consequently, the amendment, which was introduced under the 1995 Act to Section 4(1) and also the insertion of the proviso, has to be held ultra-vires.\n",
      "Paragraph 129: 81\\. Having arrived at the above conclusion, when we examine the stand of the State, at the very outset, we are not persuaded to accede to the submission of the learned counsel that the amendment was only by way of a clarification of the existing provision. In fact, the Division Bench also proceeded on the footing that dissemination of knowledge as it originally existed, did not empower the University to provide education to other courses other than Vedas and its practices. With great respect to the Division Bench, we are of the view that such an approach was directly in conflict with the basic principle of the Constitutionally protected Fundamental Right, the Right to Education and consequently the said line of reasoning of the Division Bench and the submissions on that basis cannot also be countenanced.\n",
      "Paragraph 130: 82\\. In fact, in this context, the decision relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent State reported in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] rather than supporting the respondent State can be usefully applied to state that dissemination of knowledge in every respect would apply to any subject and cannot be restricted to any particular subject. In paragraph 30 of the said decision, while concluding as to the role of the University Grants Commission in the matter of academic education, it has been stated as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 131: Dissemination of learning with search for new knowledge with discipline all round must be maintained at all costs. It is hoped that University Grants Commission will duly discharge its responsibility to the Nation and play an increasing role to bring about the needed transformation in the academic life of the University. (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 132: 83\\. The above sentence amply establishes that dissemination of learning is for acquisition of knowledge in every kind of discipline and that such a perception should be maintained at all cost. We therefore, hold that dissemination of knowledge as it originally stood in Section 4(1), which was deleted by way of the Amendment Act 5 of 2000, caused havoc by restricting the scope of acquisition of knowledge to be gathered by an individual from the facilities made available in the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: We make it clear that it can never be held that the said expression used in the un-amended Section 4(1) can be held to have a limited application for acquisition of knowledge on Vedas alone and not in other fields.\n",
      "Paragraph 134: 84\\. As far as the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent based on the expression used in the Preamble was concerned, at the very outset, it will have to be held that the Preamble cannot control the scope of the applicability of the Act. If the provision contained in the main Act are clear and without any ambiguity and the purpose of the Legislation can be thereby duly understood without any effort, there is no necessity to even look into the Preamble for that purpose.\n",
      "Paragraph 135: 85\\. In fact, the Division Bench itself has made reference to a decision of and others etc., reported in AIR 2001 SC 724. The extent to which a Preamble of an Act can be referred to or relied upon has been succinctly stated as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 136: The preamble of an Act, no doubt can also be read along with other provisions of the Act to find out the meaning of the words in enacting provision to decide whether they are clear or ambiguous but the preamble in itself not being an enacting provision is not of the same weight as an aid to construction of a Section of the Act as are other relevant enacting words to be found elsewhere in the Act. The utility of the preamble diminishes on a conclusion as to clarity of enacting provisions. It is, therefore, said that the preamble is not to influence the meaning otherwise ascribable to the enacting parts unless there is a compelling reason for it. If in an Act the preamble is general or brief statement of the main purpose, it may well be of little value. We cannot, therefore, start with the preamble for construing the provisions of an Act, though we could be justified in resorting to it nay we will be required to do so if we find that the language used by Parliament is ambiguous or is too general though in point of fact Parliament intended that it should have a limited application. (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 137: 86\\. The above statement of law makes the position abundantly clear that it is the statutory provision, which will have to be read and analyzed for the purpose of understanding the scope and purport for which the Legislation was intended and the brief statement contained in the Preamble will be of very little value. That apart, we have noted in the earlier part of the judgment as to how even a reading of the Preamble shows the importance attached to imparting of education in the appellant University, as has been highlighted in the forefront while making a mention about the other aspects of providing scope for research oriented education on Vedas and its practices by the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 138: 87\\. In the light of our above discussions, we hold that the submission of the learned counsel for the State by making a detailed reference to the Preamble is of no assistance to the respondents. For the very same reason, the arguments of the learned counsel that any course to be conducted in the appellant University should be Vedic centric cannot also be countenanced.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: On the other hand, as held by this Court in Osmania University case, dissemination of knowledge as originally incorporated in the un-amended Section 4(1) alone would serve the purpose of effective functioning of the appellant University in imparting and spreading knowledge on every other field available, apart from providing intensive educational curriculum in Vedic learning and its practices.\n",
      "Paragraph 140: 88\\. In the light of our above conclusion, the deletion of the said expression will have to be held to be an arbitrary action of the respondent State and thereby, violating equality in law and equal protection of law as enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution, in as much as all other Universities, which were being controlled and administered by the State by the 1973 Act, enjoy the freedom of setting up any course with the approval of the University Grants Commission, the appellant alone would be deprived of such a right and liberty by restricting the scope of imparting education in any field other than Vedas and its practices.\n",
      "Paragraph 141: 89\\. As far as the decision relied upon by the learned counsel for the State for the proposition that the word and in the Preamble, as well as in Section 4 will have to be read conjunctively viz., the decision reported in of Orissa and others), in the light of our conclusions based on the context in which the 1995 Act was brought into force and the reading of Section 4(1) in the said context, the expression and used in the said Section will have to be necessarily read disjunctively. We do not find any scope to apply the said decision to the facts of this case.\n",
      "Paragraph 142: 90\\. As far as the decision reported in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] Bank of find the following paragraph as more relevant in order to appreciate the present controversy with which we are concerned; paragraph 33 reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 143: 33\\. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored.\n",
      "Paragraph 144: Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 145: No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place. (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 146: 91\\. Reading the said paragraph and having analyzed the 1995 Act on the whole along with the Preamble, the various definition clauses, Section 4(1) and the sub-clauses (ii) to (xxviii) and the provision providing for enacting the Statutes and Ordinances, we have to hold that the expression and used in Section 4(1) will have to be read disjunctively and not conjunctively. In this context, we wish to rely on the decision rendered by this Court in Prof. Yashpal and another (supra), wherein, it has been held in paragraph 17 as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 147: 17. In Constitutional Law of India by Seervai, the learned author has said in para 2.12 (3rd Edn.) that the golden rule of interpretation is that words should be read in their ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning subject to the rider that in construing words in a Constitution conferring legislative power the most liberal construction should be put upon the words so that they may have effect in their widest amplitude. This is subject to certain exceptions and a restricted meaning may be given to words if it is necessary to prevent a conflict between two exclusive entries. (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 148: 92\\. Besides the above two decisions, which discuss about the methodology of interpretation of a Statute, we also refer to the following decisions rendered by this Court in Ishwar Singh Bindra (supra), wherein in para 11 it has been held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 149: 11..It would be much more appropriate in the context to read it disconjunctively. In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 3rd Edn. it is stated at p. 135 that and has generally a cumulative sense, requiring the fulfillment of all the conditions that it joins together, and herein it is the antithesis of or. Sometimes, however, even in such a connection, it is, by force of a contexts, read as or. Similarly in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 11th Edn., it has been accepted that to carry out the intention of the legislature it is occasionally found necessary to read the conjunctions or' and and' one for the other.(Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 150: 93\\. We may also refer to para 4 of the decision rendered by this Court in Quarries (P) Ltd.,) :\n",

The High Court overlooked the fact that the use of the negative language in each of the three clauses implied that the word and used at the end of clause (b) had to be read disjunctively. That construction of ours is in keeping with the legislative intent manifested by the scheme of the Act which is primarily meant for ensuring the safety of workmen employed in the mines.

      "Paragraph 152: 94\\. Applying the ratio as laid down in the above mentioned decisions, we are convinced that our above conclusion is fully supported by the said principles and therefore, we are not inclined to hold that the expression and used in the Preamble, as well as in Section 4 should be read conjunctively as contended by the learned counsel for the State. On the other hand, in the context in which the said expression is used, it will have to be read as or creating a disjunctive reading of the provision.\n",

Before we embark upon an inquiry as to what would be the correct interpretation of Section 28-A, we think it appropriate to bear in mind certain basic principles of interpretation of a statute.

The words themselves alone do, in such case, best declare the intention of the lawgiver. It is no doubt true that if on going through the plain meaning of the language of statutes, it leads to anomalies, injustices and absurdities, then the court may look into the purpose for which the statute has been brought and would try to give a meaning, which would adhere to the purpose of the statute\n",

The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant before the Division Bench, as well as before us was that the creation of courses, as well as the centers are governed by the provisions of 1995 Act and such activities of the appellant University can at best be regulated only by the University Grants Commission, by virtue of the statutory prescription under Section 12 of the [University Grants Commission Act] , read along with Entry 66 of List-I of the Constitution and that the State Legislature has no competence to deal with the said issue.\n",

While dealing with the above contention, the Division Bench after making a detailed reference to various Entries commencing from Entries 63 to 66 of List-I, as well as Entry 25 of List-III and also Section 12 of the Universities Grants Commission Act, 1956 ultimately held that having regard to the inclusion of the appellant University in the list of Universities maintained by the Commission under Section 2(f) of the 1956 Act, as reflected in Annexure P-5, dated 24.08.1988, the existence of Ordinance 15, which came into being in accordance with law that once the University Grants Commission Act is in force, the running of the courses and determination thereof, has to be controlled by the University Grants Commission.

The restriction is so far as it related to conduct of courses is concerned, the same was beyond the Legislative competence of the State Legislature. So holding thus, the Division Bench declared that the proviso so far as it related to the aspect that no course should be conducted and run without the prior approval of the State, was ultra vires and beyond the Legislative competence of the State Legislature.\n",
      "Paragraph 162: 100\\. This Court in Prof. Yashpal and another (supra) held in paragraphs 28, 33 and 34 as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 163: 28. Though incorporation of a university as a legislative head is a State subject (Entry 32 List II) but basically a university is an institution for higher education and research. Entry 66 of List I is coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions. There can thus be a clash between the powers of the State and that of the Union. The interplay of various entries in this regard in the three lists of the Seventh Schedule and the real import of Entry 66 of List I have been examined in several decisions of this Court. In Gujarat University v. Krishna Ranganath Mudholkar a decision by a Constitution Bench rendered prior to the Forty-second Amendment when Entry 11 of List II was in existence, it was held that Items 63 to 66 of List I are carved out of the subject of education and in respect of these items the power to legislate is vested exclusively in Parliament. The use of the expression subject to in Item 11 of List II of the Seventh Schedule clearly indicates that the legislation in respect of excluded matters cannot be undertaken by the State Legislatures. In AIR para 23, the Court held as under: (SCR pp. 137-38) Power of the State to legislate in respect of education including universities must to the extent to which it is entrusted to the Union Parliament, whether such power is exercised or not, be deemed to be restricted. If a subject of legislation is covered by Items 63 to 66 even if it otherwise falls within the larger field of education including universities power to legislate on that subject must lie with Parliament.  Item 11 of List II and Item 66 of List I must be harmoniously construed. The two entries undoubtedly overlap: but to the extent of overlapping, the power conferred by Item 66 List I must prevail over the power of the State under Item 11 of List II. It is manifest that the excluded heads deal primarily with education in institutions of national or special importance and institutions of higher education including research, sciences, technology and vocational training of labour. ***\n",
      "Paragraph 164: 33\\. The consistent and settled view of this Court, therefore, is that in spite of incorporation of universities as a legislative head being in the State List, the whole gamut of the university which will include teaching, quality of education being imparted, curriculum, standard of examination and evaluation and also research activity being carried on will not come within the purview of the State Legislature on account of a specific entry on coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical education being in the Union List for which Parliament alone is competent. It is the responsibility of Parliament to ensure that proper standards are maintained in institutions for higher education or research throughout the country and also uniformity in standards is maintained.\n",
      "Paragraph 165: 34\\. In order to achieve the aforesaid purpose, Parliament has enacted the [University Grants Commission Act]  is illustrative and consequently it is being reproduced below:\n",
      "Paragraph 166: The Constitution of India vests Parliament with exclusive authority in regard to coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions. It is obvious that neither coordination nor determination of standards is possible unless the Central Government has some voice in the determination of standards of teaching and examination in universities, both old and new. It is also necessary to ensure that the available resources are utilised to the best possible effect. The problem has become more acute recently on account of the tendency to multiply universities. The need for a properly constituted Commission for determining and allocating to universities funds made available by the Central Government has also become more urgent on this account. (Emphasis added) 101\\. In yet another decision, this Court has held in para 7 of the decision reported in R. Chitralekha (supra) as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 167: 7. This and similar other passages indicate that if the law made by the State by virtue of entry 11 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution makes impossible or difficult the exercise of the legisiative power of the Parliament under the entry \"Co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions\" reserved to the Union, the State law may be bad. This cannot obviously be decided on speculative and hypothetical reasoning. If the impact of the State law providing for such standards on entry 66 of List I is so heavy or devastating as to wipe out or appreciably abridge the central field, it may be struck down. But that is a question of fact to be ascertained in each case.\n",
      "Paragraph 168: 102\\. While considering the submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant, it will be worthwhile to make a reference to Section 12 of the [University Grants Commission Act, 1956]  wherein while describing the functions of the University Grants Commission, it has been stipulated that it is the general duty of the Commission to take, in consultation with the Universities or other bodies concerned, all such steps as it may think fit for the promotion and co-ordination of University education and for the determination and maintenance of standards of teaching, examination and research in Universities, and for the purpose of performing its functions under this Act, the Commission may hold certain enquiry and do certain other activities. In fact, the Division Bench while holding that conduct of courses come exclusively within the realm of control of the University Grants Commission, apparently relied upon the said provision.\n",
      "Paragraph 169: 103\\. In fact the Division Bench has made a specific reference to the expression used in the said Section, while ultimately holding that it was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University Grants Commission i.e., the running of the Courses. The Division Bench has held to the effect we have no hesitation in our mind that once the University Grants Commission Act is in force, the running of the courses and determination thereof has to be controlled by the University Grants Commission. The said sets of expressions have been more or less borrowed from the expression used in Section 12 itself.\n",
      "Paragraph 170: 104\\. When we examine the ultimate conclusion of the Division Bench that such a control by the University Grants Commission will not extend to the running of the centers, we are of the considered view that what all may apply to conduct of courses, should equally apply to the running of centers as well. In this context, it will be worthwhile to make a further reference to the stipulation contained in Section 12 of the University Grants Commission Act, which makes the position clear. Under Section 12, the general duty of the Commission to take in consultation with the Universities or other bodies is concerned, is all such steps as it may think fit for the promotion and co- ordination of University education and for the determination and maintenance of standards of teaching, examination and research in Universities. It also further stipulates that such a decision should be taken by the University Grants Commission for the purpose of the Universities to perform its functions under the Act. The Division Bench itself has noted that the running of the courses and determination thereof, can be controlled only by the University Grants Commission by virtue of the operation of Section 12. If it is for the University Grants Commission to take a decision in consultation with the Universities, such steps as it thinks fit for the promotion and co- ordination of Universities education, then it will have to be held that, that it should include, apart from the course content, the manner in which education is imparted viz., the process of teaching, while at the same time ensuring the standard of such teaching is maintained by deciding as to whether such teaching process can be allowed to be imparted in places other than the University campus viz., in the centers or other colleges.\n",
      "Paragraph 171: 105\\. In our considered opinion, Section 12 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 would encompass apart from determining the course contents with reference to which the standard of teaching and its maintenance is to be monitored by the University Grants Commission, would also include the infrastructure that may be made available, either in the University or in other campuses, such as the centers, in order to ensure that such standard of education, teaching and examination, as well as research are maintained without any fall in standrard. Therefore, while upholding the conclusion of the Division Bench that it is beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature to stipulate any restriction, as regards the conduct of the courses by getting the approval of the State Government, in the same breath, such lack of competence would equally apply to the running of the centers as well.\n",
      "Paragraph 172: 106\\. In Dr. Preeti Srivastava (supra) while dealing with the scope of Entry 66 of List-I vis-a-vis Entry 25 of List-III, this Court considered on what basis the standard of education in an institution can be analyzed. In paragraph 36, it has been held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 173: 36.. Standards of education in an institution or college depend on various factors. Some of these are:\n",
      "Paragraph 174: (1) The caliber of the teaching staff; (2) A proper syllabus designed to achieve a high level of education in the given span of time; (3) The student- teacher ratio; (4) The ratio between the students and the hospital beds available to each student; (5) The caliber of the students admitted to the institution; (6) Equipment and laboratory facilities, or hospital facilities for training in the case of medical colleges; (7) Adequate accommodation for the college and the attached hospital; and (8) The standard of examinations held including the manner in which the papers are set and examined and the clinical performance is judged. 107\\. The above statement of law on Entry 66 of List-I vis-a-vis Entry 25 of List-III throws much light on this issue. For instance, in the case of the appellant, while it has got its own infrastructure facilities for imparting education on various courses spelt out in Ordinance 15, which has opened up centers in various places falling within its jurisdiction viz.\n",
      "Paragraph 175: the State of Madhya Pradesh for imparting education on the very same courses specified in Ordinance 15. If we apply the principle spelt out in paragraph 36 of the above decision, where the standard for examining the standard on education of an University, the various factors culled out in the said paragraph can be held to be the factors to be considered. In the same line of reasoning, it will have to be held that the various centers created by the appellant University, would also fall as one of the items along with the eight items spelt out in the said paragraph.\n",
      "Paragraph 176: 108\\. In the light of the said reasoning also, it will have to be held that the running of centers by the appellant University would fall within the exclusive realm of Entry 66 of List  I, which would in turn be governed by Section 12 of the [University Grants Commission Act]  and consequently the State Government to that extent should be held to lack the necessary legislative competence to meddle with such centers set up by the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 177: 109\\. We therefore, hold that the entire proviso to Section 4(1) has to be held to be ultra-vires. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant therefore, merits acceptance and the contention to the contrary made by the learned counsel for the State stands rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 178: 110\\. It is also necessary to note, as well as mention that after the University was established for its initial establishment and for running the institution, according to the appellant, more than Rs.12 crores were spent by way of an investment and that nearly Rs.60 crores have been spent for running the University and its various centers throughout the State of Madhya Pradesh. The recurring expenditure was stated to be Rs.11 crores.\n",
      "Paragraph 179: Therefore, when the appellant University has proceeded to establish its institution for the purpose of imparting education by making huge investments, a major part of which would have definitely come by way of fees collected from the students who had joined the institution aspiring for improving their educational career, in our considered opinion, it is the responsibility of the State to ensure that such high expectation of the students who joined the appellant university is not impaired and that for whatever expenses incurred by the students, appropriate returns should be provided to them by way of imparting education in the respective fields which, they choose to associate themselves by getting themselves admitted in the appellant University. Therefore, on this ground as well, it will have to be held that such expectations of the students, as well as their parents cannot be dealt with so very lightly by the State, while considering for any change to be brought about in the Constitution and functioning of the appellant University. It can therefore be validly held that such expectations of the students and their parents, as well as that of the appellant University, can validly be held to be a legitimate expectation and considering the challenge made to the amendment introduced on various grounds raised at the instance of the appellant, the legitimate expectation of the appellant University, as well as the student community, would also equally support the contentions of the appellant University, while challenging the amendments in particular the amendment introduced to Section 4(1), as well as the addition of a proviso to the said Section.\n",
      "Paragraph 180: 111\\. One other relevant factor which is also to be kept in mind is the establishment of the appellant University at the repeated persuasion of Maharshi Mahesh Yogi was definitely to provide full-fledged education on Vedas and the various intricate subjects, which are found in Vedas, as well as its practices, Ithihas, Puranas etc. In fact, there can be no two opinion that such an institution with such a laudable objective for imparting education in different fields based on the teachings in Vedas, was very rare and it is said that the appellant University is stated to be an unique University created and established by the founders of the said institution headed by Maharshi Mahesh Yogi. Therefore, when such a premium University, which is stated to be only one of its kind in the whole of the Country was successfully established based on the 1995 Act, in our considered opinion, such a well established institution should be allowed to survive by enabling the said University to conduct courses as has been planned by it and introduced under Ordinance 15 and thereby, make the appellant University a viable one. Such an approach alone, in our considered view, ensure the successful existence and continued running of the University in the further years and thereby, benefit very many aspirants from among the younger generation who wish to learn more and more about very many subjects by understanding such subjects based on the teachings that are found and established in Vedic learnings, its practices, Ithihas and Puranas etc. Therefore, on this ground as well, in our considered opinion, any attempt made from any quarters, which would disrupt the running of the appellant University, will only amount to interfering with its various Constitutional rights and fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. Therefore, when such interference is brought to the notice of this Court, the Court has to necessarily come to the rescue of the appellant University by saving it from any such onslaught being made on its continued existence. We, therefore, find force in the submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant while attacking the amended Section 4(1) and its proviso, by which the appellant University was deprived of its valuable right to hold very many programmes in the conduct of the course enumerated in its Ordinance 15, which consequently resulted in violation of its Constitutional, as well as Fundamental Rights in the running of its educational institutions.\n",
      "Paragraph 181: 112\\. With this, we come to the last part of the submission made on behalf of the appellant, which related to the amendment to Section 9(2) of the 1995 Act. Under the un-amended provision, after the first Chancellor viz., Maharshi Mahesh Yogi, the Board of Management was empowered to appoint the Chancellor from among the persons of eminence and renowned scholar of Vedic education who can hold office for a term of five years and who would be eligible for reappointment. Under the amended Section 9(2), it was stipulated that after the first Chancellor, the Board of Management should prepare and submit a panel of three persons to the State Government and out of the panel, one person should be appointed as Chancellor by the Board of Management, after obtaining the approval of the State Government. As far as the period of holding office was concerned, there was no change in its terms. The Division Bench while considering the said amendment introduced under Act 5 of 2000, has held that even after the amendment, the Management had the power of recommendation and they can recommend a person of eminence and renowned scholar of Vedic education and even if the ultimate appointment is to be made with the approval of the State Government, since any such appointment can be only from the panel prepared by the Board of management, such a stipulation contained in the amendment does not in any way impinge upon any right, much less the Constitutional Right or Fundamental Right of the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 182: 113\\. Having bestowed our serious consideration to the above conclusion of the Division Bench, we do not find anything wrong with the said conclusion.\n",
      "Paragraph 183: We also hold that the said provision does not in any way offend Article 14 of the Constitution, nor does it affect the autonomy of the appellant University. Apart from the above challenges, no other submission relating to the other amended provisions were seriously argued before us.\n",
      "Paragraph 184: 114\\. In the light of our above conclusion, this appeal is partly allowed.\n",
      "Paragraph 185: We hold that the amended Section 4(1) under Act 5 of 2000 inclusive of the introduction of proviso to the said Section is ultra-vires of the Constitution and the same is liable to be set aside. In other respects, the judgment of the Division Bench stands confirmed. The application for intervention considered, no merits, the same is dismissed.\n"

      "Paragraph 1: Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: 1\\. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court setting aside the judgment of acquittal recorded by learned Principal, Assistant Sessions Judge, Tirunelveli. The appellant faced trial along 1 with one Velliah for alleged commission of offences punishable under Section 307 and 307 read with Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short `IPC'). Though the trial Court found that the prosecution has not established the case, in appeal filed by the State it was held by the High Court that the prosecution established the accusations against the appellants. But the acquittal so far as the Velliah A3 is concerned, the High Court confirmed the acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 2\\. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 4: Sankaralingam (PW1), Ramaiah (PW2) and Paramasivam (PW6) are brothers. They reside at Marugal Kurichi village.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: Accused 1 to 3 are also residing in the same village. Their house is situated very near to the house of PWs. 1, 2 and 6.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: Accused 1 and 2 are brothers.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: On 2.10.1989 at about 5.00 p.m. Kannammal, the mother of PWs. 1 and 2 went to the corner of the street to collect water from the common water pipe. The third 2 accused's wife Manickam also came to take water. While collecting water from the common pipe, there was a quarrel between Kannammal and Manickam, the wife of third accused. Ramaiah (PW 2) who noticed this, went there and separated them and took his mother to his house.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: Next day i.e. 3.10.1989 at about 7.30 a.m. Ramaiah (PW.2), Sankaralingam (PW.1) and one Manickam, wife of another brother, went to the well, which is situated in Nallakannau Thevar's garden, in order to take bath. When the first accused came to know about the occurrence which took place on the earlier day, he had grievance against PW.2 thinking that PW.2 abused the wife of the third respondent in support of his mother.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: At about 7.30 a.m. when PWs. 1 and 2 and another went near the well, A1 to A3 waylaid them. A1 and A2 were having `Aruval' with them. A3 caught hold of PW.2 from behind his back. At that time, A1 and A2 with `Aruval' attacked PW.2 indiscriminately on the back, left shoulder, right shoulder, 3 hands, etc. PW.2 received number of bleeding injuries all over the body and began to cry. Sankaralingam (PW.1) and Poolu Thevar (PW.5) and two others went near the injured. The accused persons threatened them that they would kill them also. PW.2 swooned and fell on the ground. Thereafter, the accused took to their heels.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: PWs. 1 and 5 took the victim in a car to Naguneri Government Hospital at about 8.30 a.m. Dr. Andiappan (PW.3) examined the victim and found nine injuries. He also sent Ex.P-2 intimation to the Nanguneri Police Station. Head Constable (PW.7) came and recorded statement from PW.1.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: Ex.P-1 is the complaint and the same was registered against the accused for the offences under Sections 341, 342 and 307 IPC. Ex.P-7 is the printed FIR. Doctor (PW.3) sent the victim to the Tirunelveli Hospital for further treatment. He issued Ex.P-3 wound certificate. Doctor (PW.4) took X-Ray and issued Ex.P-4 X-Ray report and the X-Rays were marked as M.Os. 3 to 9\\.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 4 Gnana Diraviyam (PW.8), the Inspector of Police, took up further investigation and went to the scene and examined the witnesses. He prepared Ex.P-5 observation mahazar and Ex.P-8 rough sketch. He also recovered sample earth and blood stained earth. Thereafter, he went to the hospital and recorded the statement from PW.2. Since the PW.8 was subsequently transferred, Periasamy (PW.9) another Inspector of Police, took up further investigation.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 3\\. After completion of investigation charge sheet was filed and the accused persons faced trial as they denied the accusations. Nine witnesses were examined to further the prosecution version. Trial court found the evidence of prosecution witnesses to be not cogent and credible and accordingly directed acquittal. State preferred appeal against acquittal. High Court found that the reasoning indicated by the Trial Court to direct the acquittal cannot be maintained. It is to be noted that the acquittal was directed by the Trial Court, inter alia, on the following grounds:\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 5 (i) Recording of Ex.P-1 statement given by PW.1 by PW.7 is doubtful. According to PW.3 Doctor, the injured was conscious, when he was admitted in the hospital. PWs. 1 and 7 would state that the complaint was given by PW.1 which was recorded by PW.7, since PW.2 was unconscious. There is no reason as to why PW.7 had to obtain Ex.P-1 complaint from PW.1, when PW.2 was conscious.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: (ii) PW.1 could not have seen the occurrence. PW.5, an independent eye witness, would state that PW.1 came to the scene only after the occurrence.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: Therefore, the evidence of PW.1 is unreliable.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: (iii) PW.6 stated in the court that he had also seen the occurrence. According to PW.8, the investigating officer, PW.6 was not the eye-witness and he did not give any statement that he saw the occurrence.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Therefore, the evidence of PW.6 is unreliable.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: (iv) PW.7 head constable recorded Ex.P-1 and the same was written by him. But, in evidence, he would state that he dictated to a constable and the said constable had written the same. There is no evidence to show that any constable accompanied PW.7. Therefore PW.7 had not recorded Ex.P-1 at the hospital.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: (v) PW.5 an independent witness, would state that A1 and A2 alone were present and attacked PW.2. He did not refer about A3. Therefore, A3 could not have been present. Furthermore, A3 produced a certificate alongwith his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. to show that during the relevant time, he was working in the mill in which he was employed.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 6 (vi) Both in Ex.P-1 and in the evidence of PWs.1 and 2, there is a reference about one Thangapandi stating that he was also one of the eye-witnesses. The said eye-witness was not examined. There is no reason for his non-examination.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: (vii) According to PWs.1 and 2, both A1 and A2 attacked PW.2 indiscriminately. But according to PW.5, after first cut, PW.2 ran to a distance of about 50 feet and thereafter, the further cuts given by the accused with `Aruval\" fell on PW.2 victim. So, there is a contradiction between the evidence of PWs.1 and 2 on the one side and the evidence of PW.5 on the other side.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: 4\\. High Court found that the conclusions arrived at by the Trial Court were not sustainable. After analyzing the evidence of PWs. 1, 2 and 5 it was held that the accusations have been established. Accordingly, the appellants were convicted for the offence punishable under Section 307 IPC and each was sentenced to undergo RI for four years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- with default stipulation.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 5\\. In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Trial Court had rightly rejected the prosecution version taking note of the fact that evidence of 7 PWs 1, 2 and 5 are irreconcilable. It was also submitted that the evidence of PWs. 1, 2 and 5 is contradictory to each other.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: In any event, it was submitted that the injuries were on non- vital parts and, therefore, Section 307 IPC has no application.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, supported the judgment of the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 6\\. PW3- the doctor attached to the Naguneri Government Hospital, Tenkasi examined PW 2 at about 8.15 a.m. on 3.10.1989. He issued the wound certificate ExP3. He found the following injuries on him:\n",
      "Paragraph 28: \"i. A bleeding lacerated wound 10cm x 5 cm. x 4cm on medical aspect of right forearm muscles and (NC) exposed.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: ii. A bleeding lacerated wound 3 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm in middle right forearm.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: iii. A lacerated bleeding wound in the palman aspect of 2 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm of right middle and index finger 8 seen and lacerated wound on the tip of right ring and little finger measuring 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm .\n",
      "Paragraph 31: iv. An incised wound 3 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm in upper aspect of right arm.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: v. A bleeding lacerated wound in the left shoulder outer to the lateral end of left collar bone 4 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm seen.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: vi. A bleeding incised wound in the upper part of left arm 3 cm x 1cm x = cm.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: vii. A bleeding incised wound 15 cm x 6 cm x 4 cm left side of back of chest just below left infrascapular angle.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: viii. A bleeding incised wound in the palman aspect of left index middle and ring finger and thumb each measured 6 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm fracture of middle finger MCP joint.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: ix. A bleeding lacerated wound in the lateral aspect of left forearm 3 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: 9 As per the wound certificate Ex.P3, injury No.3 and 9 is grievous in nature and the other injuries are simple injuries.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 7\\. So far as the evidence of PWs. 1, 2 and 5 is concerned, it is clear that P.W.2 was indiscriminately attacked by Al and A2 with 'Aruval'. As a result of those injuries, the victim (P.W.2) fell on the ground.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 8\\. According to P.W.5, as soon as P.W.2 fell on the ground, he became unconscious and thereafter, the accused persons ran away from the scene. This occurrence took place at about 7.30 A.M. and the victim was taken to the hospital at about 8.15 A.M. P.W.3 Doctor stated that the victim was conscious and the victim stated to him that the he was attacked by three persons with 'Aruval'.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 9\\. P.W. 3 Doctor further stated that he gave Ex.P-2 intimation to the police, when P.W. 2 was admitted in the 10 hospital. On receipt of Ex.P-2, P.W.7 Head constable rushed to Nanguneri Government hospital. At that time, P.W.1 was present in the hospital and gave Ex. P-1 statement to P.W.7.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 10\\. It is true that P.W.7 stated that he obtained Ex.P-1 complaint from P.W.1, when P.W.2 was unconscious. P.W.1 stated that when P.W.2 victim was taken to the hospital, he was in unconscious state and after admitting the victim in the hospital, P.W. 3 Doctor gave treatment to him. So, when treatment was being given by P.W.3 Doctor, P.W.7 came and at that time, he was informed by P.W. 1 that P.W. 2 was not in a position to give statement, since he was unconscious.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 11\\. Even assuming that P.W.2 was conscious at that time, the nine serious injuries found on various parts of the body of the victim would clearly show that he could not have been able to give full details to P.W.7. Under those circumstances, obtaining of Ex. P-1 complaint from P.W. 1 is quite proper.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 11\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 12\\. Merely because P.W.2 was conscious at that time, it cannot be said that the statement should not have been recorded from P.W.1 and the same is doubtful. No law prohibits the police officer from recording complaint relating to the occurrence, that too, from an eye witness. The ground of acquittal as recorded by trial Court is not at all a proper ground.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 13\\. Secondly, accordingly to the trial court, P.W. 1 could not have been seen the occurrence.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 14\\. This again is not the reasoning based on evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: According to both P.Ws. 1 and 2, they went to take bath in the well one after another. P.W.5 stated that after hearing the cry of P.W.2, P.W.1 and others came to the scene. This would not mean that P.W.1 did not accompany P.W.2. As a matter of fact, even according to P.W.5, P.Ws. 1 and 5 took the victim in a taxi to Naguneri Hospital.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 12 15\\. The occurrence took place in a day light at 7.30 A.M.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: The house of accused and P.Ws. 1 & 2 are situated nearby and the well also is situated just two furlongs away from the village. Under those circumstances, it cannot be said that P.W.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 1 could not have accompanied P.W.2 to take bath. Therefore, this ground of acquittal was rightly held by the High Court to be untenable.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 16\\. We find that the analysis made by the High Court to set aside the order does not suffer from any infirmity. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that an appeal against the acquittal cannot be interfered by the Appellate Court except for the compelling reasons.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: 17\\. The appellants have questioned the correctness of the High Court's judgment. According to them, the High Court had not kept in view the parameters of appeal against acquittal. It is submitted that even if two views are possible, the view supporting the accused had to be accepted and since 13 the trial Court had precisely done it and there was no reason to interfere with the judgment of the trial Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 18\\. In view of rival submissions of the parties, we think it proper to consider and clarify the legal position first. Chapter XXIX (Sections 372-394) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as \"the present Code\") deals with appeals. Section 372 expressly declares that no appeal shall lie from any judgment or order of a criminal court except as provided by the Code or by any other law for the time being in force. Section 373 provides for filing of appeals in certain cases. Section 374 allows appeals from convictions. Section 375 bars appeals in cases where the accused pleads guilty.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: Likewise, no appeal is maintainable in petty cases (Section 376).\n",
      "Paragraph 55: 19\\. Section 377 permits appeals by the State for enhancement of sentence. Section 378 confers power on the State to present an appeal to the High Court from an order of 14 acquittal. The said section is material and may be quoted in extenso:\n",
      "Paragraph 56: \"378\\. Appeal in case of acquittal :(1) Save as otherwise provided in sub- section (2) and subject to the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (5), 2 [(a) the District Magistrate may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an Appeal to the Court of Session from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence;\n",
      "Paragraph 57: (b) the State Government may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an Appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of an acquittal passed by any Court other than a High Court [not being an order under clause (a)] or an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Session in revision.\";].\n",
      "Paragraph 58: (2) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case in which the offence has been investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946) or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an offence under any Central Act other than this Code, 3 [the Central Government may, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), also direct the Public Prosecutor to present an Appeal-- 15 (a) to the Court of Session, from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence;\n",
      "Paragraph 59: (b) to the High Court from an original or appellate order of an acquittal passed by any Court other than a High Court [not being an order under clause (a)] or an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Session in revision].\n",
      "Paragraph 60: (3) No Appeal under sub-section (1) or sub- section (2) shall be entertained except with the leave of the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: (4) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon complaint and the High Court, on an application made to it by the complainant in this behalf, grants special leave to Appeal from the order of acquittal, the complainant may present such an Appeal to the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: (5) No application under sub-section (4) for the grant of special leave to Appeal from an order of acquittal shall be entertained by the High Court after the expiry of six months, where the complainant is a public servant, and sixty days in every other case, computed from the date of that order of acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: (6) If, in any case, the application under sub- section (4) for the grant of special leave to Appeal from an order of acquittal is refused, no Appeal from that order of acquittal shall lie under sub- section (1) or under sub-section (2).\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 16\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 20\\. Whereas Sections 379-380 cover special cases of appeals, other sections lay down procedure to be followed by appellate courts.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 21\\. It may be stated that more or less similar provisions were found in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter referred to as \"the old Code\") which came up for consideration before various High Courts, Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as also before this Court. Since in the present appeal, we have been called upon to decide the ambit and scope of the power of an appellate court in an appeal against an order of acquittal, we have confined ourselves to one aspect only i.e. an appeal against an order of acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 22\\. Bare reading of Section 378 of the present Code (appeal in case of acquittal) quoted above, makes it clear that no restrictions have been imposed by the legislature on the powers of the appellate court in dealing with appeals against 17 acquittal. When such an appeal is filed, the High Court has full power to reappreciate, review and reconsider the evidence at large, the material on which the order of acquittal is founded and to reach its own conclusions on such evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: Both questions of fact and of law are open to determination by the High Court in an appeal against an order of acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 23\\. It cannot, however, be forgotten that in case of acquittal, there is a double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person should be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved to be guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured an acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is certainly not weakened but reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: 24\\. Though the above principles are well established, a different note was struck in several decisions by various High 18 Courts and even by this Court. It is, therefore, appropriate if we consider some of the leading decisions on the point.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 25\\. The first important decision was rendered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in [?CITATION?]. In Sheo Swarup the accused were acquitted by the trial court and the local Government directed the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from an order of acquittal under Section 417 of the old Code (similar to Section 378 of the present Code). At the time of hearing of appeal before the High Court, it was contended on behalf of the accused that in an appeal from an order of acquittal, it was not open to the appellate court to interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the trial Judge unless such findings could not have been reached by him had there not been some perversity or incompetence on his part. The High Court, however, declined to accept the said view. It held that no condition was imposed on the High Court in such appeal.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: It accordingly reviewed all the evidence in the case and having 19 formed an opinion of its weight and reliability different from that of the trial Judge, recorded an order of conviction. A petition was presented to His Majesty in Council for leave to appeal on the ground that conflicting views had been expressed by the High Courts in different parts of India upon the question whether in an appeal from an order of acquittal, an appellate court had the power to interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the trial Judge. Their Lordships thought it fit to clarify the legal position and accordingly upon the \"humble advice of their Lordships\", leave was granted by His Majesty. The case was, thereafter, argued. The Committee considered the scheme and interpreting Section 417 of the Code (old Code) observed that there was no indication in the Code of any limitation or restriction on the High Court in exercise of powers as an Appellate Tribunal. The Code also made no distinction as regards powers of the High Court in dealing with an appeal against acquittal and an appeal against conviction. Though several authorities were cited revealing different views by the High Courts dealing with an appeal from an order of acquittal, the Committee did not think it proper to 20 discuss all the cases.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: 26\\. Lord Russel summed up the legal position thus:\n",
      "Paragraph 74: \"There is, in their opinion, no foundation for the view, apparently supported by the judgments of some courts in India, that the High Court has no power or jurisdiction to reverse an order of acquittal on a matter of fact, except in cases in which the lower court has `obstinately blundered', or has `through incompetence, stupidity or perversity' reached such `distorted conclusions as to produce a positive miscarriage of justice', or has in some other way so conducted or misconducted itself as to produce a glaring miscarriage of justice, or has been tricked by the defence so as to produce a similar result.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 75: His Lordship, then proceeded to observe: (IA p.404) \"Sections 417, 418 and 423 of the Code give to the High Court full power to review at large the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded, and to reach the conclusion that upon that evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed. No limitation should be placed upon that power, unless it be found expressly stated in the Code.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 21\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 27\\. The Committee, however, cautioned appellate courts and stated: (IA p.404) \"But in exercising the power conferred by the Code and before reaching its conclusions upon fact, the High Court should and will always give proper weight and consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt;\n",
      "Paragraph 78: and (4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: To state this, however, is only to say that the High Court in its conduct of the appeal should and will act in accordance with rules and principles well known and recognised in the administration of justice.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 80: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 81: 28\\. In [?CITATION?], the Committee reiterated the above view in Sheo Swarup (Supra) and held that in an appeal against acquittal, the High Court has full powers to review and to reverse acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: 22\n",
      "Paragraph 83: 29\\. So far as this Court is concerned, probably the first decision on the point was [?CITATION?] (though the case was decided on 14-3-1950, it was reported only in 1954). In that case, the accused was acquitted by the trial court. The Provincial Government preferred an appeal which was allowed and the accused was convicted for offences punishable under Sections 302 and 323 IPC. The High Court, for convicting the accused, placed reliance on certain eyewitnesses.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: 30\\. Upholding the decision of the High Court and following the proposition of law in Sheo Swarup (supra), a six-Judge Bench held as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 85: \"6\\. It must be observed at the very outset that we cannot support the view which has been expressed in several cases that the High Court has no power under Section 417, Criminal Procedure Code, to reverse a judgment of acquittal, unless the judgment is perverse or the subordinate court has in some way or other misdirected itself so as to produce a miscarriage of justice.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 86: (emphasis supplied) 23\n",
      "Paragraph 87: 31\\. In [?CITATION?], a two-Judge Bench observed that it was well established that in an appeal under Section 417 of the (old) Code, the High Court had full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded. But it was equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused was further reinforced by his acquittal by the trial court, and the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence could be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: 32\\. In [?CITATION?] the accused was acquitted by the trial court but was convicted by the High Court in an appeal against acquittal filed by the State. The aggrieved accused approached this Court. It was contended by him that there were \"no compelling reasons\" for setting aside the order of acquittal and due and proper weight had not been given by the High Court to the opinion of the 24 trial court as regards the credibility of witnesses seen and examined. It was also commented that the High Court committed an error of law in observing that \"when a strong `prima facie' case is made out against an accused person it is his duty to explain the circumstances appearing in evidence against him and he cannot take shelter behind the presumption of innocence and cannot state that the law entitles him to keep his lips sealed\".\n",
      "Paragraph 89: Upholding the contention, this Court said:\n",
      "Paragraph 90: \"We think this criticism is well founded. After an order of acquittal has been made the presumption of innocence is further reinforced by that order, and that being so, the trial court's decision can be reversed not on the ground that the accused had failed to explain the circumstances appearing against him but only for very substantial and compelling reasons.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 91: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 92: 33\\. In [?CITATION?] this Court said:\n",
      "Paragraph 93: 25 \"In our opinion, it is not correct to say that unless the appellate court in an appeal under Section 417, Criminal Procedure Code came to the conclusion that the judgment of acquittal under appeal was perverse it could not set aside that order.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: It has been laid down by this Court that it is open to the High Court on an appeal against an order of acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion, of course, keeping in view the well-established rule that the presumption of innocence of the accused is not weakened but strengthened by the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court which had the advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses whose evidence have been recorded in its presence.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: It is also well settled that the court of appeal has as wide powers of appreciation of evidence in an appeal against an order of acquittal as in the case of an appeal against an order of conviction, subject to the riders that the presumption of innocence with which the accused person starts in the trial court continues even up to the appellate stage and that the appellate court should attach due weight to the opinion of the trial court which recorded the order of acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: If the appellate court reviews the evidence, keeping those principles in mind, and comes to a contrary conclusion, the judgment cannot be said to have been vitiated.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 97: (emphasis supplied) 26\n",
      "Paragraph 98: 34\\. In [?CITATION?] the accused was prosecuted under Sections 302 and 447 IPC. He was acquitted by the trial court but convicted by the High Court. Dealing with the power of the High Court against an order of acquittal, Bose, J. speaking for the majority (2:1) stated: (AIR p. 220, para 1) \"It is, in our opinion, well settled that it is not enough for the High Court to take a different view of the evidence; there must also be substantial and compelling reasons for holding that the trial court was wrong.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 99: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 100: 35\\. In [?CITATION?], a three-Judge Bench considered almost all leading decisions on the point and observed that there was no difficulty in applying the principles laid down by the Privy Council and accepted by the Supreme Court. The Court, however, noted that appellate courts found considerable difficulty in understanding the scope of the words \"substantial and compelling reasons\" used in certain decisions. It was observed inter-alia as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 101: 27 \"This Court obviously did not and could not add a condition to Section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The words were intended to convey the idea that an appellate court not only shall bear in mind the principles laid down by the Privy Council but also must give its clear reasons for coming to the conclusion that the order of acquittal was wrong.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 102: The Court concluded as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 103: \"9\\. The foregoing discussion yields the following results: (1) an appellate court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded; (2) the principles laid down in Sheo Swarup case afford a correct guide for the appellate court's approach to a case in disposing of such an appeal; and (3) the different phraseology used in the judgments of this Court, such as, (i) `substantial and compelling reasons', (ii) `good and sufficiently cogent reasons', and (iii) `strong reasons' are not intended to curtail the undoubted power of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion; but in doing so it should not only consider every matter on record having a bearing on the questions of fact and the reasons given by the court below in support of its order of acquittal in its arriving at a conclusion on those facts, but should also express those reasons in its judgment, which lead it to hold that the acquittal was not justified.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 104: 28\n",
      "Paragraph 105: 36\\. Again, in [?CITATION?], the point was raised before a Constitution Bench of this Court. Taking note of earlier decisions, it was observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 106: \"17\\. In some of the earlier decisions of this Court, however, in emphasising the importance of adopting a cautious approach in dealing with appeals against acquittals, it was observed that the presumption of innocence is reinforced by the order of acquittal and so, `the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons': vide [?CITATION?]. Similarly in [?CITATION?], it was observed that the interference of the High Court in an appeal against the order of acquittal would be justified only if there are `very substantial and compelling reasons to do so'. In some other decisions, it has been stated that an order of acquittal can be reversed only for `good and sufficiently cogent reasons' or for `strong reasons'. In appreciating the effect of these observations, it must be remembered that these observations were not intended to lay down a rigid or inflexible rule which should govern the decision of the High Court in appeals against acquittals. They were not intended, and should not be read to have intended to introduce an additional condition in clause (a) of Section 423(1) of the Code. All that the said observations are intended to emphasize is that the approach of the High Court in dealing with an appeal against acquittal ought to be 29 cautious because as Lord Russell observed in Sheo Swarup the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused `is not certainly weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial'. Therefore, the test suggested by the expression `substantial and compelling reasons' should not be construed as a formula which has to be rigidly applied in every case. That is the effect of the recent decisions of this Court, for instance, in Sanwat Singh v. State of Rajasthan and [?CITATION?] and so, it is not necessary that before reversing a judgment of acquittal, the High Court must necessarily characterise the findings recorded therein as perverse.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 107: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 108: 37\\. Yet in another leading decision in [?CITATION?] this Court held that in India, there is no jurisdictional limitation on the powers of appellate court. \"In law there are no fetters on the plenary power of the appellate court to review the whole evidence on which the order of acquittal is founded and, indeed, it has a duty to scrutinise the probative material de novo, informed, however, by the weighty thought that the rebuttable innocence attributed to the accused having been converted into an acquittal the homage our jurisprudence 30 owes to individual liberty constrains the higher court not to upset the holding without very convincing reasons and comprehensive consideration.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 109: 38\\. Putting emphasis on balance between importance of individual liberty and evil of acquitting guilty persons, this Court observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 110: \"6\\. Even at this stage we may remind ourselves of a necessary social perspective in criminal cases which suffers from insufficient forensic appreciation. The dangers of exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt at the expense of social defence and to the soothing sentiment that all acquittals are always good regardless of justice to the victim and the community, demand especial emphasis in the contemporary context of escalating crime and escape. The judicial instrument has a public accountability. The cherished principles or golden thread of proof beyond reasonable doubt which runs thro' the web of our law should not be stretched morbidly to embrace every hunch, hesitancy and degree of doubt. The excessive solicitude reflected in the attitude that a thousand guilty men may go but one innocent martyr shall not suffer is a false dilemma. Only reasonable doubts belong to the accused.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: Otherwise any practical system of justice will then breakdown and lose credibility with the community. The evil of acquitting a guilty person 31 light-heartedly, as a learned author (Glanville Williams in Proof of Guilt) has saliently observed, goes much beyond the simple fact that just one guilty person has gone unpunished. If unmerited acquittals become general, they tend to lead to a cynical disregard of the law, and this in turn leads to a public demand for harsher legal presumptions against indicted `persons' and more severe punishment of those who are found guilty. Thus, too frequent acquittals of the guilty may lead to a ferocious penal law, eventually eroding the judicial protection of the guiltless.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: For all these reasons it is true to say, with Viscount Simon, that `a miscarriage of justice may arise from the acquittal of the guilty no less than from the conviction of the innocent....' In short, our jurisprudential enthusiasm for presumed innocence must be moderated by the pragmatic need to make criminal justice potent and realistic. A balance has to be struck between chasing chance possibilities as good enough to set the delinquent free and chopping the logic of preponderant probability to punish marginal innocents.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 113: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 114: 39\\. In [?CITATION?], the Court was considering the power of the High Court against an order of acquittal under Section 378 of the present Code. After considering the relevant decisions on the point it was stated as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 115: 32 \"9\\. The principles are now well settled. At one time it was thought that an order of acquittal could be set aside for `substantial and compelling reasons' only and courts used to launch on a search to discover those `substantial and compelling reasons'. However, the `formulae' of `substantial and compelling reasons', `good and sufficiently cogent reasons' and `strong reasons' and the search for them were abandoned as a result of the pronouncement of this Court in [?CITATION?]. In Sanwat Singh case this Court harked back to the principles enunciated by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup v. R. Emperor and reaffirmed those principles. After Sanwat Singh v.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: State of Rajasthan this Court has consistently recognised the right of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion bearing in mind the considerations mentioned by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup case. Occasionally phrases like `manifestly illegal', `grossly unjust', have been used to describe the orders of acquittal which warrant interference. But, such expressions have been used more as flourishes of language, to emphasise the reluctance of the appellate court to interfere with an order of acquittal than to curtail the power of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion. In some cases ([?CITATION?][?CITATION?]), it has been said that to the principles laid down in Sanwat Singh case may be added the further principle that `if two reasonable conclusions can be reached on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should 33 not disturb the finding of the trial court'. This, of course, is not a new principle. It stems out of the fundamental principle of our criminal jurisprudence that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt. If two reasonably probable and evenly balanced views of the evidence are possible, one must necessarily concede the existence of a reasonable doubt. But, fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account. To entitle an accused person to the benefit of a doubt arising from the possibility of a duality of views, the possible view in favour of the accused must be as nearly reasonably probable as that against him. If the preponderance of probability is all one way, a bare possibility of another view will not entitle the accused to claim the benefit of any doubt. It is, therefore, essential that any view of the evidence in favour of the accused must be reasonable even as any doubt, the benefit of which an accused person may claim, must be reasonable.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 117: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 118: 40\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court said:\n",
      "Paragraph 119: \"While sitting in judgment over an acquittal the appellate court is first required to seek an answer to the question whether the findings of the trial court are palpably wrong, manifestly erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable. If the appellate court answers the above question in the negative the order of acquittal is not to be 34 disturbed. Conversely, if the appellate court holds, for reasons to be recorded, that the order of acquittal cannot at all be sustained in view of any of the above infirmities it can then-and then only- reappraise the evidence to arrive at its own conclusions.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 120: 41\\. In [?CITATION?], referring to earlier decisions, the Court stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 121: \"7\\. The paramount consideration of the court should be to avoid miscarriage of justice. A miscarriage of justice which may arise from the acquittal of guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case where the trial court has taken a view based upon conjectures and hypothesis and not on the legal evidence, a duty is cast upon the High Court to reappreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes of ascertaining as to whether the accused has committed any offence or not.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: Probable view taken by the trial court which may not be disturbed in the appeal is such a view which is based upon legal and admissible evidence. Only because the accused has been acquitted by the trial court, cannot be made a basis to urge that the High Court under all circumstances should not disturb such a finding.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 123: 35\n",
      "Paragraph 124: 42\\. In [?CITATION?], the trial court acquitted the accused but the High Court convicted them. Negativing the contention of the appellants that the High Court could not have disturbed the findings of fact of the trial court even if that view was not correct, this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 125: \"7\\. We do not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellants that under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the High Court could not disturb the finding of facts of the trial court even if it found that the view taken by the trial court was not proper. On the basis of the pronouncements of this Court, the settled position of law regarding the powers of the High Court in an appeal against an order of acquittal is that the Court has full powers to review the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based and generally it will not interfere with the order of acquittal because by passing an order of acquittal the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is reinforced.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: The golden thread which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. Such is not a jurisdiction limitation on the appellate court but judge-made guidelines for circumspection. The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is avoided. A miscarriage of justice which may 36 arise from the acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case where the trial court has taken a view ignoring the admissible evidence, a duty is cast upon the High Court to reappreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes of ascertaining as to whether all or any of the accused has committed any offence or not\".\n",
      "Paragraph 127: 43\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court said:\n",
      "Paragraph 128: \"12\\. Doubtless the High Court in appeal either against an order of acquittal or conviction as a court of first appeal has full power to review the evidence to reach its own independent conclusion. However, it will not interfere with an order of acquittal lightly or merely because one other view is possible, because with the passing of an order of acquittal presumption of innocence in favour of the accused gets reinforced and strengthened. The High Court would not be justified to interfere with order of acquittal merely because it feels that sitting as a trial court it would have proceeded to record a conviction; a duty is cast on the High Court while reversing an order of acquittal to examine and discuss the reasons given by the trial court to acquit the accused and then to dispel those reasons. If the High Court fails to make such an exercise the judgment will suffer from serious infirmity.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 129: 37\n",
      "Paragraph 130: 44\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 131: \"21\\. There is no embargo on the appellate court reviewing the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based. Generally, the order of acquittal shall not be interfered with because the presumption of innocence of the accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast upon the appellate court to reappreciate the evidence in a case where the accused has been acquitted, for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether any of the accused committed any offence or not\".\n",
      "Paragraph 132: 45\\. Again in [?CITATION?], this Court stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 133: \"8\\. While deciding an appeal against acquittal, the power of the appellate court is no less than 38 the power exercised while hearing appeals against conviction. In both types of appeals, the power exists to review the entire evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 134: However, one significant difference is that an order of acquittal will not be interfered with, by an appellate court, where the judgment of the trial court is based on evidence and the view taken is reasonable and plausible. It will not reverse the decision of the trial court merely because a different view is possible. The appellate court will also bear in mind that there is a presumption of innocence in favour of the accused and the accused is entitled to get the benefit of any doubt. Further if it decides to interfere, it should assign reasons for differing with the decision of the trial court.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 135: (emphasis supplied) 46\\. From the above decisions, in [?CITATION?], the following general principles regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal were culled out:\n",
      "Paragraph 136: (1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.\n",
      "Paragraph 137: 39 (2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law.\n",
      "Paragraph 138: (3) Various expressions, such as, \"substantial and compelling reasons\", \"good and sufficient grounds\", \"very strong circumstances\", \"distorted conclusions\", \"glaring mistakes\", etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature of \"flourishes of language\" to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: (4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed 40 to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court.\n",
      "Paragraph 140: (5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.\n",
      "Paragraph 141: 47\\. A person has, no doubt, a profound right not to be convicted of an offence which is not established by the evidential standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Though this standard is a higher standard, there is, however, no absolute standard. What degree of probability amounts to \"proof\" is an exercise particular to each case. Referring to the interdependence of evidence and the confirmation of one piece of evidence by another, a learned author says [see \"The Mathematics of Proof II\": Glanville Williams, Criminal Law Review, 1979, by Sweet and Maxwell, p.340 (342)]:\n",
      "Paragraph 142: 41 \"The simple multiplication rule does not apply if the separate pieces of evidence are dependent.\n",
      "Paragraph 143: Two events are dependent when they tend to occur together, and the evidence of such events may also be said to be dependent. In a criminal case, different pieces of evidence directed to establishing that the defendant did the prohibited act with the specified state of mind are generally dependent. A junior may feel doubt whether to credit an alleged confession, and doubt whether to infer guilt from the fact that the defendant fled from justice. But since it is generally guilty rather than innocent people who make confessions, and guilty rather than innocent people who run away, the two doubts are not to be multiplied together. The one piece of evidence may confirm the other.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 144: 48\\. Doubts would be called reasonable if they are free from a zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot afford any favourite other than truth. To constitute reasonable doubt, it must be free from an overemotional response. Doubts must be actual and substantial doubts as to the guilt of the accused persons arising from the evidence, or from the lack of it, as opposed to mere vague apprehensions. A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or a merely possible doubt, but a fair doubt 42 based upon reason and common sense. It must grow out of the evidence in the case.\n",
      "Paragraph 145: 49\\. The concepts of probability, and the degrees of it, cannot obviously be expressed in terms of units to be mathematically enumerated as to how many of such units constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt. There is an unmistakable subjective element in the evaluation of the degrees of probability and the quantum of proof. Forensic probability must, in the last analysis, rest on a robust common sense and, ultimately, on the trained intuitions of the Judge. While the protection given by the criminal process to the accused persons is not to be eroded, at the same time, uninformed legitimization of trivialities would make a mockery of administration of criminal justice. This position was illuminatingly stated by Venkatachaliah, J. (as His Lordship then was) in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 146: 43 50\\. The above position was highlighted in [?CITATION?] and in [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 147: 51\\. When the factual position is analysed in the background of the conclusions arrived at by the High Court, the inevitable conclusion is that the High Court's judgment is correct. The appeal is dismissed. The appellants who are directed to be released on bail by order dated 10.12.2001, shall surrender to custody forthwith to serve the remainder of sentence.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: This group of appeals has been filed by various appellant-Associations questioning the correctness of the common impugned judgment and order dated 21.03.2007 passed in Letters Patent Appeal No. 690 of 2004 along with batch matters by the Delhi High Court in dismissing the appeals of the appellant/concerned workmen by issuing certain directions contained at para 20(a) of the said impugned judgment in affirming the judgment and order of learned single Judge in allowing the Writ Petitions filed by the respondent- Life Insurance Corporation of India (for short \"the Corporation\"). The appellant-Associations have filed these appeals urging various relevant facts and legal contentions with a prayer to restore the Award dated 18.06.2001 passed by the Central Government Industrial Tribunal, New Delhi (for short \"the CGIT\") in I.D. No.27 of 1991\\. The facts of the case are stated here under for the purpose of appreciating the factual and rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties with a view to ascertain whether the appellants/concerned workmen are entitled to the relief as prayed for in these appeals:- The concerned workmen are the members of the appellant-Associations, Federation of Employees Association, Workers Association and other concerned individual workmen who were working in the branches of the Corporation at various places in the country have raised the existing industrial dispute between the concerned workmen and the management of the Corporation regarding their absorption as regular and permanent service employees in their respective posts of the Corporation. The concerned workmen in all these appeals have been working as temporary, badli and part- time workmen claiming that they have been appointed by the management of the Corporation on daily wage basis against the leave vacancies and other vacancies of its employees in Class III and IV posts in various branch offices and Divisions of the Corporation. Their claim for regularisation were based on two Awards passed of the National Industrial Tribunal (for short 'the NIT') (i) the Award passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule on 17.04.1986 with regard to absorption of similarly placed workmen by the Corporation who had been working on temporary/badli/part-time basis in Class III and IV category posts in their respective branches of the Corporation and (ii)the Award passed by Justice S.M. Jamdar dated 26.08.1988, in pursuant to the reference made by the Ministry of Labour, Government of India, under Section 36A of the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] , where the NIT clarified and affirmed the Award dated 17.04.1986 passed by Justice R. D. Tulpule. The present dispute that arose between the concerned workmen and the Corporation was referred to the CGIT by the Ministry of Labour, Central Government, in exercise of its statutory power under Section 10(1)(d) read with Section 2A of the Act vide Order No. L-17011/107/90-IR-B(II) dated 04.03.1991 on the basis of the report of the Conciliation Officer for its adjudication on the following question :- \"Whether the action of the management of Life Insurance Corporation of India in not absorbing Badli/temporary and part time workmen employed in the establishment of LIC after 20.5.1985 is justified, if not, to what relief the workmen are entitled?\" The said industrial dispute has been raised by the Associations, Federation of workmen and concerned workmen in their individual capacity which was supported by the Unions and Associations of these workmen of the divisions and zones of the Corporation across India and workmen who have represented their case on individual basis. Apart from the said Unions, Associations, Federation of some of the workmen from Tamilnadu Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees Association and E. Prabhawati and Ors. had also been impleaded as parties in the dispute before the CGIT. E. Prabhawati and Ors. were impleaded vide order dated 01.12.1993 and The Tamil Nadu Terminated Temporary Full Time LIC Association was impleaded in the pending reference case vide order dated 06.04.1995. The Corporation is a creature of the Statute, namely, Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 (for short \"the LIC Act\"). Section 48 of the LIC Act enables the Central Government to make rules to carry out the performance of the Act by notification in the official gazette. Section 49(1) of the LIC Act empowers the Corporation to make regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of the LIC Act and the rules made there under provide for all matters for which provision is expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the LIC Act with the previous approval of the Central Government by notification in the gazette of India. Section 49(2) of the LIC Act lists certain matters for which Regulations may be made without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by sub-section (1). The LIC Act was amended by the Amendment Act 17 of 1957 with retrospective effect by incorporating sub-clause (bb) of sub-section 2 of Section 49 of the Amended Act, 1957 which was omitted later by Act 1 of 1981 (w.e.f. 31.1.1981) which provides for terms and conditions of service of the persons who have become employees of the Corporation under its Section 11 sub-Section (1) of the Act. By the authority vested in the Corporation under clause (bb) of sub-Section (2) of Section 49 of the amended Act, the Corporation framed Regulations defining the terms and conditions of service of the staff of the Corporation known as LIC of India (Staff) Regulations, 1960 (for short \"the Staff Regulations, 1960\") which was notified in the Gazette of India No. IV dated 23.7.1960 and came into force with effect from 1.7.1960. It is pertinent to note that although according to the Staff Regulations, 1960 there are only two types of employment that have been provided for in the Regulations (i) regular and (ii) temporary. The employment in the capacity of badlis, part-time is not provided thereunder. There is no specific nomenclature in the Staff Regulations, 1960, in this regard, but the said type of employment is prevalent in the Corporation both in the Center and also in various Divisions, Zonal offices throughout India. The concerned workmen have been continuously working in different capacities such as peons, hamals, watchman-cum-pump man, lift man, house attendants, sweepers, cleaners, assistant typist etc. on daily wage basis against permanent and other vacancies during that period. Between the years 1981-85, a large number of employees of Class III and IV posts were employed by the Corporation in the capacity of badlis, temporary and part-time workers. Their wage, conditions for the absorption into the regular cadre and other conditions of service were the subject matter of the Industrial Dispute. Thus, the reference was made in this regard to the National Industrial Tribunal as reference No. NTB-I of 1985. At the initial stage, the Western Zone Insurance Employees Association, Bombay and the Central Zone National Life Insurance Corporation Employees Association, Kanpur were the only parties to the reference besides the Corporation. Later on, all the Unions of all the Regions and the Zones in the country joined as parties and filed their respective claim statements before the NIT. During the course of said proceedings an interim Award was passed by the National Industrial Tribunal on the prayer of the workmen, restricting the Corporation from recruiting or absorbing any person in the posts without prior permission of the Tribunal. According to the interim Award passed by the NIT, the Corporation was restrained from making any new appointments except where persons had to be appointed over and above the then existing vacancies against which posts the badli, temporary or part- time workmen who had been working or had worked with the Corporation and those who would be concerned in the reference had to be appointed from amongst the badlis, temporary or part-time workmen against any vacancy continued, provided an undertaking is given to the Corporation by such workmen stating that no benefit would be claimed. After adjudication of the said Industrial Dispute between the parties, the Award was passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule on 17.4.1986. The said Award was based on the suggestions invited both from the workmen and from the management of the Corporation. The parties had given the mandate to the NIT to base its Award on any of the suggestions given by the parties after making necessary modifications. In the Award dated 17.04.1986, it was held that only those workmen who had worked in the Corporation during the period January 1, 1982 to May 20, 1985, the date of the reference was to be considered as eligible for absorption. The Award held that the workmen claiming absorption in Class III posts should have worked for 85 days in a period of two calendar years and the workman claiming absorption in Class IV post should have worked for 70 days in a period of three calendar years. It was further held by the NIT that the calculation of the number of days of work should be up to the date of reference. The Corporation was further directed to appoint a screening committee to consider suitability and desirability of such eligible workmen for their absorption in the posts of the Corporation. It was also directed by the NIT to the Corporation that the workmen considered to be suitable and desirable for the absorption should be absorbed against vacancies which existed in the Corporation as on 31.3.1985 and those which may arise subsequently. The Corporation was also directed not to recruit outsiders in a particular Division till such lists of workmen were exhausted. Directions given in the Award on the question of absorptions have been mentioned in paras 40 to 60 and 66 of the Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule. Aggrieved by the said Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule dated 17.4.1986, the Corporation filed Writ Petition No. 1801 of 1986 before the High Court of Judicature of Bombay challenging its legality. The Writ Petition of the Corporation was dismissed by the High Court vide order dated 14.8.1986, but at the same time, the High Court gave a certificate to the Corporation for seeking clarification of the said Award under Section 36A of the Act. In compliance with the Award dated 17.04.1986, the Corporation, while interpreting the Award with respect to the absorption of the workmen as recruitment, had issued six circulars commencing from 17.9.1986 to 25.2.1987. The Workers Union and Associations disputed the aforesaid instructions issued by the Corporation. Therefore, an Industrial Dispute was raised once again. The Central Government in the Ministry of Labour made a reference under Section 36A of the Act to the NIT being presided over by Justice S.M. Jamdar and the same was registered as NTB(1) of 1987, which reads thus :- \"Can the Award dated 17.4.1986 with special reference to paragraphs 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, 64 and 66 and the interim order dated 14.3.1986 be interpreted to mean that the Central Office of the Life Insurance Corporation of India is empowered to issue instructions/guidelines as contained in their circular issued in this behalf to implement the directions of the Award. If not, what could be the correct interpretation of various directions covered by the said paragraphs in the circumstances of the case. Whether the term \"absorption\" referred to at various places in the Award can be interpreted in mean \"recruitment\". During the course of the hearing of the said reference, an interim order was passed by the NIT restraining the Corporation to make any recruitment from the open market during the pendency of the proceedings. The NIT, after hearing the parties and examining the points of dispute, answered the term of reference and gave its own interpretation of the earlier Award passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule holding that the observations contemplated by the earlier Award did not mean recruitment. An Award dated 26.8.1988 was passed accordingly by Justice S.M. Jamdar clarifying the Award passed by Justice Tulpule that absorption of workmen does not mean recruitment. Aggrieved by the said Award, the Corporation preferred SLP No. 14906 of 1988 titled The Management of Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Their Workmen before this Court urging various legal contentions. It is the case of the Corporation that during the course of the said SLP, a compromise was entered into between the Corporation and 8 out of the 9 Unions of the above SLP. Accordingly, this Court passed an order dated 1.3.1989 on the basis of the said compromise. The terms and conditions of the said compromise between the parties therein will be extracted in the reasoning portion of this Judgment. In pursuant to the said compromise between the parties in the SLP, as directed by this Court, the Corporation gave appointments to a large number of such workmen working on temporary, badli and part-time basis to the posts in the Class III as well as Class IV in various Divisions of the Corporation. The said appointments were given to the persons recruited on temporary basis between 1.1.1982 to 20.5.1985. Thereafter, the employees who were employed as temporary, badli and part-time workers after 20.5.1985 raised the demand for their absorption and regularisation of their service as permanent employees. When their demands were not accepted by the Corporation, several writ petitions in this respect were filed before the High Court of Madras between the years 1989 to 1991. The writ petition No. 10367 of 1989 filed between the Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Welfare Association and Senior Divisional Manager, LIC, Khanjawar, along with 18 other writ petitions were listed for hearing before the full bench of the High Court of Madras. After hearing the parties of all the writ petitions, the High Court dismissed the same which decision is reported in 1993 (1) LLJ 1030. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, SLP (C) Nos. 10393-10413 of 1992 titled E. Prabhawati and Ors. v. LIC of India & Ors. were filed before this Court. In the said SLPs, on the direction of this Court, the Corporation framed a Scheme for the regularization of the employees in their service who were granted ad- hoc appointments for 85 days at intervals from time to time and placed the same before this Court. After hearing the parties, this Court by means of an interim order dated 23.1.1992 found the Scheme to be reasonable and approved clauses (a) to (d) of paragraph 1 of the said Scheme and the Corporation was directed to proceed to regularize the employees eligible in their service in accordance with the said Scheme. It is also pertinent to note that during the pendency of the writ petitions before the High Court of Madras, the industrial dispute that arose between the concerned workmen and the Corporation in these appeals were referred to the CGIT by the Ministry of Labour vide order dated 4.3.1991. Further, during the continuance of the proceedings of the present reference E. Prabhawati and Ors. their impleadment application was allowed vide order dated 1.12.1993. However, they did not implead in the above dispute proceedings. Thereafter, G. Sudhakar and Ors. (similarly placed employees) approached the High Court of Andhra Pradesh seeking relief for the absorption in their employment of the Corporation in the Divisions where they were working. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh after hearing the parties gave directions to the Corporation to frame a Scheme on par with the E. Prabhavathy Scheme for regularisation of such workmen. Aggrieved by the said order, the Corporation filed C.A. No. 2104 of 2000 titled [?CITATION?] before this Court which was disposed of by observing that the Scheme as has been passed in the case of E. Prabhavati & Ors. case (supra) will also be applicable to the case of G. Sudhakar and Ors. The CGIT conducted an inquiry to answer the points of disputes arising from the industrial dispute raised by the concerned workmen in this case. The CGIT on the basis of the pleadings, evidence on record and also on the basis of the Award passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule which was clarified in the Award passed by Justice S.M. Jamdar referred to supra, held that the same are applicable to the concerned workmen in this dispute. Accordingly, the CGIT passed an Award dated 18.06.2001 in terms of Justice R.D. Tulpule and Justice S.M. Jamdar, giving directions to the Corporation for their absorption in their respective posts. The Corporation being aggrieved by the Award passed by the CGIT filed Civil Writ Petition No. 4346 of 2001 before the Delhi High Court placing strong reliance upon the order passed by this Court wherein it accepted the terms and conditions of the compromise arrived at between the parties in the The Management of Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Their Workmen (SLP No 14906 of 1988) referred to supra which was filed by the Corporation against the Awards of the NIT by Justice R.D. Tulpule and Justice S.M. Jamdar Awards. Further, reliance was placed on E. Prabhavati & Ors. case (supra) which was disposed of as per the Scheme worked out by the Corporation pursuant to the orders of this Court in that case. The said Scheme was as per the decision in the case of State of Haryana & Ors. v. Piara Singh & Ors. wherein, this Court indicated how regularisation of ad- hoc/temporary employees in the Government and Public Sector Undertakings should be effected. Thereafter, the case of G. Sudhakar & others (supra) was also disposed of as per terms in the E. Prabhavathi Scheme. Further, it was contended by the Corporation before the learned single Judge of the High Court that the CGIT without accepting the said order/Scheme which is binding upon it under Article 141 of the Constitution of India has erroneously answered the points of dispute in favour of the concerned workmen. The said contention of the Corporation was opposed by the Association, Unions, the Federation and concerned workmen involved in these appeals. The learned single Judge accepted the contention raised by the Corporation by relying on decisions rendered by this Court in the case of E. Prabhavathy & Ors. (supra) and G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra) and thereafter, held that on plain reading of the above said decisions of this Court, the term of reference before the CGIT stood answered when this Court decided E. Prabhavathy & Ors. (supra), which again was concluded and reiterated in the decision of this Court in G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra). Consequently, the Award passed by the CGIT in relation to the concerned workmen of these appeals was set aside by the learned single Judge by assigning his reasons in judgment and order passed by him. Aggrieved by the Judgment and order passed by the learned single Judge of the High Court, the concerned workmen challenged the same by filing L.P.A. No. 690 of 2004 and other connected appeals before the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court inter alia urging that the findings and reasons recorded by the learned single Judge in his judgment are not only erroneous in law but also suffer from error in law as the learned single Judge has accepted the binding settlement between the Corporation and the similarly placed workmen. It was further contended that Section 18 (3) and Section 19 (3) & (6) of the Act were not properly examined keeping in mind that the said settlement arose out of the Awards of the NIT being challenged before this Court in SLP No. 14906 of 1988, however this Court at no point set aside the NIT Awards in spite of the compromise arrived at between the parties therein, therefore, the learned single Judge failed to consider that the said Awards were still binding upon the Corporation. Therefore, it was contended by the concerned workmen before the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi that the learned single Judge was not right in setting aside the Award passed by the CGIT in favour of the concerned workmen involved in these appeals and prayed for setting aside the same by allowing the Letters Patent Appeals. The Division Bench of High Court of Delhi examined the points of dispute arising out of the Industrial Disputes raised by the workmen of the Corporation, facts and rival legal contentions and the correctness of the finding recorded by the learned single Judge in setting aside the Award of the CGIT. It was held by the Division Bench that the appointment letters issued to the various employees specifically stipulated that their appointments are temporary for a specified period and the same would be terminated on the expiry or the period specified therein and that during the period of the temporary appointment none of the provisions of the LIC (Staff) Regulations, 1960 would apply. It was further held that the appellants had accepted the aforesaid terms of appointment and therefore, they cannot raise a claim for their regularisation or automatic absorption in the permanent posts. It was further held that this Court in the decisions of E. Prabhavathy & Ors. and G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra) also declined regularisation of workmen and directed the Corporation for conducting selection process for regular appointment and that none of the appellants as on the date of raising of the industrial dispute were continuing in their respective posts as their services stood terminated on the expiry of the tenure of their temporary employment and even if they had continued to serve it was because of orders passed by various courts. It was further held by the Division Bench that the reliance placed on paragraph 53 of the Secretary, [?CITATION?] by the appellants was misplaced as the ratio laid down in the said case is not applicable to the facts of the present case under any circumstance. It was further held that in the present cases, there is a specific rule which provides as to how recruitment has to be made to the vacant posts on regular basis, and the workmen herein were recruited under different set of instructions altogether which were meant for engagement of workmen on temporary basis and permit recruitment of temporary staff who would not be entitled for absorption in the posts of Class III and IV of the Corporation. Therefore, the Division Bench held that none of the cases of the appellants would attract for issuance of the direction to the Corporation to absorb them automatically in their posts and dismissed the Letter Patent Appeals filed by the concerned workmen. Hence, the present appeals urging various legal grounds. The correctness of the said findings of the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench are challenged by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the concerned workmen in these appeals inter alia, contending that the Award of the CGIT passed after adjudication of points of dispute was in relation to the concerned workmen who have been appointed by the Corporation as temporary, badli and part-time workmen after 20.5.1985. These workmen have been appointed by following the procedure under the LIC (Staff) Regulations issued by the Corporation from time to time and they have been discharging permanent nature of work against permanent and regular vacancies as temporary, badli and part-time workmen in the various offices, Zones and Divisions of the Corporation across India. Further, it is contended that the Awards passed by the NIT by Justice R.D. Tulpule, the same being clarified and affirmed by Justice S.M. Jamdar vide reference under Section 36A of the Act, were passed after determination of the points of dispute in relation to the industrial dispute raised by similarly placed workmen of the Corporation who were appointed and had been working on such permanent and regular posts on temporary, badli and part-time basis in Class III and IV categories of employees of the Corporation between 01.01.1982 to 20.05.1985. Therefore, the NIT Awards clarified that those similarly placed workmen were entitled for absorption in terms of the direction given in the Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule which was clarified subsequently by the Award passed in 1988 by Justice S. M. Jamdar. Of course, the said Awards by the NIT were challenged before this Court in the SLP No. 14906 of 1988 at the end of which eight out of nine unions therein entered into a compromise with the Corporation and the same was permitted by this Court by way of an interim measure without any prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of the other Union who had not entered into such compromise. Accordingly, the said SLP was disposed of by this Court vide order dated 01.3.1989. Further, it is contended by the learned counsel that the CGIT has rightly placed reliance upon the terms and conditions of the Awards of Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar. Though the said Awards were challenged before this Court and the matter was disposed of in terms of the compromise arrived at between the parties therein, the NIT Awards were not set aside or terminated by the Corporation or by any other Award or order passed by NIT or any other Court. Hence, the same will be operative and binding between the parties under Section 18(3)(d) read with Section 19 sub-section(3) & (6) of the Act. In support of their contention, reliance was placed upon the decision of [?CITATION?] It is also contended by Mr. Shekhar Naphade, learned amicus curiae on behalf of the workmen that the industrial dispute was raised under the provision of Section 2(k) read with Section 10 and 12 of the Act by the concerned workmen who have been working as temporary, badli and part-time workmen in the posts of Class III and Class IV of the Corporation for their absorption in the permanent posts. The said claim of the concerned workmen was disputed by the Corporation; the Central Government referred the existing industrial dispute to the CGIT for adjudication of the points of dispute as it has got the jurisdiction to adjudicate the said industrial dispute. He placed strong reliance upon Schedule IV of the Act and invited our attention to Item No. 6 in Schedule II under which matters other than those specified in the III Schedule are within the jurisdiction of the Labour Court and also Item No. 11 of Schedule IV which provides for Conditions of Service for Change of which Notice is to be given by the Corporation in case of any increase or reduction (other than casual) in the number of persons employed or to be employed in any occupation or process or department or shift, [not occasioned by the circumstances over which the employer has no control]. Since the Corporation is a Statutory Body which has come into existence under the LIC Act, 1956, it is required to follow the provisions of the Act with regard to service conditions of the workmen, including better service conditions, absorption, regularisation etc. He has also placed reliance upon the Item No. 10 of V Schedule to the Act, wherein it states that it is an unfair labour practice on the part of the employer to employ workmen as \"badlis\", casuals or temporaries and continue them as such for years, with the object of depriving them of the status and privileges of permanent workmen and the same is prohibited under Section 25T of the Act. Further, strong reliance was placed by him upon the provisions under Section 25T and 25U under Chapter VC of the Act, with regard to the Unfair Labour Practices on the part of the employer wherein it is stated that an employee or a workman and Trade Union shall not commit any unfair labour practice in relation to the matter as enumerated in the V Schedule referred to supra and further Section 25U of the Act contemplates that any person either employer or Trade Unions of Employers who commits unfair labour practice as enumerated in the V schedule shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to Rs.1,000/- or both. Therefore, it is contended that in the case on hand, the workmen concerned have been employed on temporary, badli and part- time basis for several years, depriving them of the privileges of permanent workmen which is a clear case of unfair labour practice on the part of the Corporation under Item 10 Schedule V, which is prohibited under Section 25T of the Act and the Corporation would be liable for penalty under Section 25U of the Act. Therefore, the CGIT has got ample power to adjudicate the existing industrial dispute between the parties on the basis of the points of dispute referred to it with respect to the claim raised by the concerned workmen. Further, in justification of the Awards passed by the NIT in giving direction to the Corporation to absorb similarly situated workmen from 01.01.1982 till 20.05.1985, strong reliance was placed by him upon the case of [?CITATION?] wherein, this Court discussed the powers of Industrial Tribunal to override the contracts. Therefore, the aforesaid Awards passed by the NIT are binding between the parties under Section 18(3) of the Act. The Awards passed by the NIT in a similar dispute are still operative as the same are not terminated by either of the parties as provided under Section 19(6) of the Act, even after the expiry of the period of operation under Section 19(3) of the Act, & therefore, the Awards shall continue to be operative & binding on the parties until a period of two months has elapsed from the date on which notice is given by the Corporation intimating its intention to terminate the Awards. He further contended that in the case on hand, no such notice is issued by either of the parties and therefore the Awards are operative and binding in law upon the parties. The aforesaid contentions, are rebutted by the learned senior counsel Mr. Kailash Vasdev, appearing on behalf of the Corporation, placing strong reliance on a series of judgments of this Court to show that the compromise was entered into between the Corporation and 99% of the employees on behalf of the workmen involved in the SLP 14906 of 1988 filed by the Corporation questioning the correctness of the Awards passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule and Justice S.M. Jamdar. Therefore, the said compromise is binding between the parties as provided under Section 18(3) of the Act. Further, he has urged that the case of D. J. Bahadur (supra), upon which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the appellants, is sought to be distinguished by him by relying on paragraphs 43 and 47 of the said judgment in support of the case of the Corporation contending that the said decision does not render any assistance to the workmen in these appeals. He placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in the case of [?CITATION?],[?CITATION?],[?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] to contend that the said Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule and clarified by Justice S.M. Jamdar Award are replaced and merged with the compromise arrived at between the parties before this Court in SLP 14906 of 1988, and the said compromise is binding on the Corporation and the parties to the compromise that Awards are not in operation, therefore, the CGIT has erred in placing reliance upon the same to grant relief in favour of the workmen which has been rightly set aside by the High Court. It is further contended by him that in the SLP filed against the judgment of full Bench of the High Court of Madras by E. Prabhavati and Ors., wherein, the Scheme was framed by the Corporation in these cases on the direction of this Court, which was accepted by the parties and the Special Leave Petition was disposed of in the aforesaid terms by this Court by its order dated 23.10.1992. Further, it is contended that thereafter, the decision of the High Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh in the Writ Petition filed by G. Sudhakar and Ors. (supra) was also challenged by the Corporation before this Court and disposed of in the same in terms of the Scheme as in E. Prabhavathy & Ors.(supra) case. Further, it is submitted that the Award of absorption of the concerned workmen passed by the CGIT has been rightly set aside by the learned single Judge and the said decision of the learned single Judge has been rightly affirmed in the judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court by giving cogent and valid reasons and therefore, the same does not call for interference by this Court in exercise of its Appellate Jurisdiction. In view of the factual and rival legal contentions urged by the learned counsel on behalf of the parties and the amicus curiae, we have to answer the same by recording our reasons as to (i) whether the setting aside of the Award passed by the CGIT by the learned single Judge by placing reliance upon compromise reached between the parties in SLP No.14906 of 1988, which was filed against the Award of Justice Tulpule, which Award was clarified and affirmed by Justice S.M. Jamdar is justified, legal and valid?, (ii) whether the judgment and order of the learned single Judge being affirmed by the Division Bench of High Court in its judgment is legal and valid? and (iii) what Award/Order the appellants are entitled to in law? We answer point (i) and (ii) together as the same are interrelated by assigning the following reasons- Undisputedly, the concerned workmen in the above references before the CGIT have been working in different offices and Zones, Divisional offices of the Corporation in various posts namely peons, hamals, watchman-cum-pump man, lift man, house attendants, sweepers, cleaners, assistant typist etc in different parts of the country who were appointed by following the Rules and Instructions of the Corporation which were relevant at that point of time. The concerned workmen in industrial dispute referred to the CGIT have been discharging perennial nature of work against the regular permanent posts in the Corporation. The industrial dispute raised by similarly placed workmen, who were appointed between the period 01.01.1982 till 20.05.1985 was adjudicated on the points of dispute by the NIT with regard to the justification of absorption of the said workmen as permanent workmen in their respective posts by Justice R.D. Tulpule. The relevant portion of the Award is extracted as under for better appreciation of rival legal submissions made by the learned counsel on behalf of the parties with a view to examine the correctness of the findings recorded by the High Court:- \"65\\. In the light of the directions above with regard to observation and creation of additional post by the Corporation I do not think that there would be any occasion in future for the corporation to employ workman in the temporary and badlee categories existing for the occasional and temporary increase in work which necessitate employment of temporary staff in all probability would be only amongst class III cadre, in which case there could be no occasion and there need not be I think any case or situation require consideration or grant of any other benefit apart from the wage to such workman. 66.I hope and expect that in the light of what has been said and a past exercise of the corporation situation where a large number of such employees could be engaged without adherence to any formalities or procedures by the various local managements would be completely eliminated and done away with and this kind of employment in the corporation history would be the last occasion. Excepting the temporary employment the corporation will have no occasion or necessity to employ badly workmen it is hoped in future. Though part time employees will continue to be in existence for some more time as I have indicated, the corporation will also see its own way to absorb the part time employees in its regular employment as far as possible and reduce the number of part time employees to the minimum however, whenever, hereafter any occasion or vacancy arises of regular employment in part time categories and employment, then those who have worked part time in accordance with their seniority should be given preference for absorption in the regular cadre of the Corporation's employment. This should be irrespective of the qualifying age for the entry into corporation's service qualification but subject to his being found suitable.\" Upon the reference under Section 36A of the Act being made by the Ministry of Labour to Justice S. M. Jamdar to clarify the Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule, it was held that the Award of Justice Tulpule was very clear as the same directs only for the absorption of the workmen concerned in the said dispute in the various offices, Divisions and Zones throughout the country. Therefore, it does not amount to recruitment. Aggrieved by the said Award, the Corporation had filed SLP No. 14906 of 1988 before this Court urging various grounds. In the said SLP, this Court in its order dated 1.3.1989 has observed that eight out of the nine workmen Unions said to be representing about 99% of the workers have entered into a compromise with the management of the Corporation. This Court further in the course of the order has observed and permitted the management of the Corporation and the said eight Unions to implement the said compromise by way of an interim measure without any prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of the other Union, who have not entered into such compromise with the Corporation. The relevant terms and conditions of the compromise read thus :- \"The Management agrees to consider the temporary/part-tim/badli workmen employed by the petitioner for 85 days in an two years in a Class III post and for 70 days in any three years in a Class IV post in any of its establishments during the period 1.1.82 to 20.5.85, for regular employment on the basis and in the manner stated hereinbeloe. ... the selection of the candidate shall be made on the basis of the folloing qualifications, age, test, interview and also having regard to the number of days worked by the candidates. A panel of selected candidates shall be made and the selected candidates shall be appointed in regular employment from the pane in the order of merit propectivity from the dates to be notifdies and when vacancies in sanctioned posts for regular employment are filled from time to time\" Pursuant to the above compromise, this Court passed the following order in SLP No. 14906 of 1988 on 1.3.1989 :- \"Special leave is granted. It appears that out of nine Unions eight Unions said to be representing about 99% of the workers have entered into a compromise with the Management. In the circumstances pending the final disposal of the appeal, we permit the Management and the members of the said eight Unions to implement the terms of compromise by way of interim measure without however, any prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of the other Union, who have not entered into such compromise with the management.\" (emphasis laid by this Court) 25\\. From the perusal of the above order of this Court in SLP 14906 of 1988, nowhere it has been stated in the terms of the compromise between the parties that the Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule which was clarified upon reference made by the Central Government under Section 36A of the Act by Justice Jamdar, is either set aside by this Court or substituted the compromise terms in the place of the Award except the order referred to supra passed in the above SLP 14906 of 1988. In fact, on the other hand it is clearly stated that the compromise terms are between the parties to the said SLP and that it shall not prejudice the respective rights and obligations in relation to the members of the other union. Therefore, the effect of the Award of Justice R. D. Tulpule with regard to the direction given to the Corporation regarding absorption of badli, temporary employees as permanent employees has not been substituted by terms and conditions of the compromise. The Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule reiterated by way of clarification in the Award passed by Justice Jamdar in the dispute subsequently has been operative even after the compromise arrived at between the parties to the compromise in the SLP No.14906 of 1988 before this Court. Therefore, the contention of the learned senior counsel on behalf of the Corporation that the said Awards are not in operation and that only the terms and conditions of compromise and orders of this Court are binding upon the concerned workmen in these appeals is not both factually and legally correct. This above said argument of the learned senior counsel on behalf of the Corporation is not tenable in view of the categorical statement made by this Court in its orders passed in SLP referred to supra, wherein, this Court has permitted the management and members of the said 8 Unions to implement the terms of compromise by way of interim measure without any prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of other Union who have not entered into compromise with the management of the Corporation. It is not the case of the Corporation in these appeals either before the CGIT or before the High Court or in these proceedings the concerned workmen have also accepted the said terms and conditions of the compromise arrived between the parties in the SLP No. 14906 of 1988. This Court in the order passed in the above said SLP which is extracted hereinabove has made it very clear that the said compromise entered into between unions therein, but it does not prejudice the rights and contentions of the concerned workmen whose disputes are in relation to their absorption in their respective posts who were appointed after 20.05.1985. Further, even if some of the workmen are bound under the said compromise that arose out of SLP No. 14906 of 1988, this in no way deters their right to raise the industrial dispute and get the same adjudicated vide order of reference by the appropriate Government to the CGIT. The Award of the CGIT was concluded after rightly examining the facts, circumstances of the case and the legal principles laid down in the Awards passed by Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar. More importantly the CGIT Award was passed after rightly appreciating the points of dispute referred to it and on the merits of the case. Furthermore, as per the legal principle laid down by this Court in the case of Bharat Bank (supra), the Industrial Court while adjudicating an industrial dispute has the right to override contracts and create rights which are opposed to contractual rights. The CGIT has rightly adjudicated the industrial dispute referred to it by the Central Government at the instance of the concerned workmen on the points of dispute, on the basis of pleadings and evidence on record and legal principles laid down in the Awards passed by the NIT. The relevant para from the above said case upon which the learned amicus curiae has rightly placed reliance reads thus:- \"9\\. The first contention is that the Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to perform a judicial or quasi- judicial function, since it is not required to be guided by any recognized substantive law in deciding disputes which come before it. On the other hand, in deciding industrial disputes, it has to override contracts and create rights which are opposed to contractual rights. In these circumstances, it is said that the very questions which arose before the Privy Council in [?CITATION?] arise in this case, these questions being: (1) How can the propriety of the Tribunal's decision be tested on appeal, and (2) What are the canons by which the appellate court is to be guided in deciding the appeal? Their Lordships of the Privy Council undoubtedly felt that these were serious questions, but they had no hesitation in saying that \"if it were clear that appeals ought to be allowed, such difficulties would doubtless be met somehow\". This, in my opinion, is a sufficient answer to the difficulty raised. The Tribunal has to adjudicate in accordance with the provisions of the [Industrial Disputes Act] . It may sometimes override contracts, but so can a court which has to administer law according to the Bengal or Bihar Money-lenders Act, Encumbered Estates Act and other similar Acts. The Tribunal has to observe the provisions of the special law which it has to administer though that law may be different from the law which an ordinary court of justice administers. The appellate court, therefore, can at least see that the rules according to which it has to act and the provisions which are binding upon it are observed, and its powers are not exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner. ........ 61\\. We would not examine the process by which an Industrial Tribunal comes to its decisions and I have no hesitation in holding that the process employed is not judicial process at all. In settling the disputes between the employers and the workmen, the function of the Tribunal is not confined to administration of justice in accordance with law. It can confer rights and privileges on either party which it considers reasonable and proper, though they may not be within the terms of any existing agreement. It has not merely to interpret or give effect to the contractual rights and obligations of the parties. It can create new rights and obligations between them which it considers essential for keeping industrial peace..... The Tribunal is not bound by the rigid rules of law. The process it employees is rather an extended form of the process of collective bargaining and is more akin to administrative than to judicial function. In describing the true position of an Industrial Tribunal in dealing with labour disputes, this Court in [?CITATION?] quoted with approval a passage from Ludwig Teller's well known work on the subject, where the learned author observes that \"industrial arbitration may involve the extension of an existing agreement or the making of a new one or in general the creation of new obligations or modification of old ones, while commercial arbitration generally concerns itself with interpretation of existing obligations and disputes relating to existing agreements.\" The views expressed in these observations were adopted in its entirety by this Court. Our conclusion, therefore, is that an Industrial Tribunal formed under the [Industrial Disputes Act]  is not a judicial tribunal and its determination is not a judicial determination in the proper sense of these expressions.\" (emphasis laid by this Court) Therefore, keeping in mind this principle laid down by this Court in the above referred case, we are of the view that the CGIT has rightly overridden the compromise arising out of SLP No. 14906 of 1988 and passed the Award in favour of the concerned workmen. Further, with respect to the E. Prabhavathy case referred to supra, which was filed before this Court, on preliminary hearing of the said case, this Court directed the Corporation to frame a Scheme for regularisation of those employees who were granted ad hoc appointment for 85 days at intervals from time to time. In accordance with the same, a Scheme was framed as per the decision of this Court in the case of State of Haryana v. Piara Singh (supra). The relevant portion of the Scheme is extracted hereunder: \"(a) All those temporary employees who have worked for 85 days in any two consecutive calendar years with the Life Insurance Corporation between 20.5.1985 uptill date and who confronted to the required eligibility criteria for regular recruitment on the dates of their initial temporary appointment will be permitted to compete for the next regular recruitment to be made by the Life Insurance Corporation after the regular recruitment for these posts currently scheduled for November, 1992; (b) These candidates will be considered on their merits with all other candidates who may apply for such appointments, including those from the open market. (c) These candidates will be given an age relaxation for applying for regular recruitment provided that they were eligible on the date of their first temporary appointment for securing regular appointment with the Life Insurance Corporation. (d) If these candidates are otherwise eligible, they can apply for regular recruitment in the normal course.\" Thereafter, this Court granted leave and disposed of the Civil Appeals incorporating the essential features of the Scheme as a part of its order. Further, this Court opined that the said Scheme was also applicable to the case of G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra) and passed an order accordingly and disposed of that case also. The learned senior counsel for the respondents has made his endeavour by taking us through the said scheme which was framed on the basis of the decision of this Court in the case of Piara Singh's case (supra) and that the same was prevalent in 1992. It is pertinent to note that the said Scheme framed in the E. Prabhavathy case (supra) was the outcome of the order passed in Writ Petition filed by the concerned workmen in those cases and not the adjudication of the industrial dispute as per points of dispute referred to the CGIT/NIT by the Appropriate Government as per Section 10 of the Act. Therefore, placing reliance on the above Scheme by the learned senior counsel on behalf of the Corporation in justification of the impugned judgment and order of the High Court and the said Scheme formulated by the Corporation being accepted by the workmen in those proceedings does not in any way take away the statutory and fundamental rights of the concerned workmen in these appeals, who have raised the industrial dispute for their absorption into regular permanent posts of Class III and Class IV of the Corporation. Further, by a careful reading of the said order in the SLP No. 14906 of 1988, it has been made clear that the Awards passed by the NIT (by Justice Jamdar and Justice Tulpule) after adjudicating the points of dispute in the industrail dispute raised by similarly placed workmen is not disturbed by substituting the terms and conditions of compromise between the parties therein in SLP No.14906 of 1988. Therefore, the Awards in relation to the absorption of the workmen as permanent workmen in the Corporation have got statutory force. This is what is stated by the CGIT in its Award on the basis of pleadings and evidence on record, which was erroneously set aside by the High Court by assigning erroneous reasons which is sought to be justified by the senior counsel on behalf of the Corporation by placing reliance upon the orders and Scheme framed in E. Prabhavathy & Ors. and G. Sudhakar & Ors. cases which scheme has no application to the case of the concerned workmen involved in these appeals referred to supra. Therefore, the learned amicus curiae Mr. Naphade has rightly placed reliance upon the decision of this Court in the case of D. J. Bahadur (supra) to substantiate his legal contention that the Awards passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule and reiterated by Justice Jamdar by clarifying the same in the reference under Section 36A of the Act are still binding upon the parties as the same have neither been set aside nor terminated by either of the parties or orders of this Court or Scheme framed by the Corporation. The relevant paragraphs of the above said case are extracted hereunder: \"138\\. The court then proceeded to consider specifically the situation that would obtain in the 3rd period in relation to an award and held: \"Quite apart from this, however, it appears to us that even if an award has ceased to be in operation or in force and has ceased to be binding on the parties under the provisions of Section 19(6) it will continue to have its effect as a contract between the parties that has been made by industrial adjudication in place of the old contract. So long as the award remains in operation under Section 19(3), Section 23(c) stands in the way of any strike by the workmen and lock-out by the employer in respect of any matter covered by the award. Again, so long as the award is binding on a party, breach of any of its terms will make the party liable to penalty under Section 29 of the Act, to imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine or with both. After the period of its operation and also the period for which the award is binding have elapsed Section 23 and Section 29 can have no operation. We can however see nothing in the scheme of the [Industrial Disputes Act]  to justify a conclusion that merely because these special provisions as regards prohibition of strikes and lock-outs and of penalties for breach of award cease to be effective the new contract as embodied in the award should also cease to be effective. On the contrary, the very purpose for which industrial adjudication has been given the peculiar authority and right of making new contracts between employers and workmen makes it reasonable to think that even though the period of operation of the award and the period for which it remains binding on the parties - in respect of both of which special provisions have been made under Sections 23 and 29 respectively - may expire, the new contract would continue to govern the relations between the parties till it is displaced by another contract. The objection that no such benefit as claimed could accrue to the respondent after March 31, 1959 must therefore be rejected.\" 139\\. It is the underlined portion of this paragraph which impelled the High Court to come to the conclusion that even a notice under Section 19(6) of the ID Act would not terminate a settlement (which, according to the High Court, stands on the same footing as an award and, in fact is indistinguishable there from for the purpose of Section 19) but would have the effect of merely paving the way for fresh negotiations resulting ultimately in a new settlement - a conclusion which has been seriously challenged on behalf of the Corporation with the submission that Chacko case has no application whatsoever to the present controversy inasmuch as the special law comprised of Sections 11 and 49 of the LIC Act fully covers the situation in the 3rd period following the expiry of the 1974 settlements. The submission is well based. In Chacko case this Court was dealing with the provisions of the ID Act alone when it made the observations last extracted and was not concerned with a situation which would cover the 3rd period in relation to an award (or for that matter a settlement) in accordance with a specific mandate from Parliament. The only available course for filling the void created by the Sastry Award was a continuation of its terms till they were replaced by something else legally enforceable which, in the circumstances before the court, could only be another contract (in the shape of an award [pic]or a settlement), there being no legal provision requiring the void to be filled otherwise. In the present case the law intervenes to indicate how the void which obtains in the 3rd period shall be filled and, if it has been so filled, there is no question of its being filled in the manner indicated in Chacko case wherein, as already pointed out, no such law was available. The observations in that case must thus be taken to mean that the expired award would continue to govern the parties till it is displaced by another contract or by a relationship otherwise substituted for it in accordance with law.\" In view of the statement of law laid down by this Court in the above referred case, the reliance placed upon para 43 and 47 of D. J. Bahadur case and other cases relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the Corporation are misplaced and the same do not support the case of the Corporation. 27\\. In view of the law laid by this Court in the case referred to supra, both the Award of Justice Tulpule reiterated by way of clarification Award by Justice Jamdar are still operative as the same are not terminated by either of the parties as provided under Section 19(6) of the Act. The compromise between the parties in SLP No. 14906 of 1988 and the Scheme formed in E. Prabhavathy & Ors. and G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra) do not amount to substitution of the Awards passed by Justice R. D. Tulpule and by Justice S. M. Jamdar. Hence, in view of the aforesaid reasons, the submissions made by Mr. Naphade, learned amicus curiae, in justification of the Award passed by the CGIT is based on the terms and conditions laid down in the Awards passed by the NIT (by Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar) in favour of the workmen for absorption as they have been rendering their service to the Corporation in the perennial nature of work for a number of years and hence, the High Court was not justified in interfering with the said Award passed by the CGIT. The said contention urged by the learned amicus curiae is accepted by us, as the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is contrary to the Awards referred to supra, the provisions of the [Industrial Disputes Act]  of the Act. Until then, the said Award passed by the NIT will still be operative in law. Therefore, the same has been rightly applied to the fact situation on hand in the Award passed by the CGIT and it could not have been set aside by the High Court. Thus, we are of the opinion that the learned single Judge erroneously set aside the Award passed by the CGIT and the said judgment of the learned single judge has been further erroneously affirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court. The said judgments of the High Court are clearly contrary to law and legal principles laid down by this Court in cases referred to supra. Hence, the same are liable to be set aside by allowing these appeals and restoring the Award of the CGIT. 28\\. The learned amicus curiae rightly placed reliance upon entry Item No.10 of Schedule V of the Act in employing the concerned workmen as temporary, badli and part-time employees against permanent posts doing perennial nature of work and continuing them as such for number of years. This is a clear case of unfair labour practice as defined under Section 2(ra) of the Act which is statutorily prohibited under Section 25T of the Act and the said action of the Corporation amounts to penalty under Section 25U of the Act. For this reason also, the findings and reasons recorded in the Award of the CGIT in answering the points of dispute referred to it by Central Government in favour of the concerned workmen is legal and valid. The High Court has erred in not noticing the aforesaid important, relevant, factual and legal aspect of the case of the concerned workmen and has erroneously set aside the Award of the CGIT passed in favour of the concerned workmen in exercise of its judicial power. The High Court has erred in not following the legal principles laid down by this Court in the case of [?CITATION?], wherein it is held thus:- \"17\\. Before concluding, we consider it necessary to observe that while exercising jurisdiction under Articles 226 and/or 227 of the Constitution in matters like the present one, the High Courts are duty bound to keep in mind that the [Industrial Disputes Act] , 43 and 43A in particular, which mandate that the State should secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people, ensure equality between men and women and equitable distribution of material resources of the community to sub-serve the common good and also ensure that the workers get their dues. More than 41 years ago, Gajendragadkar, J, opined that \"the concept of social and economic justice is a living concept of revolutionary import; it gives sustenance to the rule of law and meaning and significance to the ideal of welfare State\" [?CITATION?]\" The said principle has been reiterated by this Court recently in the case of [?CITATION?] For the aforesaid reasons also, the case of the concerned workmen/appellants must succeed and the impugned judgment and order must be set aside. Accordingly, it is set aside. Answer to point (iii) It is needless to mention that since we are of the view that the Award passed by the CGIT in I.D. No. 27 of 1991 is legal and valid, it shall be restored and implemented by the Corporation by absorbing the concerned workmen in the permanent posts and if they have attained the age of superannuation, the Corporation will be liable to pay all consequential benefits including monetary benefits taking into consideration the pay scale and revised pay scale from time to time by the Corporation. Mr. Shekar Naphade, learned amicus curiae has rendered excellent assistance to this Court at our request to arrive at just conclusions in these cases. The same is appreciated and placed on record. This Judgment and order shall be implemented within eight weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of this Judgment and the compliance report of the same shall be submitted for perusal of this Court. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed in the above said terms. All the applications are disposed of. No costs. ..................................................................J. [V.

      "Paragraph 1: As in all the above appeals the issue that arises for consideration is the applicability of the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, 1999 (hereinafter called \"MCOCA\"), all these appeals are disposed of by this common judgment.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70/2010 have been preferred by Lt. Col. Prasad Shrikant Purohit challenging the judgment in Criminal Appeal No.867 of 2009 which was disposed of by the common order passed by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal Nos.866, 867, 868, 869 and 1024 of 2009 dated 19.07.2010. By the said order the Division Bench reversed the order of the Special Judge dated 31.7.2009 passed in Special Case No.1 of 2009 wherein he held that the charges against the accused in C.R.No.18 of 2008 registered with Anti-Terrorist Squad, Mumbai (hereinafter referred to as \"ATS\") under the MCOCA do not survive and were discharged from the case.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: The Special Court by invoking Section 11 of the MCOCA directed the case to be tried by the regular Court. The Division Bench while allowing the Criminal Appeal Nos.866 to 869 of 2009 set aside the order of the Special Judge 31.07.2009 in Special Case No.1 of 2009 as well as orders passed in Bail Application Nos.40 to 42 of 2008, restored those applications to the file in MCOCA Special Case No. 01 of 2009 for being decided on merits by Special Judge himself. In Criminal Appeal No.1024 of 2009 while allowing the said appeal, Bail Application No.41 of 2008 was directed to be restored in MCOCA Special Case No. 01 of 2009 for being heard and decided on merits.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: The appellant-Lt. Col. Prasad Shrikant Purohit is the first respondent in Criminal Appeal No.867 of 2009.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: The appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.9370-71/2011 have also been preferred by the very same appellant, namely, Lt. Col. Prasad Shrikant Purohit challenging the common order passed in Criminal Bail Application No.333 of 2011 with Criminal Application No.464 of 2011 along with Criminal Application No.556 of 2011 dated 9th November 2011 by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court. By the said order the learned Judge allowed the Criminal Application No.556 of 2011 filed by Ajay Ekanath Rahirkar by granting him bail by imposing certain conditions. In the case of appellant herein, the challenge made in Criminal Application No.464 of 2011 was the order of the Special Judge after the order of remand passed by the Division Bench dated 19.07.2010. The Special Judge by the order dated 30.12.2010 rejected the appellant's application for bail. The learned Single Judge after detailed discussion, dismissed the Criminal Bail Application No.333 of 2011 as well as Criminal Application No.464 of 2011 by the order impugned in these appeals.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: The appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8132/2010 has been filed by one Pragyasinh Chandrapalsinh Thakur challenging the common order dated 19.07.2010 passed by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No.866 of 2009 which is identical to the case of the appellant in Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70 of 2010.\n",

      "Paragraph 8: The appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.9303/2011 is preferred by one Sudhakar Dhar Dwivedi and Ramesh Shivji Upadhyay challenging the order dated 20.10.2011 of the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court. By the said judgment, the learned Single Judge declined to interfere with the order of Special Judge in Misc. Application No.98/2011 permitting police custody to the first respondent, namely, National Investigation Agency (NIA) for 8 days from 22.07.2011 up to 30.07.2011. In fact, the said case was originally investigated by ATS and final report was submitted on 30.01.2009 and supplementary charge-sheet vide MCOCA No.8/2011 was filed on 21.4.2011. Thereafter by order dated 1.4.2011 of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, investigation was transferred to NIA and an FIR was registered as Crime No.5/2011 by police station NIA on 13.4.2011.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: Thereafter NIA sought for police custody which was granted by order passed in Misc. Application No.98/2011 dated 19.07.2011. The said SLP is not argued before us and, therefore, the same is delinked from this batch of cases and the same shall be heard separately.\n",

      "Paragraph 12: Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel in his submissions referred to the brief facts which led to the initiation of the proceedings against the appellants under the provisions of MCOCA. As the narration goes, there was a bomb blast at the place called Malegaon in Mumbai on 29.9.2008. With reference to the said occurrence, FIR No.130/2008 was registered in the Azad Nagar police station in Malegaon on 30.9.2008. On 26.10.2008, the said FIR was transferred and registered as C.R. No. 18/2008 and the investigation was taken over by ATS. Thereafter the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1971/2010, namely, one Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade was arrested by ATS on 02.11.2008. Subsequent to his arrest, the appellant in Crl. Appeal Nos. 1969-1970/2010 was arrested on 05.11.2008. On 20.11.2008, approval was given as per Section 23(1) (a) of MCOCA by DIG, ATS for recording of information about the commission of an offence and for applying the provisions of Section 3(1)(i),3(2) and 3(4) of MCOCA against all the accused in C.R. No. 18/2008.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: Be that as it may, earlier on 21.11.2003, there was a bomb explosion at Mohmedia Masjid, Nanalpeth, Parbhani which was registered as C.R. No.161 of 2003/Parbhani. There was another bomb explosion at Kaderia Masjid, Jalna during Friday Namaz which was registered as C.R.No. 194 of 2004/Jalna.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: In the case pertaining to Parbhani, the charge-sheet was filed on 07.09.2006 against A1-Sanjay Choudhary for the offences punishable under Sections 302, 307, 324, 337, 338, 285, 286 and 295 read with 34, IPC and Sections 3, 4, 6 of the Explosives Act and Section 25(1) and (3) of the Arms Act. The case was registered as RCC No.467/2006. A supplementary chargesheet-I was filed in Parbhani case against four accused for the above referred to offences as well as Sections 120-B & 153-A read with 34 of IPC on 29.9.2006.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: In Jalna case, charge-sheet was filed against A-1 for the offences punishable under Sections 307, 436, 324, 323, 120-B, 153-A read with 34 of IPC and Sections 3, 4, 6 of Explosives Act on 30.9.2006. In Jalna case, two supplementary charge-sheets were filed on 7.1.2008 against four additional accused and against five accused on 14.1.2008. On 13.11.2008, supplementary charge-sheet-2 was filed against the appellant in Crl. Appeal No.1971 of 2010-Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade in Parbhani Case and a supplementary charge- sheet-3 was filed against him in Jalna Case on 15.11.2008. Thereafter, on 20.11.2008, charge-sheet in Malegaon Blast Case was filed by ATS against the appellants herein under the MCOCA. On 15.01.2009, sanction under Section 23(2) of MCOCA was also granted.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: In the above stated background, Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel made as many as five submissions to contend that MCOCA was not attracted as against the appellants and, therefore, the orders impugned are liable to be set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel prefaced his submissions by stating that appellants were all proceeded against based on the footing that they were members of an organization called \"Abhinav Bharat\" which was registered in 2007 and that they were now being prosecuted under the provisions of MCOCA. The learned senior counsel submitted that in order to prosecute the appellants under the MCOCA, the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\", \"organized crime\" and \"organized crime syndicate\" as defined under Section 2(1)(d),(e) and (f) of MCOCA should be satisfied. The learned senior counsel while referring to the above definitions submitted that the prosecuting agency were relying upon the Parbhani case and Jalna case which occurred in 2003 and 2004 and which were organized by RSS and Bajrang Dal with which neither Abhinav Bharat nor the appellants were in anyway connected and, therefore, the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\" or \"organized crime\" as well as \"organized crime syndicate\" was not fully established.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: The next submission of Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel was that in order to attract Section 2(1)(d) for an offence to be a 'continuing unlawful activity' within a period of preceding ten years from the date of the third occurrence, two prior cases falling under the said Section should have been filed and taken cognizance of and that the date with reference to which the preceding ten years is to be counted is the date of third occurrence. The learned senior counsel, therefore, submitted that the Malegaon bomb blast occurred on 29.09.2008, the arrest of Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade was on 02.11.2008, supplementary charge-sheet against him was filed in Parbhani case on 13.11.2008 and in Jalna case on 15.11.2008 and in Parbhani, the case was committed to Sessions Court only on 29.4.2009 i.e.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: not within the preceding 10 years of the occurrence in Malegaon and, therefore, the definition of Section 2(1) (d) was not satisfied. Even with reference to Jalna, the learned senior counsel submitted that the Express Order of cognizance was taken only on 28.11.2008 i.e. after the occurrence in Malegaon, namely, 29.09.2008. Therefore, the requirement of preceding ten years in order to bring the earlier two occurrences in Parbhani and Jalna within the definition of 2(1)(d) as continuing unlawful activities was not made out. The learned senior counsel in this context submitted that the conclusion of the Division Bench that cognizance is always with reference to the offence and not the offender, is not the correct legal position. The learned senior counsel after referring to Sections 173(2)(i)(a), 190(1)(b) and 178 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) submitted that a close reading of the above Sections shows that the cognizance will be with reference to the offender and not the offence. The learned senior counsel, therefore, submitted that in the case of Jalna the Express Order of cognizance was taken on 28.11.2008 after the supplementary charge-sheet dated 15.11.2008 against Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade, which was long after the date of occurrence of Malegaon, namely, 29.09.2008, and, therefore, the requirement of two earlier cases as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) was not satisfied. The learned senior counsel relied upon the decisions in  [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] in support of his submissions.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel then contended that the event of cognizance being taken as defined under Section 2(1) (d) can only be with reference to 'competent court' and in the case of Parbhani and Jalna as the offences were under Sections 302, 307/308 etc., Sessions Court was the competent court and not the Chief Judicial Magistrate. The learned senior counsel pointed out that in the case of Parbhani, the committal order was passed only on 29.04.2009 i.e. long after the Malegaon case occurrence, namely, 29.09.2008. Therefore, the requirement of two earlier cases which were taken cognizance of by the competent court cannot be held to have been satisfied. In support of the said submission, learned senior counsel relied upon [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 21: The learned senior counsel then contended that in order to attract the provisions of MCOCA, in all the three cases, the same gang must have been involved. Elaborating his submission, the learned senior counsel contended that Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade who has been added as A-7 in Malegaon case was arrested on 02.11.2008 and his arrest was shown in Parbhani and in Jalna on 13.11.2008 and 15.11.2008 as directed by the Additional Police Commissioner of ATS and even going by the statement of A-7, he procured some materials and gave them to one principal accused in Parbhani and Jalna, namely, Devle and going by the said statement, there is no scope to link the appellant with the cases which related to Parbhani and Jalna and, therefore, the requirement of involvement of the same gang in all the three cases was not satisfied. The learned senior counsel submitted that in any event, the appellants were not concerned with Parbhani and Jalna, that they were not even aware of A-7's involvement in those two occurrences, as they were not members of those gangs which were involved in Parbhani and Jalna and, therefore, the invocation of MCOCA was not made out. The learned senior counsel further contended that it was all the more reason to hold that cognizance should be with reference to the offender and not the offence which has to be mandatorily satisfied.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: The learned senior counsel lastly submitted that going by the definition of 'organized crime' under Section 2(1) (e), there must have been a pecuniary gain accompanied by the act of violence, that the appellant had not taken any money from anybody and when such pecuniary advantage should have been present in all the three cases, it cannot be held that the case against the appellant would come under the definition of 'organized crime'. According to learned senior counsel, in the case of Parbhani and Jalna, only violence was the basis and promoting insurgency was not even the case of prosecution which may have a semblance of application in Malegaon case and certainly not in Parbhani and Jalna. The learned senior counsel, therefore, contended that the application of MCOCA as against the appellants was wholly inappropriate and consequently, the order of the Division Bench and the subsequent order of the Special Court in declining to grant bail was liable to be set aside. The learned senior counsel submitted that the appellants made out a case to show that there were reasonable grounds for believing that he was not guilty of such offence under MCOCA and as provided under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA and should have been granted bail. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the appellant in Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70 of 2010 as well as in SLP (Crl.) Nos.9370-71 of 2011 has been in jail for more than six years and he is entitled for grant of bail.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: Mr. Triloki Nath Razdan, learned counsel appearing for the appellants in the appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.9303/2011 while adopting the arguments of Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel for the appellant in Crl.A.No.1969-70/2010 contended that the Objects and Reasons of MCOCA shows that the very purport of the enactment was to curb the accumulation of illegal wealth, that in order to attract the provisions of MCOCA, involvement in organized crime by an organized crime syndicate in all the three cases must be satisfied. By referring to the sanction order dated 15.01.2009, learned counsel submitted that when the arrest of Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade was in the month of November, 2008, the requirement of Section 2(1) (d) relating to two previous cases of continuing unlawful activity was not satisfied. In other words, according to learned counsel, as the requirement of continuing unlawful activity in respect of an organized crime by the organized crime syndicate was not shown, MCOCA was not attracted. The learned counsel relied upon in [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] & [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 24: Mr. Patil, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant in SLP (Crl.) No.8132/2010 referred to the impugned judgment of the Division Bench, in particular, paragraph 18 and submitted that the question which was posed for consideration by the Division Bench was limited to the extent of examining the issue of taking cognizance of the offences by the Chief Judicial Magistrate at Parbhani and its counterpart at Jalna. Sofaras the appellant in the present appeal was concerned, learned senior counsel submitted that she became a Sanyasin after performing appropriate Hindu religious rites and prayers on 30.01.2007, that she was residing in an ashram at Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh and that she owned a two wheeler LML- Freedom which she sold out to one Sunil Joshi of Madhya Pradesh way back in October, 2004 for a sale consideration of Rs.24,000/- and she also signed the necessary transfer application Forms in October, 2004 itself and that thereafter she had no control over the said vehicle. The learned senior counsel submitted that inspite of her disclosing the above facts, the officials of ATS applied third degree methods upon her and insisted that the said vehicle was involved in Malegaon blast occurrence and, therefore, she was also involved in the said occurrence. The learned senior counsel submitted that she was implicated in the Malegaon case while she is innocent simply because the vehicle bearing registration No.MH-15-P-4572, which she owned, was stated to have been involved in the Malegaon blast.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: The learned senior counsel then submitted that if the Objects and Reasons is read for interpreting Section 3, a strict application of the Act should be made, in which event, in order to invoke the provisions of MCOCA Section 2(1)(d), (e) and (f) should be satisfied. It was contended that for implicating a person it is to be mandatorily shown that he was involved in a 'continuing unlawful activity' as a member of crime syndicate or on behalf of it on two earlier occasions, that the appellant was not involved in either the Parbhani case or in Jalna case and, therefore, the invocation of MCOCA against the appellant was not maintainable. The learned senior counsel also submitted that having regard to the relevant dates with reference to the committal order in Jalna case, namely, 11.8.2008, the subsequent charge-sheet against A-7 on 15.11.2008 on which date the case was registered afresh as RCC No.648/2008 and on 28.11.2008 when committal order was passed, the sanction order in Malegaon case being 20.11.2008, there was no scope to hold that there were two earlier cases falling within the definition of continuing unlawful activity as defined under Section 2(1)(d) of the Act. The learned senior counsel, therefore, contended that the order of the trial Court dated 31.07.2009 discharging all the accused was justified and the Division Bench ought not to have interfered with the said order.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: The learned senior counsel also submitted that the Division Bench having noted that the offence under Section 153A, IPC was not laid after getting prior sanction as required under Section 196 Cr.P.C. even as against A-7 Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade, there was no valid cognizance taken by the trial Court in respect of the earlier cases of Parbhani and Jalna. The learned Senior Counsel, therefore, contended that in the absence of the 'continuing unlawful activity' as defined under Section 2(1)(d) of an 'organized crime' by 'organized crime syndicate' shown, application of MCOCA was not justified. As far as the preceding 10 years as prescribed under Section 2(1)(d) is concerned, learned senior counsel submitted that Section 2(1)(d) specifically refers to 'activity' for calculating the preceding 10 years and, therefore, 29.09.2008 would be the relevant date and calculated on that basis the claim of the prosecution that there were two earlier cases as stipulated under Section 2 (1)(d) was not satisfied. In support of this submission, learned senior counsel relied upon the decisions of this Court reported as [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and Tolaram Relumal & [?CITATION?] Mr. Vikas Mehta, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010, namely, Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade after making reference to the judgment in Mahipal Singh (supra) contended that prior to the registration of FIR No.130 of 2008 on 30.09.2008 in the Malegaon blast case, the appellant was not involved in any 'continuing unlawful activity'.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: According to him, if a strict interpretation is to be placed on the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' as stated in the said decision of this Court, the appellant having been not involved in the commission of any offence prior to registration of FIR No.130/2008 either singly or jointly as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate, invocation of MCOCA was not justified. The learned counsel then contended that in order to invoke MCOCA all the three definitions of Section 2 (1) (d), (e) and (f) should be satisfied in which event it should be by the same gang in all the three cases. The learned counsel then contended that since strict interpretation is to be made as directed by this Court while upholding the validity of the Act, it should be construed only in that manner. The learned counsel by relying upon the decisions in Ranjitsing Brahamjeetsing Sharma (supra), Lalit Somdatta Nagpal (supra) and Mahipal Singh (supra) contended that the requirement of satisfaction of 'continuing unlawful activity' of an 'organized crime' by an 'organized crime syndicate' insofar as it related to the appellant was not made out and the application of the MCOCA was not justified. Mr. S.S. Shamshery, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.58/2011 submitted that he is adopting the arguments of Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel for appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1969-70 of 2010 and the judgment of the Division Bench is liable to be set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: As against the above submissions made on behalf of the appellants, Mr. Anil Singh, learned ASG for the respondent State submitted that the Division Bench after formulating the question in paragraph 18 ascertained the relevant dates when cognizance was taken in Parbhani case and in Jalna case by the Committal Court and in both the cases cognizance was taken as early as on 07.09.2006 in Parbhani and on 30.9.2006 in Jalna which were borne out by records and, therefore, the Division Bench was justified in setting aside the order of the Special Court. In support of his submission that taking a fresh cognizance is not a requirement of law in a case where cognizance is already taken in respect of the same offence, reliance was placed upon [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]; [[?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 29: According to learned ASG, in respect of an offence under MCOCA, for invoking its provisions, cognizance of the offence taken as provided under Section 190 Cr.P.C. was sufficient. The learned ASG then submitted that in order to ascertain a 'continuing unlawful activity' as defined under Section 2 (1) (d) of the MCOCA what is required is commission of such an offence as a member of either 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of 'organized crime syndicate' would mean any 'organized crime syndicate' and not the same 'organized crime syndicate'. As far as the contention relating to two earlier cases in the preceding 10 years, the learned ASG submitted that in the Malegaon case, the occurrence was on 29.09.2008 and in the preceding 10 years i.e. on 07.09.2006 cognizance was taken in the Parbhani case and in Jalna case cognizance was taken on 30.09.2006 and, therefore, the same was sufficient to hold that the appellants were involved in a 'continuing unlawful activity' and thereby satisfied the requirement of 2 (1) (d) (e) and (f) of MCOCA. The learned ASG sought to distinguish the case in Mahipal Singh (supra). The learned ASG by relying upon [?CITATION?] submitted that insurgency is a grave disturbance of public order and, therefore, the question of pecuniary advantage was not needed where promotion of insurgency formed the basis for prosecuting the appellants under MCOCA. On 'other advantage', learned ASG relied upon [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 30: Mr. Mariaarputham, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of Maharashtra and NIA after referring to the accusations against the accused submitted that going by the allegations and the gravity of the offence, they are not entitled for bail. The learned senior counsel also submitted that apart from offences under the MCOCA, the appellants are also proceeded under the [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967]  of MCOCA, it is not necessary that for the commission of such aggressive offences, there should be allegation of pecuniary advantage also.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: According to learned senior counsel, insofar as, promotion of insurgency is concerned, even without any allegation of pecuniary gain, the said act by itself would constitute an 'organized crime'. The learned senior counsel, therefore, contended that even in the absence of any allegation of pecuniary gain, the offence alleged would fall under the category of 'organized crime'. The learned senior counsel further contended that in any event there were materials to show that the appellant in Criminal Appeal 1969-70/2010 as well as the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010 had pecuniary advantage. The learned senior counsel then contended that cognizance of the offence was taken by the Magistrate based on the charge- sheet and when once there was application of judicial mind with a view to proceed with the matter, the requirement of cognizance was fulfilled.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: Insofar as the offences pertaining to Parbhani and Jalna were concerned, the learned senior counsel contended that they were all IPC offences and, therefore, taking cognizance of those offences need not be tested on the anvil of the provisions of MCOCA. The learned senior counsel placed reliance upon the decisions in [?CITATION?]. He also placed reliance upon [?CITATION?],[?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 33: On the submission relating to competent Court, learned senior counsel submitted that in Parbhani and Jalna reference needs to be made only to Sections 190, 200, 201, 202 read with Section 4 Cr.P.C. and when on a complaint filed by the prosecution, the CJM having taken cognizance, the same was sufficient for the fulfillment of requirement of the 'continuing unlawful activity' as defined under Section 2 (1) (d) of the MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: According to learned senior counsel, for the purpose of taking cognizance under the above provisions, the presence of the accused was not necessary.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: As far as the relevant date is concerned, according to learned senior counsel, even if the date of occurrence of Malegaon blast, namely, 29.9.2008 is taken as the relevant date, the committal Court having taken cognizance by receipt of the charge-sheet dated 07.09.2006 in respect of Parbhani and on 30.09.2006 in the case of Jalna and the committal order was on 12.02.2007 in Jalna, the cognizance was well before 29.09.2008 and, therefore, there was nothing lacking for the purpose of invoking the provisions of MCOCA. The learned senior counsel further contended that as long as all the three incidents were committed by a group of persons and one common individual was involved in all the three incidents, that would attract invocation of MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned ASG also appearing for NIA submitted that in the event of granting bail, having regard to the nature of offence alleged to have been indulged in by the appellants, severe conditions should be imposed and that the agency is entitled for custodial interrogation and also the presence of the accused at the time of trial should be ensured.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: By way of reply Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel submitted that the prosecution has not shown involvement of 'Abhinav Bharat' in the Parbhani case or Jalna case in which event if 'Abhinav Bharat' is to be excluded, the linking of the appellants by making reference to Abhinav Bharat will also entitle them to contend that MCOCA cannot be invoked. The learned senior counsel submitted that since MCOCA has been invoked for the purpose of ascertaining the cognizance of the offence, reference to Section 2(1)(d) would alone be made and not under Section 190 Cr.P.C. The learned senior counsel further contended that cognizance by the competent Court in the facts and the nature of offence alleged in Parbhani and Jalna would only mean the Sessions Court under Section 209 Cr.P.C. and, therefore, there is a serious doubt as to the application of MCOCA. The learned senior counsel, therefore, contended that such doubt should be held in favour of the appellants under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA and the appellants should be granted bail.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Mr. Patil, learned senior counsel for the appellant in appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8132/2010 submitted that when the case of the said appellant is considered with reference to additional charge-sheet, appellant being a lady suffering from cancer and her implication was because of sale of her two wheeler four years before the occurrence, applying the decision in Salap Service Station (supra), she is entitled for the grant of bail.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: Having noted the submissions of respective counsel, at the outset, we want to note the specific challenges made in these appeals. As far as the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1969-70 of 2010 is concerned, he along with the other appellants is aggrieved by the common judgment of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Crl.A. Nos.866, 867, 868, 869 and 1024 of 2009 dated 19.07.2010. By the said judgment, the Division Bench set aside the order of the Special Judge dated 31.07.2009 in Special Case No.1/2009.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: While setting aside the said order of the Special Judge, the Division Bench directed the Special Judge to consider the bail applications in Bail Application Nos.40-42 of 2008 and pass orders on merits. In fact, the Special Judge in his order dated 31.07.2009 took the view that MCOCA was not applicable to Special Case No.1/2009 and consequently by invoking Section 11 of MCOCA, directed the case to be tried by the regular Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: Therefore, when we examine the correctness of the judgment of the Division Bench dated 19.07.2010 in Crl. A Nos.866/2009 and connected appeals, if the said judgment is to be upheld, the consequence would be to the consideration of the bail applications under Section 21 of the MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: It is relevant to note that after the order of the Division Bench dated 19.7.2010, the Special Judge dealt with the Bail Applications Nos. 40-42 of 2008 and dismissed all the applications. Thereafter, those orders were the subject matter of challenge in Criminal Bail Application No.333/2011 with Criminal Application No.464/2011 insofar as the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1969-70/2010 is concerned. One other appellant namely, Ajay Eknath Rahirkar filed Criminal Application No.556/2011 which was allowed by the Bombay High Court and he was granted bail by imposing certain conditions. As far as Criminal Application No.333/2011 was concerned, the said application was rejected and the main Criminal Application No.464/2011 was disposed of by the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: The appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971 of 2010 was one of the respondents in Criminal Appeal No.868 of 2009 which was disposed of by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court by its order dated 19.07.2010 along with the connected appeals preferred by the State of Maharashtra through ATS which is the prosecuting agency in respect of the Special Case No.1 of 2009 on the file of the Special Judge under MCOCA. The said appellant was also aggrieved by the order of the Division Bench referred to above in having set aside the order of the Special Judge dated 31.07.2009. The appellant in the appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.8132/2010 is also similarly placed like that of the appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70/2010 and Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: Having thus noted the grievances of the appellants in the above referred to appeals as against the order of the Division Bench dated 19.07.2010 as well as the subsequent order of the learned Single Judge in having declined to grant bail by confirming the order of the Special Court in Bail Application No.42 of 2008, from the above referred to details gathered from the appeal papers as well as the orders impugned in these appeals the scope for consideration in these appeals pertains to the questions:- Whether the common order of the Division Bench dated 19.07.2010 in having set aside the order of the Special Judge in Special Case No.1 of 2009 discharging the appellants from the said case on the ground that MCOCA was not applicable to the said case and consequently the case was to be tried by the Regular Court under Section 11 of MCOCA calls for interference? If answer to question No. (a) is in the negative, whether for the purpose of grant of bail under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA, can it be held that the application of the said Act is not made out against the appellants and consequently the rejection of bail by the trial Court and as confirmed by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court is justified? Having thus ascertained the scope involved in these appeals by virtue of the orders impugned herein, when we consider the submissions of learned counsel for the appellants, we find that the sum and substance of the submissions can be summarized as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 45: \"That the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity', 'organized crime' or 'organized crime syndicate' as defined under Section 2(1)(d)(e) and (f) of MCOCA was not cumulatively satisfied in order to proceed with the Special Case No.1 of 2009 for the alleged commission of offence of organized crime under Section 3 of MCOCA.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 46: In order to find an answer to the said question a detailed reference to some of the provisions of MCOCA, its Objects and Reasons and some other provisions of the Cr.P.C. are required to be noted.

As far as the Cr.P.C. is concerned, reference will have to be made to Sections 4, 173(2) & (8), 190, 191, 192, 193, 200, 201 and 209. In order to appreciate the said provisions the same are extracted as under:\n",

      "Paragraph 91: In the first instance, it will be profitable to examine the scheme of MCOCA by making a cursory glance to the Objects and Reasons and thereafter to make an intensive reading of the above referred to provisions. When we peruse the Objects and Reasons, it discloses that organized crime has been posing very serious threat to our society for quite some years and it was also noted that organized crime syndicates had a common cause with terrorist gangs. In the Objects and Reasons, the foremost consideration was the serious threat to the society by those who were indulging in organized crimes in the recent years apart from organized crime criminals operating hand in glove with terrorist gangs. It is common knowledge that for the terrorist gangs, the sole object is to create panic in the minds of peace loving members of the society and in that process attempt to achieve some hidden agenda which cannot be easily identified, but certainly will not be in the general interest or well being of the society. Those who prefer to act in such clandestine manner and activities will formulate their own mind- set and ill-will towards others and attempt to achieve their objectives by indulging in unlawful hazardous criminal activities unmindful of the serious consequences and in majority of such cases it results in severe loss of life of innocent people apart from extensive damage to the properties of public at large. It was further found that the existing legal framework, that is the penal and procedural laws and the adjudicatory system, were found to be inadequate to curb or control the menace of 'organized crime'. The Objects and Reasons also states that such 'organized crimes' were filled by illegal wealth generated by contract killing, extrusion, smuggling in contraband, illegal trade in narcotics, kidnapping for ransom, collection of protection money, money laundering etc. Keeping the above serious repercussions referred to in the Objects and Reasons, when we examine Section 2(1)(d)(e)&(f), which defines 'continuing unlawful activity', 'organized crime' or 'organized crime syndicate', we find that the three definitions are closely interlinked.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: The definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' under Section 2(1)(d) mainly refers to an activity prohibited by law. The said activity should be a cognizable offence, punishable with imprisonment of three years or more.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: The commission of such offence should have been undertaken either by an individual singly or by joining with others either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or even if as an individual or by joining hands with others even if not as a member of a 'organized crime syndicate' such commission of an offence should have been on behalf of such syndicate. It further states that in order to come within the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' there should have been more than one charge-sheet filed before a competent Court within the preceding period of 10 years and that the said Court should have taken cognizance of such offence.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: Before getting into the nuances of the said definition of 'continuing unlawful activity', it will be worthwhile to get a broad idea of the definition of 'organized crime' under Section 2(1)(e) and 'organized crime syndicate' under Section 2(1)(f). An 'organized crime' should be any 'continuing unlawful activity' either by an individual singly or jointly, either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of such syndicate. The main ingredient of the said definition is that such 'continuing unlawful activity' should have been indulged in by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means. Further such violence and other activity should have been indulged in with an objective of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. Therefore, an 'organized crime' by nature of violent action indulged in by an individual singly or jointly either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of such syndicate should have been either with an object for making pecuniary gains or undue economic or other advantage or for promoting insurgency. If the object was for making pecuniary gains it can be either for himself or for any other person. But we notice for promoting insurgency, there is no such requirement of any personal interest or the interest of any other person or body. The mere indulgence in a violent activity etc. either for pecuniary gain or other advantage or for promoting insurgency as an individual, either singly or jointly as a member of 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of a such syndicate would be sufficient for bringing the said activity within the four corners of the definition of 'organized crime'.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: An 'organized crime syndicate' is a group of two or more persons who by acting singly or collectively as a syndicate or gang indulge in activities of 'organized crime'.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: By conspectus reading of the above three definitions, if in the preceding 10 years from the date of third continuing unlawful activity if more than one charge-sheet has been filed before a competent Court which had taken cognizance of such offence which would result in imposition of a punishment of three years or more, undertaken by a person individually or jointly either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on its behalf, such crime if falls within the definition of 'organized crime', the invocation of MCOCA would be the resultant position.\n",
      "Paragraph 97: Keeping the above broad prescription as the outcome of the definition of Section 2(1)(d)(e)&(f) in mind, when we refer to Section 3, we find that it is a penal provision under which, the various punishments for the commission of 'organized crime' have been set out and such punishment can be up to life imprisonment and even death, apart from fine subject to minimum of Rupees one lakh to maximum of Rupees five lakhs. The imprisonment ranges from five years to life imprisonment and can also result in imposition of death penalty. Section 17 prescribes Special Rules of evidence notwithstanding anything contrary contained in Cr.P.C. or the Indian Evidence Act for the purposes of trial and punishment for offences under MCOCA. Section 18 of the Act is again a non-obstante clause which states that irrespective of any provision in the Code or in the Indian Evidence Act, and subject to the provisions of said Section, a confession made by a person before a police officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police and recorded by such police officer either in writing or in any mechanical devices like cassettes, tapes or sound tracks from which sounds or images can be reproduced shall be admissible in the trial of such person or co-accused abettor or conspirator provided they are charged and tried in the same case together with the accused. Section 20 is yet another provision under MCOCA which prescribes that where a person is convicted of any of the offence punishable under MCOCA, the Special Court may in addition to awarding any punishment, by order in writing declare that any property, movable or immovable or both, belonging to the accused and specified in the order shall stand forfeited to the State Government free from all encumbrances etc. Under Section 21, which again is a non- obstante clause, the provisions of the Act notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or any other law shall be deemed to be a cognizable offence within the meaning of clause (c) of Section 2 of the Code and \"cognizable case\" as defined in that clause should be constructed accordingly.\n",
      "Paragraph 98: Under Section 21(4) notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, no person accused of an offence punishable under MCOCA, when he is in custody, should be released on bail on his own bond unless under sub-clause (b) of sub-section (4) even when the Public Prosecutor opposes the application for bail, the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the said accused is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.\n",
      "Paragraph 99: Under Section 22 there is a rebuttable presumption of commission of organized crime punishable under Section 3 unless the contrary is proved.\n",
      "Paragraph 100: Under Section 23 a safeguard is provided to the effect that under Section 23(1)(a) no information about the commission of an offence of organized crime under MCOCA should be recorded by a police officer without the prior approval of a police officer not below the rank of Deputy Inspector General of Police. Further under Section 23(1)(b) no investigation of an offence under MCOCA shall be carried out by a police officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police. Under sub-Section (2) of Section 23, no Special Court should take cognizance of any offence under MCOCA without the previous sanction of the police officer not below the rank of Additional Director General of Police.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: Reference to the above provisions thus discloses that the Act is very stringent in its operation when it comes to the question of dealing with an 'organized crime' committed by an 'organized crime syndicate' in respect of a 'continuing unlawful activity'. With the above salient features of the provisions of MCOCA in mind, when we consider the various submissions of the learned counsel, the main submissions of the learned counsel for the appellants were five-fold.\n",
      "Paragraph 102: The first submission was that the present appellants were all alleged to have been involved in a bomb blast which occurred on 29.09.2008 at a place called 'Malegaon'. According to the prosecuting agency, the appellants were either member of an organization called 'Abhinav Bharat' which was registered in the year 2007 or the commission of the offence was jointly with the members of the said organization for and on its behalf. The contention in the foremost was that in order to rope in the appellants on the above footing, the requirement of Section 2(1)(d), namely, 'continuing unlawful activity' must have been satisfied. In order to demonstrate such compliance, it was contended on behalf of the prosecuting agency that there were two earlier occurrences of bomb blasts one in Parbhani on 21.11.2003 and another at Jalna on 27.08.2004, that on those two earlier occurrences A- 7, namely, Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade was involved who is also a member of the present gang and consequently the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' is satisfied.\n",
      "Paragraph 103: The learned counsel for the appellants on the other hand contended that A-7 was not a member of the so-called 'Abhinav Bharat', that 'Abhinav Bharat' as an organization was not indisputably involved in the two earlier occurrences in the year 2003 and 2004, therefore, when such clear demarcation existed as between the appellants, the so-called members of Abhinav Bharat and the earlier occurrences of 2003 and 2004, as well as, the exclusion of A-7 as member of 'Abhinav Bharat' there was no scope to invoke MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: We are, in the first instance, concerned with the appellant's challenge to the order of the Division Bench dated 19.07.2010 wherein the sole question considered pertains to the application of MCOCA based on the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' under Section 2(1)(d) for the purpose of grant of bail under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA. To recapitulate the background of this litigation, it was the order of discharge passed by the Special Judge in Special Case No.1 of 2009 dated 31.07.2009 on the footing that cognizance of two earlier cases within preceding 10 years from the date of third occurrence dated 29.09.2008 was not satisfied and based on the said conclusion the Special Judge passed the order of discharge and also simultaneously passed an order under Section 11 for the transfer of the Special Case No.1 of 2009 to the Regular Court which went before the Division Bench at the instance of the State and the prosecuting agency.\n",
      "Paragraph 105: The Division Bench while dealing with the said conclusion of the Special Court took a contrary view holding that the Special Judge misdirected himself by stating that the cognizance was with reference to the offender and not the offence which led to the passing of such an illegal order dated 31.07.2009. The Division Bench took the view that going by the provisions contained in Section 2(1)(d) read along with Sections 190 and 173(3) of the Cr.P.C., as well as the settled principles in the various decisions of this Court, the cognizance of offence was taken as early as on 07.09.2006 in the Parbhani case and 30.09.2006 in the Jalna case, which were within the preceding 10 years from the date of the occurrence of Malegaon case, namely, 29.09.2008 and therefore, the order of discharge passed by the Special Judge was not sustainable and valid in law.\n",
      "Paragraph 106: Having recapitulated the background to the above extent when we examine the contentions raised, it must be stated that the conclusion of the Division Bench as regards the cognizance aspect cannot be held to be totally erroneous when it struck down the order of the Special Judge dated 31.07.2009. Keeping aside for the present the various other submissions and considering the opening submission of the counsel while assailing the order of Division Bench wherein we confine to the question relating to taking cognizance of the offence as set out apparently in Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA. In that perception, on the opening submission of the learned counsel for the appellants we too have no hesitation to hold that the cognizance of the offence as stated to have been rightly taken into account in respect of Parbhani and Jalna based on the charge-sheets dated 07.09.2006 and 30.09.2006 respectively was perfectly in order to apply the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' for the purpose of invoking MCOCA with reference to Malegaon occurrence. We, however, wish to examine in detail the justification for our above conclusion when we deal with the other contentions where submissions were made in extenso with particular reference to the involvement of A-7 in the alleged occurrences of Parbhani and Jalna, more particularly with reference to the date of supplementary charge-sheet, arrest made and the arrest made with reference to Malegaon occurrence and the alleged nexus as between the appellants and A-7 in order to find out whether application of MCOCA could still be held to be validly made by the prosecuting agency. For the present by reaching our conclusion as above on the first submission, we proceed to deal with the next submission of learned counsel for the appellants.\n",
      "Paragraph 107: The submission of the learned counsel for the appellants was that under Section 2(1)(d), in order to construe a 'continuing unlawful activity' two earlier charge-sheets in the preceding 10 years should exist and that such charge-sheets should have been taken cognizance by the competent court within the said period of 10 years and it must have been accomplished. It was also contended that for ascertaining the said position, the date of the third occurrence should be the relevant date for counting the preceding 10 years. Insofar as that claim is concerned, it can be straight away accepted that since Section 2(1)(d) uses the expression 'an activity' in the very opening set of expressions, which is prohibited by law, the date of such activity, namely, the third one can be taken as the relevant date for the purpose of finding out the two earlier charge-sheets in the preceding 10 years, in which event in the present case, the preceding 10 years will have to be counted from 29.09.2008 which was the date when the third occurrence of Malegaon bomb blast took place.\n",
      "Paragraph 108: With reference to Malegaon bomb blast, A-7 is the key person to be noted as it was with reference to his involvement in the earlier two bomb blast cases, namely, Parbhani and Jalna the whole case of the prosecution for invoking MCOCA was developed. Even while examining the various other submissions, we want to once again reiterate that our present endeavour is for examining the correctness of the order of the Division Bench which stems from the first order of the Special Judge dated 31.07.2009 by which the appellants were discharged and the consequential order under Section 11 transferring the case to the Regular Court. It must also be stated that our endeavour in this respect is also for the purpose of finding an answer to the prescription contained in Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 109: Therefore, what all to be examined is whether cognizance of the earlier two offences as mentioned in the definition of Section 2(1)(d) was duly taken within the preceding period of 10 years. Having stated in uncontroverted terms that 29.09.2008 is the relevant date, namely the date of third occurrence (i.e.) Malegaon bomb blast, when we go back, the question is whether in respect of the bomb blast in Parbhani on 21.11.2003 and similar bomb blast in Jalna on 27.08.2004 the charge-sheets were filed and cognizance was taken by the competent court within the said period of preceding 10 years. There is no controversy as to the date of occurrence of the above two bomb blasts. There is also no dispute that the very first charge-sheet in Parbhani as against A-1 was filed on 07.09.2006 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate. Similarly, the filing of the first charge-sheet on 30.09.2006 in Jalna case is also not in dispute. The contention put forward is that the supplementary charge-sheet in respect of A-7 in Parbhani case was filed only on 13.11.2008 and on 15.11.2008 in Jalna case and if those two dates with regard to A-7 are taken as the relevant dates, then the requirement of two earlier cases as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) preceding 10 years period was not satisfied, inasmuch as, the date of third occurrence was 29.09.2008 and the date of charge-sheets as against the A-7 were subsequent to that date and not earlier. The said crucial factor is required to be determined to decide the contention raised on behalf of the appellants. In this context reliance was placed upon the decisions in Ajit Kumar Palit (supra) and Dilawar Singh (supra) on behalf of the appellants. That apart, reference was also made to Section 173(2)(i)(a) and 173(8) to contend that cognizance referred to in context of MCOCA would only relate to the offender and not to the offence as prescribed under Section 190(1)(b).\n",
      "Paragraph 110: As against the above submissions Mr. Anil Singh, learned ASG appearing for respondent-State and Mr. Mariarputham, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Maharashtra and NIA contended that the relevant dates are the first charge-sheet filed in Parbhani case on 07.09.2006 and in Jalna case on 30.09.2006. Reliance was placed upon the decisions in R.R. Chari (supra), Raghbans Dubey (supra), Darshan Singh Ram Kishan (supra), Salap Service Station (supra), CREF Finance Limited (supra), Pastor P. Raju (supra), Videocon International Ltd. (supra) and Fakhruddin Ahmad (supra) in support of the submission. Reliance was also placed upon Section 190 Cr.P.C. to contend that cognizance of offence is relevant and not the offender and, therefore, the initial date of cognizance taken by the Chief Judicial Magistrate on the above dates in respect of Parbhani and Jalna will hold good for invoking MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: It was also contended that cognizance is an act which a Court when first apply its judicial mind with a view to proceed with the matter and, therefore, when in Parbhani and Jalna by virtue of Section 190 read along with Section 173 based on the report of the police when the first charge- sheet was filed on 07.09.2006 and 30.09.2006 respectively in Parbhani and Jalna, the requirement of taking cognizance by the Competent Court in respect of offences under the Indian Penal Code which alone was relevant in respect of the two earlier cases was satisfied and nothing more was required to be shown. Further reliance was placed upon R.R. Chari (supra), Darshan Singh Ram Kishan (supra), Mohd. Khalid (supra), Mona Panwar (supra) and Sarah Mathew (supra) in support of the above submissions.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: Keeping the respective submissions of the learned counsel in mind when we examine the said issue, in the first instance we wish to refer to relevant provisions touching upon this issue, namely, Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA and Section 173(2) and (8) as well as Sections 190 and 193 of Criminal Procedure Code. When we refer to Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' is defined to mean an activity prohibited by law and that it should be a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment of three years or more. For the purpose of ascertaining the issue relating to cognizance, the other part of the said definition which requires to be noted is that more than one charge-sheet should have been filed before a Competent Court within the preceding period of 10 years and that Court should have taken cognizance of such offence. The offence should alleged to have been committed either singly or jointly as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on its behalf. In so far as the offences are concerned, if the offence would attract a punishment of three years or more that would suffice for falling within the said definition. The charge-sheet should have been filed before a Competent Court with reference to such offence against the offenders.\n",
      "Paragraph 113: One of the contentions raised and which was countered by the respondents was that such two earlier offences should also satisfy the other requirements stipulated under MCOCA, namely, as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on behalf of an organized crime syndicate either singly or jointly. A strict interpretation of Section 2(1)(d) would definitely mean the fulfillment of such requirement since the definition specifically reads to the effect 'undertaken either singly or jointly as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate'. Therefore, even if the earlier offences were not initiated under the provisions of MCOCA such initiations should have been capable of being brought within the provisions of MCOCA, namely, as part of an activity of an organized crime syndicate either by its own members either singly or jointly or though not as a member but such participation should have been on behalf of an 'organized crime syndicate'. As far as filing of the charge-sheet is concerned what all it refers to is such filing before a Competent Court and that Court should have taken cognizance of such offence.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: A minute reference to the said Section, therefore, shows that in the event of the fulfillment of the rest of the requirements, namely, the nature of offence providing for punishment of three years and more, the involvement of the offender as required under the said definition, when it comes to the question of filing of the charge-sheet, the requirement of such filing should be before a competent court within a period preceding 10 years and that such court has taken cognizance of such offence. Significantly, when it comes to the question of fulfillment of the requirement of cognizance what is prescribed is the cognizance of such offence and not the offender.\n",
      "Paragraph 115: As far as the court is concerned, here again the specific reference used is 'competent court' and not 'Sessions Court'. Therefore, keeping aside the rest of the requirements to be fulfilled under Section 2(1)(d) for the present, when we consider the requirement of filing of the charge-sheet before the Competent Court and such Court taking cognizance of such offence, it can be stated without any scope of controversy that two earlier cases which would attract a punishment of more than three years and prohibited by law, undertaken singly or jointly as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on its behalf, if more than one charge-sheet is filed in respect of such offence before the Competent Court and the said Court had taken cognizance of such offence, the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\" would be satisfied.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: Keeping the said prescription of the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\" under Section 2(1)(d) in mind when we examine the question as to taking of cognizance and the Competent Court before whom more than one charge- sheet to be filed, there is no other provision under MCOCA which deals with or prescribes any stipulation for fulfillment of the said requirement. We have to, therefore, necessarily fall back upon the provisions contained in the Criminal Procedure Code. For that purpose reference to Sections 173, 190 and 193 have to be noted. Under Section 173(2)(i), it is stipulated that as soon as the investigation is completed, the officer in-charge of the Police Station should forward to the Magistrate who is empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report in the form prescribed by the State Government, which should contain among other things the names of the parties, the nature of information, the names of the persons who appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case and various other details.\n",
      "Paragraph 117: When we read the said Section 173(2)(i) along with Section 190 of Cr.P.C., it can be seen that any Magistrate of the first class or any Magistrate of the second class specially empowered as provided under sub-section (2) of the said Section may take cognizance of any offence upon a police report of such facts. Therefore, reading Section 173(2)(i) along with Section 190(1)(b), a duty is cast upon the officer in-charge of the police station mandatorily to forward to the Magistrate who is empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report. Under Section 190(1)(b) any Magistrate of the first class and for that matter any Magistrate of second class who is empowered by the Chief Judicial Magistrate for taking cognizance under sub-Section (1) can take cognizance of any offence based on filing of a police report furnished with the facts as stipulated under Section 173(2)(i) (a to h). A conjoint reading of Section 173(2)(i) and Section 190(1)(b), therefore, makes the position crystal clear that taking of cognizance of any offence by a Magistrate of the First Class or the Second Class subject to empowerment created under sub- Section (2) of Section 190 can take cognizance upon a police report. It can be emphasized here that under Section 190 (1) (b) where the Police Report as stated in Section 173(2) (i) is filed before a Magistrate under Section 190(1) (b), irrespective of the nature of offence, the said Magistrate has been invested with all the powers to take cognizance by applying his judicial mind. To be more precise, once the Police Report is filed before a judicial Magistrate as prescribed under Section 190(1) (b), who has been invested with the judicial authority to take cognizance of any offence in the first instance, the requirement of taking cognizance gets fulfilled at that very moment. Further the very fact that proceedings pertaining to Parbhani and Jalna were pending before the Magistrate where such proceedings were initiated by the filing of the police report till the occurrence in Malegaon took place itself was sufficient to demonstrate that judicial mind was very much applied to the proceedings based on the police report consequent upon cognizance taken.\n",
      "Paragraph 118: Keeping the said prescription of law in mind, when we apply the requirement as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA, without straining any further on this question, it can be safely held that the requirement of filing of the charge-sheet in two earlier cases before the competent court in respect of an offence stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) can be held to be satisfied once cognizance is taken by a Judicial Magistrate of first class or for that matter an empowered second class Magistrate, in the event of filing of a police report as prescribed under Section 173(2)(i) by virtue of the power vested under Section 190(1)(b) of Cr.P.C. If the ingredients of the above requirements are fulfilled it will have to be held, that that part of the requirement under Section 2(1)(d), namely, the competent court taking cognizance of the offence as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) in respect of two earlier cases will get fulfilled.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: Once we steer clear of the said legal position, to emphasize further, we also wish to refer to Section 193 Cr.P.C. the caption of which specifically states \"Cognizance of offences by Courts of Session\". The said Section is negatively couched and states that except as otherwise expressly provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, no Court of Session shall take cognizance of any offence as a Court of Original Jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under this Code. For our purpose of ascertaining the requirement of competent court and cognizance stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA, we find that under Section 193, the Court of Session can take hold of the case as a Court of Original Jurisdiction only after committal order is passed to it by a Magistrate under the provisions of Cr.P.C., whereas under Section 190(1)(b), the power of a Magistrate has been pithily stated to mean that he can take cognizance of any offence subject to the fulfillment of the requirements (a), (b) and (c) and no further.\n",
      "Paragraph 120: We are now pitted with the question as to whether the taking of cognizance of the offence by the Competent Court under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA is referable only to the Court of Sessions or even to a Magistrate of first class under Section 190. In this context, when we read Section 2(1)(d) along with 190 and 193 in the absence of any specific stipulation either under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA or any other provision under the said Act in the ordinary course of interpretation it can be validly stated that on fulfillment of Section 190, when a Judicial Magistrate of first class or an empowered second class Magistrate, takes cognizance of any offence that would fulfill the requirement of Section 2(1)(d) relating to competent court. We have noted under MCOCA that beyond what has been stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) there is no other provision dealing with the matter relating to a Competent Court for the purpose of taking cognizance. When under the provisions of Cr.P.C., Judicial Magistrate of first class has been empowered to take cognizance of any offence based on a Police Report, we fail to see any hurdle to state that on taking cognizance in that manner, the said court should be held to be the competent court for satisfying the requirement of Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA. In this respect, we will have to bear in mind that the implication of MCOCA would come into play only after the third occurrence takes place and only after that it will have to be seen whether on the earlier two such occasions involvement of someone jointly or singly, either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on its behalf indulged in a crime in respect of which a charge- sheet has already been filed before the Competent Court which Court had taken cognizance of such offence.\n",
      "Paragraph 121: Therefore, we are able to state the legal position without any ambiguity to the effect that in the event of a Judicial first class Magistrate or an empowered second class Magistrate having taken cognizance of an offence based on a police report as stipulated under Section 173(2)(i), such cognizance of an offence would fulfill the requirement of that part of the definition under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA. Once we are able to ascertain the said legal position by way of strict interpretation, without any ambiguity, we also wish to refer to various decisions relied upon by either party to note whether there is any scope of contradiction with reference to said legal position.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: Mr. Lalit, learned counsel in the course of his submissions relied upon [?CITATION?] and another \\- [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] In the said decision with reference to the expression 'cognizance' a three- Judge Bench of this Court has explained what is really meant by the said expression in the following words in paragraph 19:\n",
      "Paragraph 123: \"......The word \"cognizance\" has no esoteric or mystic significance in criminal law or procedure. It merely means-become aware of and when used with reference to a court or Judge, to take notice of judicially. It was stated in [?CITATION?] by the learned Judges of the Patna High Court in a passage quoted with approval by this Court in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] that the word \"cognizance\" was used in the Code to indicate the point when the Magistrate or Judge takes judicial notice of an offence and that it was a word of indefinite import, and is not perhaps always used in exactly the same sense. As observed in [?CITATION?] at page 416, \"taking cognizance does not involve any formal action; or indeed action of any kind, but occurs as soon as a Magistrate, as such, applies his mind to the suspected commission of an offence\". Where the statute proscribes the materials on which alone the judicial mind shall operate before any step is taken, obviously the statutory requirement must be fulfilled......\"\n",
      "Paragraph 124: (Emphasis added) In the above extracted portion the reference made to the earlier judgment in R.R. Chari's case reported in R.R. Chari (supra) at page 210 that the word 'cognizance' was used in the Court to indicate the point when the Magistrate or Judge takes judicial notice of an offence throws sufficient light to state that at that very moment when a Magistrate takes judicial notice of an offence, the requirement of cognizance of such offence will get fulfilled. Therefore, the said decision also fully supports our conclusion on the question of taking cognizance by the competent Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 125: Reliance was then placed upon the decision in Dilawar Singh (supra) in particular paragraph 8. The said paragraph 8 reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 126: \"8\\. The contention raised by learned counsel for the respondent that a court takes cognizance of an offence and not of an offender holds good when a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence under Section 190 CrPC. The observations made by this Court in Raghubans Dubey v. State of Bihar were also made in that context. The Prevention of Corruption Act is a special statute and as the preamble shows, this Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the prevention of corruption and for matters connected therewith. Here, the principle expressed in the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant would apply which means that if a special provision has been made on a certain matter, that matter is excluded from the general provisions. (See Godde Venkateswara Rao v. Govt. of A.P., State of Bihar v. Dr. Yogendra Singh and Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education v. Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth.) Therefore, the provisions of Section 19 of the Act will have an overriding effect over the general provisions contained in Section 190 or 319 CrPC. A Special Judge while trying an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, cannot summon another person and proceed against him in the purported exercise of power under Section 319 CrPC if no sanction has been granted by the appropriate authority for prosecution of such a person as the existence of a sanction is sine qua non for taking cognizance of the offence qua that person.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 127: (Emphasis added) By relying upon the said part of the decision it was contended that taking 'cognizance of an offence' cannot be the universal rule and that under special circumstances such cognizance of offence would be qua that person, namely, the offender. It is true that in the said decision while dealing with the requirement of sanction under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act with reference to an offence under Section 13(2) of the said Act, this Court did say that in the absence of a sanction under Section 19 the taking of cognizance of the offence qua that person cannot be held to have been made out. When we apply the said decision, it must be stated that it was laid in the context of an offence under Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act which Act specifically stipulates the requirement of prior sanction under Section 19 for proceeding against a public servant by way of a sanction and, therefore, it was held that Section 19 of the Act will have an overriding effect over the general provisions contained in Section 190 or 319 of Cr.P.C. For the fulfillment of the requirement to be complied with under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA, for ascertaining a 'continuing unlawful activity' in the absence of any such restriction as stipulated under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act under the provisions of MCOCA we have found that Section 190 will have every effect insofar as taking of cognizance by a competent Court is concerned as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) and, therefore, as held by us on compliance of the said requirement under Section 190, namely, cognizance of the offence by the competent Magistrate, that part of the requirement under Section 2(1)(d) will get automatically fulfilled.\n",
      "Paragraph 128: Reliance was then placed upon the decision in Fakhruddin Ahmad (supra), in particular paragraph 17. The said paragraph 17 reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 129: \"17\\. Nevertheless, it is well settled that before a Magistrate can be said to have taken cognizance of an offence, it is imperative that he must have taken notice of the accusations and applied his mind to the allegations made in the complaint or in the police report or the information received from a source other than a police report, as the case may be, and the material filed therewith. It needs little emphasis that it is only when the Magistrate applies his mind and is satisfied that the allegations, if proved, would constitute an offence and decides to initiate proceedings against the alleged offender, that it can be positively stated that he has taken cognizance of the offence. Cognizance is in regard to the offence and not the offender.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 130: (emphasis added) Even here this Court has stated in uncontroverted terms that once the Magistrate applies his mind to the offence alleged and decides to initiate proceedings against the alleged offender, it can be stated that he has taken cognizance of the offence and by way of reiteration. It is further stated that cognizance is in regard to the offence and not the offender.\n",
      "Paragraph 131: This decision, therefore, reinforces the position that cognizance is mainly of the offence and not the offender.\n",
      "Paragraph 132: In R.R. Chari (supra), in paragraph 8, this Court made it clear that the word 'cognizance' is used by the Court to indicate the point when the Magistrate or a Judge first takes judicial notice of an offence. Therefore, primarily cognizance of an offence takes place when a Judicial Magistrate applies his mind and takes judicial notice of the offence. In fact that is what has been even statutorily stipulated under Section 190(1) of Cr.P.C.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: In Darshan Singh Ram Kishan (supra), in paragraph 8, with particular reference to Section 190, this Court has held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 134: \"8\\. As provided by Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a Magistrate may take cognizance of an offence either, (a) upon receiving a complaint, or (b) upon a police report, or (c) upon information received from a person other than a police officer or even upon his own information or suspicion that such an offence has been committed. As has often been held, taking cognizance does not involve any formal action or indeed action of any kind but occurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind to the suspected commission of an offence. Cognizance, therefore, takes place at a point when a Magistrate first takes judicial notice of an offence. This is the position whether the Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence on a complaint, or on a police report, or upon information of a person other than a police officer. Therefore, when a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence upon a police report, prima facie he does so of the offence or offences disclosed in such report.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 135: (emphasis added) The above passage referred to in the said decision makes the position explicitly clear that cognizance would take place at a point when a Magistrate first takes judicial notice of the offence either on a complaint or on a police report or upon information of a person other than the police officer. Taking judicial notice is nothing but pursuing the report of the police officer, proceeding further on that report by opening the file and thereafter taking further steps to ensure the presence of the accused and all other consequential steps including at a later stage depending upon the nature of offence alleged to pass necessary order of committal to Court of Sessions.\n",
      "Paragraph 136: In Salap Service Station (supra), the question as to what is the implication of a supplementary report filed by the investigating agency under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. was considered. While dealing with the same, it has been stated as under in paragraph 2:\n",
      "Paragraph 137: 2.....It may be mentioned here that in the supplementary charge-sheet allegations are to the effect that there was violation of Direction 12 of the Control Order. The question of taking cognizance does not arise at this stage since cognizance has already been taken on the basis of the main charge-sheet. What all Section 173(8) lays down is that the investigating agency can carry on further investigation in respect of the offence after a report under sub- section (2) has been filed. The further investigation may also disclose some fresh offences but connected with the transaction which is the subject-matter of the earlier report..............The purpose of sub- section (8) of Section 173 CrPC is to enable the investigating agency to gather further evidence and that cannot be frustrated. If the materials incorporated in the supplementary charge-sheet do not make out any offence, the question of framing any other charge on the basis of that may not arise but in case the court frames a charge it is open to the accused persons to seek discharge in respect of that offence also as they have done already in respect of the offence disclosed in the main charge-sheet. The rejection of the report outright at that stage in our view is not correct.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 138: (emphasis added) The above statement of law with particular reference to Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. makes the position much more clear to the effect that the filing of the supplementary charge-sheet does not and will not amount to taking cognizance by the Court afresh against whomsoever again with reference to the very same offence. What all it states is that by virtue of the supplementary charge-sheet further offence may also be alleged and charge to that effect may be filed. In fact, going by Section 173(8) it can be stated like in our case by way of supplementary charge-sheet some more accused may also be added to the offence with reference to which cognizance is already taken by the Judicial Magistrate. While cognizance is already taken of the main offence against the accused already arrayed, the supplementary charge- sheet may provide scope for taking cognizance of additional charges or against more accused with reference to the offence already taken cognizance of and the only scope would be for the added offender to seek for discharge after the filing of the supplementary charge- sheet against the said offender.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: In CREF Finance Limited (supra) paragraph 10 is relevant wherein this Court has held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 140: 10......Cognizance is taken of the offence and not of the offender and, therefore, once the court on perusal of the complaint is satisfied that the complaint discloses the commission of an offence and there is no reason to reject the complaint at that stage, and proceeds further in the matter, it must be held to have taken cognizance of the offence. One should not confuse taking of cognizance with issuance of process. Cognizance is taken at the initial stage when the Magistrate peruses the complaint with a view to ascertain whether the commission of any offence is disclosed......\"\n",
      "Paragraph 141: (emphasis added) The said statement of law reinforces the legal position that cognizance is always of the offence and not the offender and once the Magistrate applies his judicial mind with reference to the commission of an offence the cognizance is taken at that very moment.\n",
      "Paragraph 142: To the very same effect is the judgment in Pastor P. Raju (supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 143: Paragraph 13 is relevant for our purpose, which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 144: \"13\\. It is necessary to mention here that taking cognizance of an offence is not the same thing as issuance of process. Cognizance is taken at the initial stage when the Magistrate applies his judicial mind to the facts mentioned in a complaint or to a police report or upon information received from any other person that an offence has been committed. The issuance of process is at a subsequent stage when after considering the material placed before it the court decides to proceed against the offenders against whom a prima facie case is made out.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 145: (emphasis added) The above principle has been reiterated again in Videocon International Ltd. (supra) in paragraph 19. Paragraph 19 can be usefully extracted, which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 146: \"19\\. The expression \"cognizance\" has not been defined in the Code. But the word (cognizance) is of indefinite import. It has no esoteric or mystic significance in criminal law. It merely means \"become aware of\" and when used with reference to a court or a Judge, it connotes \"to take notice of judicially\". It indicates the point when a court or a Magistrate takes judicial notice of an offence with a view to initiating proceedings in respect of such offence said to have been committed by someone.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 147: (emphasis added) In Mona Panwar (supra) at paragraph 19 what is meant by 'taking cognizance' has been explained as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 148: \"19\\. The phrase \"taking cognizance of\" means cognizance of an offence and not of the offender. Taking cognizance does not involve any formal action or indeed action of any kind but occurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind to the suspected commission of an offence. Cognizance, therefore, takes place at a point when a Magistrate first takes judicial notice of an offence. This is the position whether the Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence on a complaint or on a police report or upon information of a person other than a police officer. Before the Magistrate can be said to have taken cognizance of an offence under Section 190(1)(b) of the Code, he must have not only applied his mind to the contents of the complaint presented before him, but must have done so for the purpose of proceeding under Section 200 and the provisions following that section. However, when the Magistrate had applied his mind only for ordering an investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code or issued a warrant for the purposes of investigation, he cannot be said to have taken cognizance of an offence.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 149: (emphasis added) The above statement of law makes the position amply clear that cognizance is of an offence and not of the offender, that it does not involve any formal action and as soon as the Magistrate applies his judicial mind to the suspected commission of offence, cognizance takes place.\n",
      "Paragraph 150: Again in a recent decision of this Court in Sarah Mathew (supra) in paragraph 34, the position has been reiterated as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 151: \"34\\. Thus, a Magistrate takes cognizance when he applies his mind or takes judicial notice of an offence with a view to initiating proceedings in respect of offence which is said to have been committed. This is the special connotation acquired by the term \"cognizance\" and it has to be given the same meaning wherever it appears in Chapter XXXVI. It bears repetition to state that taking cognizance is entirely an act of the Magistrate. Taking cognizance may be delayed because of several reasons. It may be delayed because of systemic reasons. It may be delayed because of the Magistrate's personal reasons.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 152: Therefore, having regard to the overwhelming decisions of this Court in having repeatedly expressed what is meant by cognizance and in majority of the decisions by making specific reference to Section 190, we are clear that the interpretation has to be to the cognizance of the offence to be taken note of by the Judicial Magistrate as prescribed under Section 190 and if it takes place that would satisfy and fulfill the requirement of cognizance of offence by the filing of more than one charge-sheet before the Competent Court as stipulated in Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 153: Having considered the scope of the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\" as defined under Section 2(1)(d) with reference to the competent court and the cognizance of more than one earlier case, when we apply the said principles to the facts of this case, as noted in the initial part of this judgment, the two earlier cases were the bomb blast in Parbhani and Jalna. In Parbhani, the occurrence was on 21.11.2003 and in Jalna it was on 27.08.2004. In the Parbhani case, the first charge-sheet was filed as early as on 07.09.2006 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate and in Jalna it was filed on 30.09.2006 before the concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate and in both the cases, cognizance was taken and the proceedings before the respective Magistrates concerned were continued. Therefore, having regard to our conclusion that the cognizance taken by the Judicial Magistrate under Section 190(1) of Cr.P.C. based on the police report under Section 173(2)(i) of Cr.P.C. the same would fulfill the requirement of 'cognizance' as well as, the 'competent court'. It will have to be, therefore, held that to that extent, the definition under Section 2(1)(d) relating to \"continuing unlawful activity\" in respect of more than one case of an offence punishable for more than three years is fully satisfied. Once we come to the said conclusion, we do not find any substance in the third submission of the appellants that cognizance by competent court would only mean cognizance of such offences which can be dealt with only by the Sessions Court and not by a Judicial Magistrate. Therefore, the said submission that the cognizance was taken by Sessions Court much later after its committal (i.e.) in the case of Parbhani only on 29.04.2009 that is after the bomb blast in Malegaon and thereby the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' in respect of more than one case under Section 2(1)(d) is not satisfied cannot be accepted. The said submission, therefore, deserves to be rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 154: The next submission made on behalf of the appellants was that in order to constitute the earlier two offences to fall within the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' for invoking the provisions of MCOCA after the third occurrence, the involvement of the accused must have been by the same gang. In other words, even if it were to be held that a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' singly or jointly participated or on behalf of an 'organized crime syndicate' with reference to such participation taken place, what is to be ensured is that in all the three cases the same gang, namely, the 'organized crime syndicate' must have been involved. Based on the said contention it was submitted that in the case on hand after A-7 was arrested on 02.11.2008 he was produced in Parbhani case on 11.11.2008 and supplementary charge-sheet was filed against him on 13.11.2008 and in Jalna case a supplementary charge-sheet was filed on 15.11.2008 while none of the other accused had any role to play either in Parbhani or in Jalna, nor was the so- called 'Abhinav Bharat' was involved in either Parbhani or Jalna occurrences. The contention was that though A-7 was implicated both in Parbhani and Jalna such implication was not in pursuance of his role as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' pertaining to Malegaon bomb blast nor was the position that the gang involved in Malegaon blast was also responsible for the bomb blast in Parbhani and Jalna. It is, therefore, contended that even as regards to A-7 he only alleged to have gathered certain materials and procured at the request of one Devle who was the prime accused in Parbhani and Jalna. It was contended that even as per the counter affidavit of the second respondent herein there was no nexus shown for the involvement of any of the accused in the Malegaon bomb blast case to do anything with Parbhani or Jalna bomb blast either individually or jointly as a member of gang or on behalf of the gang.\n",
      "Paragraph 155: In this context, reliance was placed upon the decision in Lalit Somdatta Nagpal & Anr. (supra). A similar contention was raised before this Court in that case to the effect that isolated incidents spread over a period of 10 years involving different types of offences would not attract the provisions of MCOCA and that such activity must be such as to have a link from the first to the last offence alleged to have been undertaken in an organized manner by an organized crime syndicate. The contention was that continuing unlawful activity would necessarily mean continuous engagement in unlawful activity where there would be a live link between all the different offences alleged. The said contention was refuted on behalf of the State in the said case by contending that no live link need exist between the different cases for the application of MCOCA and that such nexus theory was not contemplated by the legislature. While dealing with the said contention, this Court in the facts of that case held as under in paragraph 63:\n",
      "Paragraph 156: \"63\\. As has been repeatedly emphasised on behalf of all the parties, the offence under MCOCA must comprise continuing unlawful activity relating to organised crime undertaken by an individual singly or jointly, either as a member of the organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate by use of coercive or other unlawful means with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. In the instant case, both Lalit Somdatta Nagpal and Anil Somdatta Nagpal have been shown to have been involved in several cases of a similar nature which are pending trial or are under investigation. As far as Kapil Nagpal is concerned, his involvement has been shown only in respect of CR No. 25 of 2003 of Rasayani Police Station, Raigad, under Sections 468, 420 and 34 of the Penal Code and Sections 3, 7, 9 and 10 of the Essential Commodities Act. In our view, the facts as disclosed justified the application of the provisions of MCOCA to Lalit Nagpal and Anil Nagpal. However, the said ingredients are not available as far as Kapil Nagpal is concerned, since he has not been shown to be involved in any continuing unlawful activity. Furthermore, in the approval that was given by the Special Inspector General of Police, Kolhapur Range, granting approval to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Enforcement), Crime Branch, CID, Mumbai to commence investigation under Section 23(1) of MCOCA, Kapil Nagpal has not been mentioned. It is only at a later stage with the registering of CR No. 25 of 2003 of Rasayani Police Station, Raigad, that Kapil Nagpal was roped in with Lalit Nagpal and Somdatta Nagpal and permission was granted to apply the provisions of MCOCA to him as well by order dated 22-8-2005.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 157: (underlining is ours) When we refer to the said line of reasoning stated therein, we find that in the case of one accused, namely, one Kapil Nagpal, since he was not shown to be involved in any of the earlier cases, his case required to be dealt with differently and he cannot be said to have been involved in any continuing unlawful activity. We do not find any other specific reason for excluding him.\n",
      "Paragraph 158: In this context a three Judge Bench decision of this Court, which throws much light on this issue is Ranjitsing Brahamjeetsing Sharma (supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 159: Paragraphs 31, 36 and 37 are relevant for our purpose which read as under.\n",
      "Paragraph 160: \"31\\. The High Court does not say that the appellant has abetted Telgi or had conspired with him. The findings of the High Court as against the appellant are attributable to allegations of abetting Kamat and Mulani.\n",
      "Paragraph 161: Both Kamat and Mulani were public servants. They may or may not have any direct role to play as regards commission of an organised crime but unless a [pic]nexus with an accused who is a member of the organised crime syndicate or an offence in the nature of organised crime is established, only by showing some alleged indulgence to Kamat or Mulani, the appellant cannot be said to have conspired or abetted commission of an organised crime. Prima facie, therefore, we are of the view that Section 3(2) of MCOCA is not attracted in the instant case.\n",
      "Paragraph 162: 36\\. Does this statute require that before a person is released on bail, the court, albeit prima facie, must come to the conclusion that he is not guilty of such offence? Is it necessary for the court to record such a finding? Would there be any machinery available to the court to ascertain that once the accused is enlarged on bail, he would not commit any offence whatsoever?\n",
      "Paragraph 163: 37\\. Such findings are required to be recorded only for the purpose of arriving at an objective finding on the basis of materials on record only for grant of bail and for no other purpose.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 164: (emphasis added) A reading of paragraph 31 shows that in order to invoke MCOCA even if a person may or may not have any direct role to play as regards the commission of an organized crime, if a nexus either with an accused who is a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or with the offence in the nature of an 'organized crime' is established that would attract the invocation of Section 3(2) of MCOCA. Therefore, even if one may not have any direct role to play relating to the commission of an 'organized crime', but when the nexus of such person with an accused who is a member of the 'organized crime syndicate' or such nexus is related to the offence in the nature of 'organized crime' is established by showing his involvement with the accused or the offence in the nature of such 'organized crime', that by itself would attract the provisions of MCOCA. The said statement of law by this Court, therefore, makes the position clear as to in what circumstances MCOCA can be applied in respect of a person depending upon his involvement in an organized crime in the manner set out in the said paragraph. In paragraphs 36 and 37, it was made further clear that such an analysis to be made to ascertain the invocation of MCOCA against a person need not necessarily go to the extent for holding a person guilty of such offence and that even a finding to that extent need not be recorded. But such findings have to be necessarily recorded for the purpose of arriving at an objective finding on the basis of materials on record only for the limited purpose of grant of bail and not for any other purpose. Such a requirement is, therefore, imminent under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 165: Having regard to the said legal position with reference to the requirement to be fulfilled in respect of an 'organized crime' with particular reference to the past two instances and the present one in order to find out as to whether a person was involved in a 'continuing unlawful activity', when we refer to the facts before us, in the case on hand insofar as A-7 Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade is concerned, he has been charge- sheeted in Parbhani, Jalna as well as, the Malegaon bomb blast. The materials available on record disclose that he furnished certain materials at the asking of the prime accused involved in Parbhani and Jalna, which also related to bomb blasts in both the places. Going by the charge-sheet filed against A-7 in Malegaon his direct involvement has been alleged. A conspectus consideration of the above facts discloses that insofar as A-7 was concerned, he had a nexus with the member of an 'organized crime syndicate' and also had every nexus with the offence in the nature of an 'organized crime' of the two earlier cases, namely, Parbhani and Jalna and also direct involvement in the present bomb blast at Malegaon. In such circumstances, there is no difficulty in coming to a definite conclusion that insofar as, A-7 is concerned, his activity and involvement in all the three occurrences, namely, Parbhani, Jalna and Malegaon disclose nexus with the crime and also with the other accused involved in the crime and thereby the satisfaction of the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' of an 'organized crime' on behalf of an 'organized crime syndicate' is satisfactorily shown. In such circumstances, by virtue of Section 21 (4) of MCOCA he is not entitled for the grant of bail and that he does not fall within the excepted category stipulated in sub-clause (a) or (b) of the said sub-Section (4) of Section 21.\n",
      "Paragraph 166: Having stated the said position relating to A-7, when we come to the case of others, there is no dispute that in respect of other appellants, their involvement is with reference to the present occurrence, namely, Malegaon bomb blast. Admittedly they are not proceeded against for the offence relating to Parbhani and Jalna. But still at the present juncture, with the materials available on record as on date, we are not in a position to ascertain as to the involvement of the appellants either by way of their nexus with any accused who is a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or such nexus with the offence of an 'organized crime' which pertains to Parbhani and Jalna. We cannot also rule out the possibility of the evidence based on the investigation by the prosecuting agency to come out with reliable materials in support of such nexus to be shown with an accused or with the crime in respect of the earlier two cases, namely, Parbhani and Jalna. We cannot, therefore, declare to the extent as was done by the Special Judge in the order dated 31.07.2009 to straightway reach at a conclusion to the effect that MCOCA was not attracted and, therefore, they should be discharged.\n",
      "Paragraph 167: But, for the purpose of the requirement under Section 21(4) (b) having regard to the absence of any material as on date to disclose any nexus with the accused of an 'organized crime syndicate' or with the offence in the nature of an 'organized crime', in Parbhani and Jalna as of now we can state that in respect of appellants other than A-7 i.e. appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010, their application for bail can be considered by the Special Court. Therefore, on this issue, namely, in all cases same gang must be involved, our answer is to the above limited extent based on the earlier statement of law as declared in Ranjitsing Brahamjeetsing Sharma (supra) in paragraph 31.\n",
      "Paragraph 168: With that when we come to the next submission, namely, that in order to characterize the past occurrence as well as the present occurrence as an 'organized crime' falling under section 2 (1) (e) of MCOCA, in each of such occurrence, violence should have played a key role and that such violence etc. should have been for pecuniary gain. The submission was made on behalf of the appellants that there was no material to show that any of the appellants had any pecuniary advantage from anybody. The contention was that all the attributes of Section 2(1)(e), namely, an 'organized crime' must be present in all the three cases. It was further contended that in the occurrence relating to Parbhani and Jalna, there was no allegation of pecuniary advantage and they were all just mere cases of violence. It was, also contended that 'promoting insurgency' was also not the specific case of the prosecution in all the three cases, even assuming it may arise in Malegaon blast, the same was not present in Parbhani or Jalna.\n",
      "Paragraph 169: To appreciate the said contention, it will be necessary to make a detailed reference to Section 2(1)(e) of MCOCA. As far as the nature of activity is concerned, in Section 2(1)(e), it is stated that 'organized crime' means continuing unlawful activity by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means with the object of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. If we make a detailed reference to the said provision, the use of violence etc. should have been carried out with the object of either gaining pecuniary benefits or for gaining undue economic or other advantage for oneself or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. We find that the violent activity need not necessarily be for pecuniary advantage in all acts of 'continuing unlawful activity'. Indulging in such violent activity can be for gaining pecuniary advantage or for gaining any other undue economic or other advantage or for promoting insurgency. Therefore, at the very outset, we do not find any scope to interpret Section 2(1)(e), namely, an 'organized crime' to mean that in order to come within the said expression indulging in such violent or other activity should always be for pecuniary gain. On the other hand, we can safely hold that such indulgence in violent activity can be either for pecuniary gain or for economic advantage or for any other advantage either for the person who indulged in such activity or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. In that respect, we find that expected benefit for indulging in any violent or related activity could be for any of the above purposes independently and one such purpose may be for promoting insurgency.\n",
      "Paragraph 170: When once we are able to state the definition of 'organized crime' under Section 2(1) (e) with such clear precision, the other question is what is meant by 'promoting insurgency'. In fact, the said expression has already been considered by some of the judgments of this Court, and, therefore, we can make useful reference to those judgments to understand what is insurgency and whether there was any act of insurgency prevalent in the case on hand when the alleged activity of violence etc. alleged against the appellants. The dictionary meaning of expression 'insurgent' is raising an active revolt or a revolutionary. Therefore, going by the dictionary meaning, promoting insurgency would mean creating a revolution and thereby disturb the peaceful atmosphere. In fact, in the decision of this Court in Zameer Ahmad Latifur Rehman Sheikh (supra) a reference has been made to this very expression and has been dealt with in a detailed fashion in paragraphs 26 to 29. We can usefully refer to the said paragraphs to understand the expression insurgency. Paragraphs 26 to 29 are as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 171: \"26\\. The term \"insurgency\" has not been defined either under MCOCA or any other statute. The word \"insurgency\" does not find mention in UAPA even after the 2004 and 2008 Amendments. The definition as submitted by Mr Salve also does not directly or conclusively define the term \"insurgency\" and thus reliance cannot be placed upon it. The appellants would contend that the term refers to rising in active revolt or rebellion. Webster defines it as a condition of revolt against the Government that does not reach the proportion of an organised revolution.\n",
      "Paragraph 172: 27\\. In Sarbananda Sonowal v. Union of India this Court has held that insurgency is undoubtedly a serious form of internal disturbance which causes grave threat to the life of people, creates panic situation and also hampers the growth and economic prosperity of the State.\n",
      "Paragraph 173: 28\\. We feel inclined to adopt the aforesaid definition for the current proceedings as there does not appear to exist any other satisfactory source.\n",
      "Paragraph 174: 29\\. Although the term \"insurgency\" defies a precise definition, yet, it could be understood to mean and cover breakdown of peace and tranquility as also a grave disturbance of public order so as to endanger the security of the State and its sovereignty.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 175: [pic](Emphasis added) It has been more succinctly described in paragraphs 45 to 47 which can also be usefully referred to:\n",
      "Paragraph 176: \"45\\. Now that we have examined under what circumstances a State law can be said to be encroaching upon the law-making powers of the Central Government, we may proceed to evaluate the current issue on merits. Let us once again examine the provision at the core of this matter:\n",
      "Paragraph 177: \"2\\. (1)(e) 'organised crime' means any continuing unlawful activity by an individual, singly or jointly, either as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate, by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion, or other unlawful means, with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits, or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or any other person or promoting insurgency;\"\n",
      "Paragraph 178: After examining this provision at length, we have come to the conclusion that the definition of \"organised crime\" contained in Section 2(1)(e) of MCOCA makes it clear that the phrase \"promoting insurgency\" is used to denote a possible driving force for \"organised crime\". It is evident that MCOCA does not punish \"insurgency\" per se, but punishes those who are guilty of running a crime organisation, one of the motives of which may be the promotion of insurgency.\n",
      "Paragraph 179: 46\\. We may also examine the Statement of Objects and Reasons to support the conclusion arrived at by us. The relevant portion of the Statement of Objects and Reasons is extracted hereinbelow:\n",
      "Paragraph 180: \"1\\. Organised crime has for quite some years now come up as a very serious threat to our society. It knows no national boundaries and is fuelled by illegal wealth generated by contract, killing, extortion, smuggling in contrabands, illegal trade in narcotics, kidnappings for ransom, collection of protection money and money laundering, etc. The illegal wealth and black money generated by the organised crime being very huge, it has had serious adverse effect on our economy. It was seen that the organised criminal syndicates made a common cause with terrorist gangs and foster narcoterrorism which extends beyond the national boundaries. There was reason to believe that organised criminal gangs have been operating in the State and thus, there was immediate need to curb their activities.\n",
      "Paragraph 181: 2\\. The existing legal framework i.e. the penal and procedural laws and the adjudicatory system are found to be rather inadequate to curb or control the menace of organised crime. The Government has, therefore, decided to enact a special law with stringent and deterrent provisions including in certain circumstances power to intercept wire, electronic or oral communication to control the menace of organised crime.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 182: 47\\. We find no merit in the contention that MCOCA, in any way, deals with punishing insurgency directly. We are of the considered view that the legislation only deals with \"insurgency\" indirectly only to bolster the [pic]definition of \"organised crime\". However, even if it be assumed that \"insurgency\" has a larger role to play than pointed out by us above in MCOCA, we are of the considered view that the term \"promoting insurgency\"\n",
      "Paragraph 183: as contemplated under Section 2(1)(e) of MCOCA comes within the concept of public order.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 184: (Emphasis added) Therefore, 'insurgency' has been understood to mean raising an active revolt or rebellion in the common parlance. It is also stated that it could be understood to mean and cover breakdown of peace and tranquility as also a grave disturbance of public order so as to endanger the security of the State and its sovereignty. While making specific reference to Section 2(1)(e), it was pointed out that MCOCA though does not punish insurgency per se, punishes those who are guilty of running a crime organization and one of the motive of which may be the promotion of insurgency. Therefore, it is not necessary that promoting insurgency should always be linked to pecuniary advantage. Whenever an organized gang indulges in a violent act, such indulgence in violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means can be for promoting an insurgency.\n",
      "Paragraph 185: In the light of such line of thinking already expressed by this Court with particular reference to Section 2(1)(e), we do not find any different meaning to be attributed to the definition of 'organized crime', much less to the extent to which the appellants seek to interpret the said definition and state that the indulgence in any violent and related activity for promoting insurgency, the element of pecuniary advantage should be present.\n",
      "Paragraph 186: We, therefore, reject such a contention and hold that indulging in any violent or other related activity by an organized gang and thereby an effort to promote insurgency i.e. to damage the peace and tranquility in the State is made, that by itself would fall within the four corners of the definition of \"organized crime\" under Section 2(1)(e).\n",
      "Paragraph 187: In the light of our above conclusions on the various submissions, we are convinced that in respect of the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010, namely, A-7, there is no scope even for the limited purpose of Section 21(4)(b) to hold that application of MCOCA is doubtful. We have held that the said appellant A-7 had every nexus with all the three crimes, namely, Parbhani, Jalna and Malegaon and, therefore, the bar for grant of bail under Section 21 would clearly operate against him and there is no scope for granting any bail. Insofar as the rest of the appellants are concerned, for the purpose of invoking Section 21(4)(b), namely, to consider their claim for bail, it can be held that for the present juncture with the available materials on record, it is not possible to show any nexus of the appellants who have been proceeded against for their involvement in Malegaon blast with the two earlier cases, namely, Parbhani and Jalna. There is considerable doubt about their involvement in Parbhani and Jalna and, therefore, they are entitled for their bail applications to be considered on merits.\n",
      "Paragraph 188: When once we are able to steer clear of the said position, the other question to be considered is the grant of bail on its own merits. For which purpose, the submission of Mr. Mariarputham, learned senior counsel who appeared for the State of Maharashtra and NIA based on the decision relied upon by him in State of U.P. Through [?CITATION?] should be kept in mind, in particular paragraph 18, which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 189: \"18\\. It is well settled that the matters to be considered in an application for bail are (i) whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the offence; (ii) nature and gravity of the charge; (iii) severity of the punishment in the event of conviction;\n",
      "Paragraph 190: (iv) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing, if released on bail; (v) character, behaviour, means, position and standing of the accused; (vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated; (vii) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with; and (viii) danger, of course, of justice being thwarted by grant of bail [see [?CITATION?]]. While a vague allegation that the accused may tamper with the evidence or witnesses may not be a ground to refuse bail, if the accused is of such character that his mere presence at large would intimidate the witnesses or if there is material to show that he will use his liberty to subvert justice or tamper with the evidence, then bail will be refused. We may also refer to the following principles relating to grant or refusal of bail stated in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 191: 11\\. The law in regard to grant or refusal of bail is very well settled. The court granting bail should exercise its discretion in a judicious manner and not as a matter of course. Though at the stage of granting bail a detailed examination of evidence and elaborate documentation of the merit of the case need not be undertaken, there is a need to indicate in such orders reasons for prima facie concluding why bail was being granted particularly where the accused is charged of having committed a serious offence. Any order devoid of such reasons would suffer from non-application of mind. It is also necessary for the court granting bail to consider among other circumstances, the following factors also before granting bail; they are:\n",
      "Paragraph 192: (a) The nature of accusation and the severity of punishment in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 193: (b) Reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witness or apprehension of threat to the complainant.\n",
      "Paragraph 194: (c) Prima facie satisfaction of the court in support of the charge. (See Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh and Puran v. Rambilas.)\"\n",
      "Paragraph 195: Even the other contentions submitted by the learned senior counsel that the appellants are not entitled for bail, are all matters which the prosecuting agency will have to place before the Special Court for consideration while considering the appellants' application for bail. For the same reason, the various other contentions raised on behalf of the appellant in Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70/2010 as well as the appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8132 of 2010 by making reference to their personal grievances are all matters which will have to be placed before the Special Judge for consideration. We are not expressing any opinion on those aspects and we leave it for the Special Judge to consider the bail application on merits and pass appropriate orders.\n",
      "Paragraph 196: Accordingly, on question No.(a) in paragraph 35, we hold that the judgment of the Division Bench in holding that cognizance is of the offence and not of the offender is perfectly justified and the same does not call for any interference. Therefore, Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70 of 2010, Criminal Appeal No.1971 of 2010, Criminal Appeal Nos.1994-98 of 2010, appeal arising out of SLP(Crl) No.8132 of 2010 and Criminal Appeal No.58 of 2011 are dismissed. As far as the order dated 30.12.2010, rejecting bail, passed by the learned Special Judge, which was also confirmed by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court by order dated 09.11.2011 in Criminal Bail Application No.333 of 2011 with Criminal Application No.464 of 2011 of the appellant in appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos.9370-71 of 2011, the said orders are set aside with the observation that there is enough scope to doubt as to the application of MCOCA under Section 21(4)(b) for the purpose of grant of bail and consequently the Special Judge is directed to consider the application for bail on merits keeping in mind the observations in paragraphs 100 and 101 of this judgment and pass orders.\n",
      "Paragraph 197: Consequently, the appeals arising out of SLP(Crl.) Nos.9370-71 of 2011 are partly allowed. The order impugned in these appeals is set aside and the application for bail in Bail Application No.42 of 2008 is restored to the file of the Special Judge for passing orders on merits. Similarly, for the reasons stated in paragraph 99, we hold that the appellant in appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8132 of 2010 is also entitled for the same relief as is granted to the appellant for consideration for grant of bail in the appeals arising out of SLP(Crl.) Nos.9370-71 of 2011. We thus answer question No.(b) of paragraph 35 and the trial Court is, therefore, directed to apply the same principle and consider the bail application pending or filed afresh, if so advised, by the appellant in the appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8132 of 2010 and pass orders on merits. Consequently, Criminal Appeal No.1971 of 2010, Criminal Appeal Nos.1994-98 of 2010 and Criminal Appeal No.58 of 2011 are dismissed.\n",
      "Paragraph 198: Since the occurrence is of the year 2008 and nearly seven years have gone by, it is imperative that the Special Court commence the trial at the earliest and conclude the same expeditiously. We direct the Prosecuting Agency to ensure that the necessary evidence i.e. oral, documentary as well as other form of evidence placed before the Court to enable the Special Court to commence the trial early and conclude the same expeditiously. It is stated that no officer has been posted for the Special Court as on date.\n",
      "Paragraph 199: We, therefore, request the Chief Justice of the High Court of Bombay to pass appropriate orders either for posting these cases before a learned Judge by way of special order or appoint a Presiding Officer exclusively for deciding these cases in order to ensure speedy trial. We also direct the Presiding Officer of the Special Court to dispose of the bail applications expeditiously, preferably within one month from the date of his/her assumption of Office as Special Judge. The Registry is directed to transmit the records forthwith.\n",
      "Paragraph 200: Since, we have not heard arguments on the question as to the claim of NIA in seeking custody covered by SLP (Crl.) No.9303 of 2011 and SLP (Crl.) No.9369 of 2011 the same are delinked and shall be listed in due course.\n"

      "Paragraph 1: In all these appeals, identical question of law is involved and for the sake of brevity, we are discussing the question of law by taking note of the facts from Civil Appeal No. 2150 of 2012.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: The appellant/assessee herein, which is a public sector undertaking of the Government of India, has been selling iron and steel products, that are manufactured by it, to the Indian Railways. For this purpose, contract was signed between the said two parties and the goods were being sold to the Indian Railways at the price mutually agreed upon between them. On each removal of these goods for supply to the Railways, the assessee had been paying the excise duty as per the price disclosed by the assessee in the invoices issued at the time of the removal of the goods. Goods in this manner were supplied during the period January, 2005 to July, 2006 which period is involved in the instant appeal. It so happened that there was an upward revision in the price by the Railways in August, 2006 covering the period in question. On that basis, assessee was paid the price difference on the fixation of enhanced consideration for the goods supplied. The assessee paid the differential duty of Rs.142.78 crores voluntarily in August, 2006. According to the Revenue/respondent, since the differential duty was paid in August, 2006 and not paid at the time of clearance of the goods, there was delay in paying the differential duty and, therefore, under Section 11AB of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'), the assessee was liable to pay interest on the differential duty amount paid by it. The contention of the Revenue has been upheld by the Authorities below including Custom Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the 'Tribunal').\n",
      "Paragraph 3: The question, thus, that arises for consideration in these appeals is as to whether interest is leviable under Section 11AB of the Act on the differential duty amount paid under supplementary invoices due to price increase by virtue of price variation clause in the sale contract. Now, facts in some detail:\n",
      "Paragraph 4: The assessee is engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel products falling under Chapter 72 and 73 of the schedule of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. The final products manufactured includes rails.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: The final products manufactured by the assessee are cleared on payment of appropriate duty of excise leviable thereon. The final products are either directly sold at the factory gate or are transferred to various Branch Sales Offices from where they are sold to the customers. The sales either from the factory or from the BSOs are in terms of purchase orders received from the customers. The assessee sold the rails to the Indian Railways in terms of the Price Circular No. LP-06 of 2005 dated 24.02.2005 w.e.f. 01.07.2004.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: In terms of the prices quoted in the purchase orders, the assessee discharged central excise duty at the time of removal of the rails to the Indian Railways. Such price was the transaction value of the goods in terms of Section 4 of the Act at the given time. In terms of the price variation clause and also in terms of the agreement with the Indian Railways, the price circular dated 24.02.2005 effective from 01.07.2004 was revised upwards with increase in the agreed upon price. A revised price circular No. LP-010/06 dated 20.07.2006 was issued revising the agreed upon price.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: In terms of the revised price circular the assessee discharged differential duty of Rs.142,78,88,172/- on the rails cleared during the period from January, 2005 to July, 2006. The differential duty was paid in August, 2006 under intimation to the Departmental Authorities.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: In the above background, on a scrutiny of ER-1 return filed by the assessee for the month of August, 2006, a show cause notice dated 01.06.2007 was issued to the assessee contending that in respect of the differential duty of Rs.142.78 crores paid in August, 2006, the assessee are required to pay an interest of Rs.15,51,81,231/- under Section 11AB of the Act. The notice alleged that since the price was not correctly determined at the time of removal of goods there was short payment of duty hence the assessee is liable to pay interest. The notice also alleges that since the price was not final the duty should be treated as paid on the provisional price and in terms of Rule 7(4) of the Central Excise Rules interest under Section 11AB is payable. The notice also relied on circular dated 28.07.2003 to allege that the assessee is required to pay interest. The notice also proposed to impose penalty under Rule 25 for contravention of Rules 7 and 8 of the Rules.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: The assessee filed detailed reply dated 17.10.2007 challenging the allegations contained in the show cause ntoice and contending that no interest is payable on the differential duty paid on account of price variation.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: The Commissioner of Central Excise, Raipur passed order dated 31.10.2007 confirming the amount of interest proposed in the show cause notice and also imposing penalty of Rs.2,00,000/-. Against the order dated 31.10.2007 passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise, Raipur, assessee filed an appeal before the Tribunal. The Tribunal has passed the impugned order dated 13.08.2010 and dismissed the appeal. This order is challenged by way of instant appeal.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: It becomes manifest from the aforesaid facts that the assessee had discharged the excise duty on the goods cleared by it on the basis of invoices raised indicating the value of these goods and as on the date of the clearance of these goods. It cannot be disputed that the price declared in the said invoice was the transaction value of the goods in terms of Section 4 of the Act inasmuch as that was the price fixed between the parties at which the goods were to be supplied at the time and place of removal. The occasion for differential duty arose at a later date due to price variation clause in the contract for sale. The moment the assessee received the enhanced price due to price escalation, it paid differential duty on its own immediately on receipt of the said price.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: It is in this backdrop it is to be examined as to whether the difference in price, as per the decision taken by the Railways on a later date i.e. much after the date on which the goods were cleared, can be treated as price as on the date when the goods were actually removed and, therefore, it is to construed that the duty initially paid was 'short paid' to bring this event within the fold of Section 11AB of the Act. As per the assessee, provisions of Section 11AB of the Act would not be attracted at all inasmuch as, by no stretch of imagination, it can be treated that on the date of removal of the goods when the duty was paid as per the price fixed at that time, it is now to be treated as 'short paid' only because of the occurrence of an event at a later date which could not be visualised or taken into consideration at the time of removal of these goods.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: For proper understanding of the matter, we may reproduce provisions of Section 11AB of the Act at this stage, which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 14: (1) Where any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short- levied or short-paid or erroneously refunded, the person who is liable to pay the duty as determined under sub-section (2), or has paid the duty under sub- section (2B), of Section 11A, shall, in addition to the duty, be liable to pay interest at such rate not below eighteen percent and not exceeding thirty-six percent per annum, as is for the time being fixed by the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, from the first date of the month succeeding the month in which the duty ought to have been paid under this Act, or from the date of such erroneous refund, as the case may be, but for the provisions contained in sub-section (2), or sub-section (2B), of Section 11A till the date of payment of such duty:\n",
      "Paragraph 15: Provided that in such cases where the duty becomes payable consequent to issue of an order, instruction or direction by the Board under Section 37B, and such amount of duty payable is voluntarily paid in full, without reserving any right to appeal against such payment at any subsequent stage, within forty- five days from the date of issue of such order, instruction or direction, as the case may be, no interest shall be payable and in other cases the interest shall be payable on the whole of the amount, including the amount already paid.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: The provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply to cases where the duty had become payable or ought to have been paid before the date on which the Finance Bill, 2001 receives the assent of the President.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: Explanation 1. - Where the duty determined to be payable is reduced by the Commissioner (Appeals), the Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may be, the Court, the interest shall be payable on such reduced amount of duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Explanation 2. - Where the duty determined to be payable is increased or further increased by the Commissioner (Appeals), the Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may be, the Court, the interest shall be payable on such increased or further increased amount of duty. A bare reading of the aforesaid provision reflects that in order to attract the same, following requirements need to be fulfilled:\n",
      "Paragraph 19: (a) Non-levy or non-payment of duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: (b) Short levy or short payment of duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: (c) erroneous refund.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: (d) duty determined under Section 11A(2).\n",
      "Paragraph 23: (e) Section 11A(2) requiring Notice issued under Section 11A.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: (f) duty payment under Section 11A(2B).\n",
      "Paragraph 25: (g) interest is payable on such reduced or increased duty determined to be payable by Commissioner (Appeals) or Appellate Tribunal etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: Before proceeding further, we would like to point out that we are not treading on a virgin territory, inasmuch as the provisions of Section 11AB of the Act have already been interpreted by this Court in two judgments under almost similar circumstances. These are:\n",
      "Paragraph 27: (a) [?CITATION?] (b) [?CITATION?] In SKF India Ltd. case, the assessee was engaged in the manufacture and sale of ball bearings and textile machine parts. It sold goods manufactured by it on certain prices on payment of excise duty leviable on the price on which the goods were sold. Later on, there was a revision of prices with retrospective effect. Following the revision the assessee raised supplementary invoices on its buyers and also paid the differential duty on the goods sold earlier. The Revenue took the view that the assessee was liable to pay interest on differential duty. This factual position would reflect that it was almost same that prevails in the present appeals.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: Though, the demand made in Order-in-Original was set aside by the Commissioner (Appeals) and the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) was upheld by the CESTAT holding that no interest was chargeable where there was time gap between the payment of differential duty and issuance of supplementary invoices to the customers on the basis of upward revision of prices in respect of the goods sold earlier. The said view of the Tribunal was reversed by this Court holding that interest was payable under Section 11AB of the Act. After reproducing the provisions of Section 11AB, the Court in the first instance pointed out that the aforesaid provision was not happily worded and made following remarks in this behalf:\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 9. If the object of the law is to state clearly and unambiguously the obligations of the person whom the law addresses and to spell out plainly and without any confusion the consequences of failure to discharge the obligations cast by the law then the four sections of the Act fall miles short of the desired objective. Even as originally cast the provisions were far from very happily framed and worded. Subjected to amendments from time to time those provisions have now become so complicated that in order to discern their meaning it becomes necessary to read them back and forth several times.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: We see no reason why the two periods for which interest is leviable may not be put together and dealt with in one consolidated provision instead of being split up in Sections 11-AA and 11-AB. Also, there is much scope to reorganise all the different sub-sections of Section 11-A and to present the scheme of that section in a more coherent and readable form. Be that as it may. In the case in hand we have to deal with the law as it stands now. Thereafter, the Court contrasted the provisions of Section 11A with Section 11AB and some other provisions. It also took note of the judgment of High Court of Bombay in [?CITATION?] wherein the Bombay High Court had held that Section 11AB of the Act is not applicable in such a situation. The Court, however, rejected the aforesaid view of the Bombay High Court. We would like to reproduce the relevant discussion touching the aforesaid aspect, as contained in the judgment:\n",
      "Paragraph 31: 11. Section 11-A puts the cases of non-levy or short-levy, non-payment or short-payment or erroneous refund of duty in two categories. One in which the non-payment or short-payment, etc. of duty is for a reason other than deceit; the default is due to oversight or some mistake and it is not intentional. The second in which the non-payment or short-payment, etc. of duty is by reason of fraud, collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts, or contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or of Rules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of duty; that is to say, it is intentional, deliberate and/or by deceitful means. Naturally, the cases falling in the two groups lead to different consequences and are dealt with differently.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 12\\. Section 11-A, however allow the assessees-in-default in both kinds of cases to make amends, subject of course to certain terms and conditions.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: The cases where the non-payment or short-payment, etc. of duty is by reason of fraud, collusion, etc. are dealt with under sub-section (1-A) of Section 11-A and the cases where the non-payment or short-payment of duty is not intentional under sub-section (2-B).\n",
      "Paragraph 34: 13\\. Sub-section (2-B) of Section 11-A provides that the assessee-in-default may, before the notice issued under sub-section (1) is served on him, make payment of the unpaid duty on the basis of his own ascertainment or as ascertained by a Central Excise Officer and inform the Central Excise Officer in writing about the payment made by him and in that event he would not be given the demand notice under sub-section (1). But Explanation 2 to the sub- section makes it expressly clear that such payment would not be exempt from interest chargeable under Section 11-AB, that is, for the period from the first date of the month succeeding the month in which the duty ought to have been paid till the date of payment of the duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 14\\. What is stated in Explanation 2 to sub-section (2-B) is reiterated in Section 11-AB that states where any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short-levied or short-paid or erroneously refunded, the person who has paid the duty under sub-section (2-B) of Section 11-A, shall, in addition to the duty, be liable to pay interest. It is thus to be seen that unlike penalty that is attracted to the category of cases in which the non-payment or short-payment, etc. of duty is by reason of fraud, collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts, or contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or of Rules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of duty, under the scheme of the four Sections (11-A, 11-AA, 11-AB and 11-AC) interest is leviable on delayed or deferred payment of duty for whatever reasons. The payment of differential duty by the assessee at the time of issuance of supplementary invoices to the customers demanding the balance of the revised prices clearly falls under the provision of sub-section (2-B) of Section 11-A of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 15\\. The Bombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench, in its decision in CCE v.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: Rucha Engg. (P) Ltd., (First Appeal No. 42 of 2007 decided on 3-4-2007) that was relied upon by the Tribunal for dismissing the Revenues appeal took the view that there would be no application of Section 11-A(2-B) or Section 11-AB where differential duty was paid by the assessee as soon as it came to learn about the upward revision of prices of goods sold earlier.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 16\\. In Rucha Engg. the High Court observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 39: It is evident that Section 11-AB comes into play if the duty paid/levied is short. Both, the Commissioner (Appeals) and CESTAT have observed that the assessee paid the duty on its own accord immediately when the revised rates became known to them from their customers. The differential duty was due at that time i.e. when the revised rates applicable with retrospective effect were learnt by the assessee, which was much after the clearance of the goods and, therefore, question of payment of interest does not arise as the duty was paid as soon as it was learnt that it was payable. Finding that provisions of Section 11-A(2) and 11-A(2-B) were not applicable as the situation occurred in the instant case was quite different, Section 11- AB(1) was not at all applicable, and therefore, the assessee was not required to pay interest. It further held that a case of this nature would not fall in the category where duty of excise was not paid or short-paid.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 17\\. We are unable to subscribe to the view taken by the High Court in Rucha Engg. It is to be noted that the assessee was able to demand from its customers the balance of the higher prices by virtue of retrospective revision of the prices. It, therefore, follows that at the time of sale the goods carried a higher value and those were cleared on short-payment of duty. The differential duty was paid only later when the assessee issued supplementary invoices to its customers demanding the balance amounts. Seen thus, it was clearly a case of short-payment of duty though indeed completely unintended and without any element of deceit, etc. The payment of differential duty thus clearly came under sub-section (2-B) of Section 11-A and attracted levy of interest under Section 11-AB of the Act. Fact situation in International Auto Limited was also almost similar. In that case, the assessee, viz., International Auto Limited had supplied auto parts to its customers (manufacturers of motor vehicles) who determined the prices of auto parts having regard to the cost of raw material, manufacturing cost, profit margin, etc. and placed orders with the assessee. Since price difference arose between the price on the date of removal and the enhanced price at which the goods stood ultimately sold, the Department issued show cause notice proposing to levy interest on the differential duty, paid by the assessee, under Section 11-AB of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: The assessee took up the defence that prices indicated in the purchase order were final and not liable to change at the time of removal of the goods and, thus, it was not the case of 'short levy' on which interest could be charged. After extensively quoting from the judgment of SKF India Ltd. and following the same, aforesaid contention of the assessee was repelled. In addition, the judgment also contained some further discussion on Section 11AB of the Act which needs to be taken note of. It runs as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 6. Section 11-A of the Act deals with recovery of duty not levied or not paid or short-levied or short-paid. The said section, which stood inserted by Act 25 of 1978, underwent a sea change when Parliament inserted major changes in that section vide Act 14 of 2001 (with effect from 11-5-2001) and Act 32 of 2003 (with effect from 14-5-2003). It needs to be mentioned that simultaneously Act 14 of 2001 also made changes to Section 11-AB of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 7\\. In [?CITATION?], it has been, inter alia, held, as can be seen from the abovequoted paragraphs, that sub-section (2-B) of Section 11-A provides that the assessee in default may make payment of the unpaid duty on the basis of his own ascertainment or as ascertained by a Central Excise Officer and, in that event, such assessee in default would not be served with the demand notice under Section 11-A(1) of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: However, Explanation 2 to the sub-section makes it clear that such payment would not be exempt from interest chargeable under Section 11-AB of the Act. What is stated in Explanation 2 to sub-section (2-B) is reiterated in Section 11-AB of the Act, which deals with interest on delayed payment of duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: From the scheme of Section 11-A(2-B) and Section 11-AB of the Act, it becomes clear that interest is levied for loss of revenue on any count. In the present case, one fact remains undisputed, namely, accrual of price differential. What does differential price signify? It signifies that value, which is the function of the price, on the date of removal/clearance of the goods was not correct. That, it was understated. Therefore, the price indicated by the supplementary invoice is directly relatable to the value of the goods on the date of clearance, hence, enhanced duty. This enhanced duty is on the corrected value of the goods on the date of removal. When the differential duty is paid after the date of clearance, it indicates short-payment/short- levy on the date of removal, hence, interest which is for loss of revenue, becomes leviable under Section 11-AB of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: In our view, with the entire change in the scheme of recovery of duty under the Act, particularly after insertion of Act 14 of 2001 and Act 32 of 2003, the judgment of this Court in MRF Ltd. would not apply. That judgment was on interpretation of Section 11-B of the Act, which concerns claim for refund of duty by the assessee. That judgment was in the context of the price list approved on 14-5-1983. In that case, the assessee had made a claim for refund of excise duty on the differential between the price on the date of removal and the reduced price at which tyres were sold. The price was approved by the Government. In that case, the assessee submitted that its price list was approved by the Government on 14-5-1983, but subsequent thereto, on account of consumer resistance, the Government of India directed the assessee to roll back the prices to pre-14-5-1983 level and on that account, price differential arose on the basis of which the assessee claimed refund of excise duty which stood rejected by this Court on the ground that once the assessee had cleared the goods on classification, the assessee became liable to payment of duty on the date of removal and subsequent reduction in the prices for whatever reason cannot be made a matter of concern to the Department insofar as the liability to pay excise duty was concerned.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: In the present case, we are concerned with the imposition of interest which, as stated above, is charged to compensate the Department for loss of revenue. Be that as it may, as stated above, the scheme of Section 11-A of the Act has since undergone substantial change and, in the circumstances, in our view, the judgment of this Court in MRF Ltd. has no application to the facts of this case. In our view, the judgment of this Court in SKF India Ltd. is squarely applicable to the facts of this case. Mr. Lakshmikumaran, who appeared for the assessees in these appeals, insisted on a different course of action. He adopted two pronged strategy.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: His first endeavour was to show that the judgments in the cases of SKF and International Auto were not applicable as the aforesaid cases were distinguishable. His alternate submission was that these judgments do not correctly interpret the provisions of Section 11AB of the Act and, therefore, matter required a fresh look by a Larger Bench.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: It is difficult to accept the first submission. As already pointed out above, the factual scenario in which the aforesaid two cases were decided were similar, nay, almost identical. When this Court on the basis of same type of events interpreted the provisions of Section 11AB of the Act in a particular manner and held, in no certain terms, that interest was payable, it is difficult to countenance the argument of the assessee that these cases are distinguishable on facts. Therefore, we advert to the second plank of Mr. Lakshmikumaran's submissions which was argued with all vehemence, covering the entire length and breadth of the statutory provisions with relevant case laws.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: In the first instance, he pointed out that in these appeals, there can be two distinct types of transactions: (a) where the price of the goods is 'fixed' at the time and place of removal, and as a result of subsequent negotiations (often protracted) the price is retrospectively revised by the buyer; (b) where the price at the time and place of removal is 'not fixed' (price subject to escalation clause), and the final price is agreed between the seller and buyer subsequently. According to him in the cases falling in the first category, even the differential duty is not payable. However, all these appeals fall in second category and, therefore, we are not indulging in any discussion pertaining to the first category. We may also point out that in all these appeals, the period in dispute (i.e. the period in which supplementary invoices on account of price revision were raised) is post the introduction of the 'transaction value' definition in Section of the Act, 1944 but before 2010.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: It is a common case of the parties and even the learned counsel for the assessee admits that in non-fixed price scenario, differential duty is liable to be paid on subsequent revision of price which the assessee had already paid the differential duty at or about the time when revised price was agreed upon by the seller and the buyer. The question, however, is as to whether interest thereon is payable from the date of clearance of goods when duty was paid on the basis of invoice, till the date when differential duty was paid.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: Starting from the basics, it is axiomatic that interest under Section 11AB can be levied/charged where any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid. In such an event, interest is liable to be paid 'from the first date of the month succeeding the month in which the duty ought to have been paid'. Section 4(1)(a) of the Act provides that the value of the goods shall be the price 'actually paid or payable' for the goods. This means the price which has been 'paid' or 'agreed to be paid' by the buyer of the goods. We find force in the argument of the assessee that the expression 'ought to have been paid' in Section 11AB has to be understood in this light. Thus, for the purposes of Section 11AB, the expression 'ought to have been paid' would mean the time when the price is agreed upon by the seller and the buyer. In other words, the right of the seller to receive the revised price crystallises only when the buyer agrees to sanctions the same, and only at that time can liability to pay duty, if at all, on the revised price arise. Both parties are not aware of the final price at the time when the goods are removed. In the context of price revision subsequent to clearance, duty 'ought to be paid' only after the sanctioning of the revised priced by the buyer. The differential duty on account of price revision is paid in the month when the revised price is agreed between the seller (assessee) and the buyer and it ought to have been paid only at that time and not before.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: One has also to keep in mind the difference between 'what should be the quantum of duty to be paid' and 'when such duty is payable'. In the cases price revision, the quantum of duty would be on the escalated price but the time for payment of differential duty is when the parties agree for the escalation in prices. On that reckoning, it would follow that interest clock for differential duty will start ticking from the date differential duty is due, i.e., the date of agreement of escalated prices and not before. This concept gets clarified with the latest amendment in 2015 to Section 11A with regard to the 'relevant date' for payment of interest.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: We have already taken note of judgments in SKF and International Auto including the reasons which have been given in support of the view that interest would be payable. At the outset, we may mention that the Bench did not consider the effect of the expression 'ought to have been paid' occurring in Section 11AB of the Act. It is undeniable that under Section 4 of the Act, the excise duty is to be paid on the 'transaction value' and such a transaction value has to be seen at the time of clearance of the goods. Indubitably, when the goods were cleared, the excise duty was paid taking into consideration the price that was actually charged and was reflected in the invoices raised for the said purpose. The Department cannot plead that as on that date, this was not the price charged. No doubt, when the differential payment is made at a later date, further amount towards excise duty becomes payable as a result of said differential in price. Further, such an event took place at a subsequent date. As on the date when the goods were cleared, there was no certainty that there would be price escalation and it was beyond comprehension to ascertain the exactitude of such an escalation. It would be impossible to expect the assessee to pay the excise duty, at the time of clearance of the goods, on the basis of price escalation that took place at a later date in future.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: Therefore, as on the date of clearance when excise duty was paid, it could not be treated as 'short paid' on the said date. As a consequence when the principal amount, namely, the excise duty itself was not payable (i.e. on the differential) on the date of clearance of the goods, there cannot be any question of law to pay interest.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: No doubt, on receipt of differential price, when the buyer agreed to escalation in the price, further excise duty also become payable and on that reckoning one can say that the excise duty originally paid became 'short paid'. However, that would only attract payment on differential excise duty and not the interest thereon.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: The two judgments in SKF India Ltd. and International Auto are by the same Bench. International Auto follows SKF India Ltd. The primary factor by which the Bench was influenced was that there is a loss of revenue to the Government and, therefore, the Government should compensate for that. It proceeds on the basis that the price which was originally stated at the time of removal of the goods was 'understated' (para 8 of International Auto). However, value of the goods for the purpose of duty is 'at the time of removal', as emphasised above which remains fundamental principle from the inception of the Central Excise Act originally enacted in 1944 and remains valid till date. It is, therefore, difficult to accept that the price was 'understated' on the date of removal of those goods.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: We further find that the Bench distinguished earlier three member Bench judgment in the case of [?CITATION?] on the purported ground that there was 'sea change' in Section 11A of the Act (which was originally inserted by Act 25 of 1978) when Parliament inserted major changes in that Section vide Act 14 of 2001 w.e.f. 11.05.2001, Act 32 of 2003 w.e.f. 14.05.2003 and Act 14 of 2001 whereby Section 11AB of the Act was also amended. However, we are of the opinion that amendments made to Section 11A in 2001 and 2003 have nothing to do with the valuation of the goods based on 'the price at the time of removal'. MRF was a case where a particular price was charged by the said assessee from the buyer on the date of removal and excise duty paid thereupon. However, thereafter this price was reduced on the direction of the Government. On that basis, assessee laid its claim for refund of excise duty on differential between price on the date of removal and the reduced price at which the buyers were sold on the direction of the Government. This claim of the assessee was rejected and the order upheld by this Court as well with the following discussion:\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 2. We have heard the learned counsel for the assessee. Once the assessee has cleared the goods on the classification and price indicated by him at the time of the removal of the goods from the factory gate, the assessee becomes liable to payment of duty on that date and time and subsequent reduction in Excise Department insofar as the liability to payment of excise duty was concerned. This is the view which was taken by the Tribunal in the case of [?CITATION?] and it seems to us that the Tribunal's view that the duty is chargeable at the rate and price when the commodity is cleared at the factory gate and not on the price reduced at a subsequent date is unexceptionable. Besides as rightly observed by the Tribunal the subsequent fluctuation in the prices of the commodity can have no relevance whatsoever so far as the liability to pay excise duty is concerned. That being so, even if we assume that the roll back in the price of tyres manufactured by the appellant Company was occasioned on account of the directive issued by the Central Government, that by itself, without anything more, would not entitle the appellant to claim a refund on the price differential unless it is shown that there was some agreement in this behalf with the Government and the latter had agreed to refund the excise duty to the extent of the reduced price. That being so, we see no merit in this appeal brought by the assessee and dismiss the same with no order as to costs. We, thus, are of the view that principle laid down in MRF Ltd.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: would continue to prevail.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: Mr. Lakshmikumaran argued, and we find force in this argument, that observations of the Bench in the aforesaid case that the imposition of interest is to compensate the Department for loss of revenue is contrary to the Constitution Bench judgment in the case of [?CITATION?] wherein the argument that interest was compensatory in nature was specifically rejected. The Constitution Bench considered in detail the correctness of earlier three member Bench judgment in the case of [?CITATION?] wherein majority view was that interest claimed on unpaid tax dues could be charged as it was compensatory in character and not penal. Bhagwati, J. had, however, dissented giving various reasons, one of which was that tax which has yet to be ascertained through the process of ascertainment could not be treated as tax payable from the date of submission of the return and, therefore, no interest could be charged from the date of filing of the return upto the date of assessment. This view of Bhagwati, J. was accepted after detailed discussion with the following conclusion:\n",
      "Paragraph 62: ...Our attention was, however, drawn by Mr. Sen to two cases. Even in those cases, [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?], all that the Court pointed out was that provision for charging interest was, it seems, introduced in order to compensate for the loss occasioned to the Revenue due to delay. But then interest was charged on the strength of a statutory provision may be its objective was to compensate the Revenue for delay in payment of tax. But regardless of the reason which impelled the Legislature to provide for charging interest, the Court must give that meaning to it as is conveyed by the language used and the purpose to be achieved. Therefore, any provision made in a statute for charging or levying interest on delayed payment of tax must be construed as a substantive law and not adjectival law. So construed and applying the normal rule of interpretation of statutes, we find, as pointed out by us earlier and by Bhagwati, J. in the Associated Cement Co. case, that if the Revenue's contention is accepted it leads to conflicts and creates certain anomalies which could never have been intended by the Legislature. We are conscious of the sentiments expressed by seven Judges Bench of this Court in [?CITATION?] wherein the Court sounded caution and stated the restraint that has to be exercised while dealing with the question as to whether earlier decisions of this Court should be reconsidered and revised. The Court observed that merely because two views are possible should not be a reason to review the earlier judgment as it was necessary to maintain consistency and depict certainty in law. At the same time, Court made the following remarks:\n",
      "Paragraph 63: ...That is not to say that if on a subsequent occasion, the Court is satisfied that its earlier decision was clearly erroneous, it should not hesitate to correct the error; but before a previous decision is pronounced to be plainly erroneous, the Court must be satisfied with a fair amount of unanimity amongst its members that a revision of the said view is fully justified. It is not possible or desirable, and in any case it would be inexpedient to lay down any principles which should govern the approach of the Court in dealing with the question of reviewing and revising its earlier decisions. It would always depend upon several relevant considerations-What is the nature of the infirmity or error on which a plea for a review and revision of the earlier view is based? On the earlier occasion, did some patent aspects of question remain unnoticed, or was the attention of the Court not drawn to any relevant and material statutory provision, or was any previous decision of this Court bearing on the point not noticed? Is the Court hearing such plea fairly unanimous that there is such an error in the earlier view? What would be the impact of the error on the general administration of law or on public good? Has the earlier decision been followed on subsequent occasions either by this Court or by the High Courts? And, would the reversal of the earlier decision lead to public inconvenience, hardship or mischief? These and other relevant considerations must be carefully drawn in mind whenever this Court is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to review and revise its earlier decisions. These considerations becomes still more significant when the earlier decision happens to be a unanimous decision of a Bench of five learned Judges of this Court. We have kept in mind the aforesaid consideration and feel that decision in SKF and Auto International require a re-look for the reasons given by us above. We, thus, direct the Registry to place the matter before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constituting a Larger Bench to go into the issue involved in this case which is of seminal importance having far reaching ramifications.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: Hindustan Steel Works Construction Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 'employer') calls in question legality of the judgment rendered by Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court affirming the order passed by the learned Single Judge holding that withdrawal of construction allowance which was being earlier allowed to the employees working at the Vishakhapatnam was in violation of Section 9-A of the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947]. According to the employees as urged in the writ petition it was done without following the mandatory provisions of Section 9-A and was in violation of principles of natural justice.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: Factual aspects need to be noted in brief are as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Employer started construction work of Vizag Steel Plant in 1979 and employees stationed there were paid Project/construction allowance. The employer discontinued payment of construction allowance and had paid City Compensatory allowance. The withdrawal continued w.e.f.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 7.4.1992. On 22.8.1974 a circular was issued by the employer notifying revision of pay scales w.e.f. 1.1.1974. On 17.1.1975 the Ministry of Finance, Government of India issued Office Memorandum with regard to construction projects and grant of project allowance. It was indicated therein that the allowance was intended primarily to compensate the staff for lack of amenities such as housing, schools, markets, dispensaries etc. Since November 1979 the employees were paid project/construction allowance. In 1986 a High Power Committee was appointed by this Court to go into the questions relating to the implementation of the recommendations of the Fourth Pay Commission. The final report was submitted on 2.11.1988. The issue relating to project/construction allowance was set out in Chapter 12 of the report. By order dated 3.5.1990 this Court directed implementation of the recommendations of the High Power Committee. According to the appellants there was no restriction on withdrawal of the allowance under the changed circumstances. The allowance was specific and particular in the sense that it was payable under certain circumstances.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: Questioning legality of the withdrawal writ petition was filed before the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which was allowed by the learned Single Judge. The primary challenge was that there was clear violation of the mandatory requirements of Section 9-A and, therefore, order was not sustainable. The employer questioned maintainability of the writ petition contending that efficacious alternative and statutory remedy is available under the Act and writ petition was not maintainable, particularly, when factual controversy is involved. The question whether there was violation of the requirements of Section 9-A is essentially one of facts.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: The High Court was of the prima facie view that withdrawal of the construction allowance amounted to variation of the terms and conditions of service and, therefore, there was violation of the requirements of Section 9-A of the Act. It was observed that since no factual controversy has been adjudicated, the writ petition was maintainable. Questioning correctness of the view expressed by learned Single Judge writ appeal was filed before the Division Bench which dismissed the appeal holding that the learned Single Judge was correct in his view.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench did not consider the specific plea that statutory remedy is available to the employees and for that matter the union could not have questioned the legality of the order of withdrawal of construction allowance by filing writ petition. It was further submitted that whether Section 9-A had any application to the facts of the case essentially involves questions of fact and reasoning of learned Single Judge and the Division Bench are not supportable.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: In response, learned counsel for the respondent-union submitted that both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench have noted that on the facts of the case that Section 9-A had clear application and, therefore, there is no infirmity in the judgments to warrant interference.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: In a catena of decisions it has been held that writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short 'the Constitution') should not be entertained when the statutory remedy is available under the Act, unless exceptional circumstances are made out.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: In [?CITATION?], it was held that when the dispute relates to enforcement of a right or obligation under the statute and specific remedy is, therefore, provided under the statute, the High Court should not deviate from the general view and interfere under Article 226 except when a very strong case is made out for making a departure. The person who insists upon such remedy can avail of the process as provided under the statute. To same effect are the decisions in [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 11: In Premier Automobiles Ltd. case (Supra) it was observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 12: \"A speedy, inexpensive and effective forum for resolution of disputes arising between workmen and their employers. The idea has been to ensure that the workmen do not get caught in the labyrinth of civil courts with their layers upon layers of appeals and revisions and the elaborate procedural laws, which the workmen can ill afford. The procedure followed by civil courts, it was thought, would not facilitate a prompt and effective disposal of these disputes. As against this, the courts and tribunals created by the [Industrial Disputes Act] are not shackled by these procedural laws nor is their award subject to any appeals or revisions. Because of their informality, the workmen and their representatives can themselves prosecute or defend their cases.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: These forums are empowered to grant such relief as they think just and appropriate.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: They can even substitute the punishment in many cases. They can make and re- make the contracts, settlement, wage structures and what not. Their awards are no doubt amenable to jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 as also to the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32, but they are extraordinary remedies subject to several self-imposed constraints. It is, therefore, always in the interest of the workmen that disputes concerning them are adjudicated in the forums created by the Act and not in a civil court. That is the entire policy underlying the vast array of enactments concerning workmen. This legislative policy and intendment should necessarily weigh with the courts in interpreting these enactments and the disputes arising under them\".\n",
      "Paragraph 15: Section 9-A of the Act reads as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 16: \"9-A Notice of Change - No employer, who proposes to effect any change in the conditions of service applicable to any workman in respect of any matter specified in the Fourth Schedule, shall effect such change, - (a) without giving to the workman likely to be affected by such change a notice in the prescribed manner of the nature of the change proposed to be effected; or (b) within twenty-one days of giving such notice :\n",
      "Paragraph 17: Provided that no notice shall be required for effecting any such change - (a) where the change is effected in pursuance of any (settlement or award); or (b) where the workman likely to be affected by the change are persons to whom the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules, Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, Civil Service (Temporary Service) Rules, Revised Leave Rules, Civil Services Regulations, Civilians in Defence Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules or the Indian Railway Establishment Code or any other rules or regulations that may be notified in this behalf by the appropriate Government in the Official Gazette, apply.\" In [?CITATION?], it was observed, inter alia, as follows:- \"It is hardly necessary to refer to the various decisions which were cited before us as to what would constitute conditions of service the change of which would require notice under Section 9-A of the Act. In [?CITATION?], the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India held that the increase in the weight of bags to be carried from 1 cwt. to 1 1/2 cwt. was a change in the workload and the company was bound to pay wages as the workmen were willing to work but did not work on account of the unreasonable attitude adopted by the management. In [?CITATION?], the payment of Cumbly allowance was held to have become a condition of service. In [?CITATION?] it was held that the workmen were not entitled to Puja bonus as an implied term of employment. In [?CITATION?], in the matter of withdrawal of concession of coming late by half an hour (than the usual hour), it was held that the finding of the Industrial Tribunal that Section 9-A did not apply to the case did not call for interference. But the decision proceeded on the basis that the court will not interfere in its jurisdiction unless there was any manifest injustice. In [?CITATION?],the provision for tiffin was held to be an amenity to which the employees were entitled, and the provision of cash allowance in lieu of free tiffin directed to be made by the industrial tribunal could not be considered to be erroneous in law. In [?CITATION?], \"key allowance\" was treated as a term and condition of service. In [?CITATION?], withdrawal by the management of the supply of one empty drum at a time at reasonable intervals was held not to contravene Sections 9-A and 33. In [?CITATION?], where there was nothing to show that it was a condition of service that a workman should work for 6 1/2 hours only, no notice of change was held to be required under Section 9-A for fixing the hours of work at eight. In [?CITATION?], change in weekly days of rest from Sunday to some other day was held to require notice. A close scrutiny of the various decisions would show that whether any particular practice or allowance or concession had become a condition of service would always depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and no rule applicable to all cases could be culled out from these decisions.\" (Underlined for emphasis) In [?CITATION?] the Constitution Bench of this Court observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 18: \"It is true that the powers conferred on the High Courts under Art. 226 are very wide, but it is not suggested by Mr. Chatterjee that even these powers can take in within their sweep industrial disputes of the kind which this contention seeks to raise. Therefore, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the contention, we would confirm the finding of the High Court that the proper remedy which is available to the appellants to ventilate their grievances in respect of the said notices and circulars is to take recourse to s. 10 of the [Industrial Disputes Act], or seek relief, if possible, under sections 74 and 75 of the Act.\" We find that the learned Single Judge observed that he was not entering into the factual controversy, overlooking the fact that the question relating to applicability of Section 9-A is essentially question of fact. The Division Bench did not discuss the basic issues about the applicability of Section 9-A and whether on the facts of the case Section 9-A has really any application. It was disposed of with the following observations:\n",
      "Paragraph 19: \"The employees concerned are workmen within the meaning of that term as defined under Section 2(s) of the Act and withdrawal of construction allowance from them tantamounts to a change in the conditions of service. In that view of the matter, the management of the appellant company ought not to have withdrawn the construction allowance presently paid to the employees without issuing notice envisaged under Section 9-A of the Act.\" The inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that both learned Single Judge and the Division Bench have failed to consider the basic issues. In the normal course we would have left it to the respondent to avail appropriate remedy under the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: However, because of the long passage of time (the writ petition was filed in 1997), the attendant circumstances of the case in the background noted above and in view of the agreement that this is a matter which requires to be referred to the Tribunal, we direct that the appropriate Government shall refer the following question for adjudication by the appropriate Tribunal:\n",
      "Paragraph 21: (1) Whether there was violation of Section 9-A of the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] as claimed by the employees? (2) Whether the withdrawal of the construction allowance amounted to the change in the conditions of service? The parties shall jointly move the appropriate Government with a copy of our judgment.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: Normally, it is for the State Government to take a decision in the matter of reference when a dispute is raised, the direction as noted above has been given in the circumstances indicated above.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: In some cases, this Court after noticing that refusal by appropriate Government to refer the matter for adjudication was prima facie not proper, directed reference instead of directing reconsideration. (See [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 24: The parties shall be permitted to place materials in support of their respective stands. We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent with no order as to costs.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: The framers of the Constitution of India created some Constitutional Institutions to uphold the Constitutional values; Public Service Commission being one of them. Article 315 of the Constitution of India mandates that there shall be a Public Service Commission for the Union and a Public Service Commission for each of the State. Article 320 provides for the functions of the Public Service Commission stating that it is the duty of the Union Public Service Commission and the State Public Service Commissions to conduct examinations for appointments to the services of the Union and the services of the State respectively. In relation to certain matters the Union of India and the States are enjoined with the duties to consult the Public Service Commission. With a view to uphold the dignity and independence of the Public Service Commission, the salaries, allowances and pensions payable to the members or staff of the Commission, are directed to be charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and/or the Consolidated Fund of the State. A Chairman of Public Service Commission is removable only by following the procedure laid down under the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: One Shri Ravinderpal Singh Sidhu was the Chairman of the Punjab Public Service Commission between 1996 to 2002. Allegations were made against him that he got a large number of persons appointed on extraneous consideration including monetary consideration. Such appointments were said to have been made during the period 1998 to 2001. Raids were conducted in his house on more than one occasion. A large sum of money (about Rs. 16 crores) was recovered from his custody and other relatives.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Two First Information Reports; one on 25.3.2002 being FIR No. 7/02 and the other on 30.4.2002 being FIR No. 24/02; were lodged against him in that behalf. In the said First Information Reports nine officers of PCS (Executive Branch) were named but later on the allegations against two of them, viz., Rahul and Randip were withdrawn. As against sixty three officers involved in the PCS allied services; First Information Report was lodged only against one Kamaljeet Singh. So far as appointment to the posts of Tehsildar is concerned, FIR was lodged against none.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: Result sheets of the nominated candidates were seized on 17.5.2002.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: Answer sheets of PCS (Executive Branch) were also seized. On or about 21.5.2002 the Vigilance Bureau of the State of Punjab wrote a letter to the Chief Secretary, Punjab alleging that most of the examinations held during the period of Shri Sidhu were tainted. On the next day, a memorandum of 90 pages was issued. So far as the nominated candidates are concerned, Vigilance Department of State, as noticed hereinbefore, received the answer sheets for 1998 examination and sent a report to the investigating agency on 21.5.2002. On that date itself the nominated candidates were given charge of the Executive Magistrate but on the next date, i.e., on 22.5.2002, the Vigilance Bureau on purported receipt of the details of interview of nominated candidates sent a note to a Chief Secretary whereupon orders of termination were passed on 23.5.2002. All the officers in the category of nominated executive officers were about to complete their period of probation. The services of the nominated candidates (Class I Officers) were terminated simpliciter purported to be in terms of the Rules, i.e., by terminating the probation.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: The appellants herein comprise of four categories of officers, that is to say, (1) Direct recruits in Executive Class I. In the said category services of 28 persons were terminated. (2) Direct recruits (Allied etc.) being in Executive Class II. In the said category services of 63 persons were terminated. (3) Nominated candidates being in Executive Class I. Services of 18 persons from the said category were terminated. (4) Judicial Officers.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: Judicial Officers were appointed in four batches. Four examinations were held for the respective recruitment years of 1997-98, 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-2001.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: On the judicial side, following vacancies existed:\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 1998 - 21 1999 - 14 2000 - 8 2001 - 21 Total - 64 The number of officers whose services were terminated in the aforementioned batches are 21, 14, 8, 21 respectively totalling 64 persons respectively.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: A further vigilance report was made on 7.6.2002. Admittedly no appointment was made out from the 2001 batch.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: Services of the Direct Recruit Executive Class I and Class II were terminated by way of dismissal from services vide order dated 24.8.2002 only on the premise that the criminal prosecution had been initiated against the aforementioned Shri Sidhu.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: Besides the aforementioned categories some candidates also belong to distinct categories, viz., Freedom Fighter, Handicapped, SCOP, etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: So far as the Judicial Officers are concerned, indisputably, the High Court acted on the basis of media reports alleging that wards of some sitting Judges of the Punjab and Haryana High Court have been favoured by the Chairman of the Public Service Commission. The Chief Justice of the High Court constituted a Committee chaired by a senior Judge. On a request made by the High Court answer sheets of nine candidates were handed over to the said Committee on 30.5.2002. No other record was, however, made available to the Committee. A report was submitted by the said Committee wherein recommendations were made that the appointments made of the judicial officers in all the four batches should stand cancelled although selection of the officers from the 1998 batch was not in question. The said report, however, was accepted by the Full Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: When the recommendations of the High Court were received by the Government of Punjab, a query was raised as to on what basis the recommendations for cancellation of the appointments of the 1998 batch candidates were made. Thereupon, another Committee was constituted. The Chairman of the said Committee was a member of the earlier Committee.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: The report of the Committee thereafter was again placed before the Full Court and the same was approved on 12.8.2002. The services of the Judicial Officers were terminated on 27.9.2002.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: Subsequent to the said orders of dismissal, however, no further action was taken by the State for cancellation of other examinations or termination of the officers belonging to other services. However, in regard to the examinations held in respect of the other posts, the Governor of Punjab appointed a committee on 20th July, 2004. A report was submitted by the said Committee on 20th October, 2004 stating that a distinction is possible to be made between the tainted and the non-tainted officers. It made some suggestions and recommendations in relation to the selection process to be resorted to and the appointments to be made in future.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: At this juncture, we may take note of some other relevant facts. Upon commencement of the investigation by the Vigilance Bureau one Jagman Singh became an approver. He purported to have made a statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before a learned Magistrate on 24.1.2002. Two other alleged accomplices of Shri Sidhu, viz., Shri Prem Sagar and Shri Paramjit Singh also allegedly made their statements in term of Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before a learned Magistrate on 13.5.2002. On the basis of the said statements; raids for finding out other and further incriminating materials were conducted on 19th April, 2002 at different places including the lockers/fixed deposits/bank accounts purported to have been opened by Shri Sidhu in his own name as also in the name of his relatives. Approximately a sum of Rs. 16 crores was recovered during the said raids.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: The Appellants herein along with some others being aggrieved by the said actions on the part of the State filed a large number of writ petitions before the Punjab and Haryana High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: The said writ petitions ultimately came up for hearing before a Full Bench of the said High Court. Two of the members of the said Bench were Chairmen of the two committees appointed by the learned Chief Justice.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: At the hearing of the said writ petition, however, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitioners stated that they had no objection to the said Hon'ble Judges hearing the writ petitions. On or about 30th January, 2002, the Appellants  Judicial Officers filed an application for supply of copies of the reports as also the documents including the answer books which had been relied upon by the High Court at one point of time or the other for the purpose of passing the orders of termination. The High Court claimed privilege as regards the reports of the Committee. The State of Punjab also took a stand that the contents of the report of the Vigilance Bureau could not be disclosed, as by reasons thereof, the investigation of the case may be put in jeopardy. Oral submissions on behalf of the Judicial Officers were closed on 5.2.2003 and they were asked to file written submissions by 6.2.2003; but curiously, however, on 6.2.2003, the reports of the Committee as also the mark-sheets were made available for inspection of the learned counsel.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: During hearing before the High court, interestingly, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State made a statement that those candidates who had become successful in the subsequent re-conducted interviews or re- conducted examinations, as the case may be, shall be taken back in service and their seniority would be maintained.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: The High Court reserved its judgment on 5.3.2003. On that date, some records were kept in a sealed cover. By reason of the impugned judgment which was delivered on 7.7.2003, the writ petitions were dismissed.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: The main contentions raised on behalf of the writ petitioners before the High Court were:\n",
      "Paragraph 24: (1) in terminating the services, the State committed gross violation of the provisions of Article 14, 21 and 311 of the Constitution of India;\n",
      "Paragraph 25: (2) Principles of natural justice were completely given a go-by by the Stae in passing the impugned orders of termination.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: (3) Some of the Appellants having successfully completed three years of probation, they would be deemed to have been confirmed in terms of Rule 23 of the 1976 Rules and, thus, their services could not have been terminated without holding regular inquiry in terms of Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1970 (for short, 'the 1970 Rules');\n",
      "Paragraph 27: (4) In any event, Rule 23 of the 1970 Rules could not have been invoked for dispensing with the services of such of the Appellants as it had not been shown that their work, conduct and performance were unsatisfactory during the period of probation;\n",
      "Paragraph 28: (5) No proper material by way of admissible evidence having been made available, on the basis whereof the State could form a bona fide opinion that the entire selection processes were tainted, the impugned orders of termination must be held to be bad in law.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: The contentions raised on behalf of the State, on the other hand, were that:\n",
      "Paragraph 30: (1) Shri Sidhu during his tenure from September, 1996 to March 26, 2002 exercised the powers of the Commission himself to the exclusion of all other members, which itself establishes that the selection processes were bad in law;\n",
      "Paragraph 31: (2) Writ petitions were filed by the members of the State Commission contending that Shri Sidhu had manipulated the system for ensuring the selection of only those who had paid money or had recommendations of the high authorities.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: (3) The satisfaction of the State was based upon the report of the Vigilance Bureau which included the statements made by Shri Jagman Singh which clearly pointed to the guilt of Shri Sidhu as he had disclosed that that Shri Sidhu had made a large number of appointments of the prospective candidates and during investigation it was revealed that question papers and answer scripts were smuggled out of the headquarters of the Commission and at times, blank answer sheets had been handed over to the candidates and special instructions had also been issued to the examiners to award higher marks to the less meritorious candidates and at the same time, award less marks to the more meritorious candidates.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: (5) Shri Sindhu amassed assets worth Rs. 22 crores during his chairmanship by adopting illegal means.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: (6) The entire selection process was completely vitiated and it was not possible to separate the meritorious candidates from the others although the decision to terminate all the appointments and cancellation of all the examinations was fair and bona fide.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: The contentions raised on behalf of the High Court were that:\n",
      "Paragraph 36: (1) The services of the judicial officers were terminated as it came to light that the recommendations made during the tenure of Shri Sidhu were manipulated, unfair and vitiated in law.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: (2) Two sub-committees were constituted to look into the illegalities and irregularities committed by the Commission in the matter of selection of the judicial officers and the reports submitted by them were rightly accepted by the Full Court, pursuant to and in furtherance whereof the State Government terminated their services.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: The High Court in passing the impugned judgment considered the aforementioned submissions of the parties. It noticed a large number of decisions and opined that the following propositions be culled out therefrom:\n",
      "Paragraph 39: \"(i) The rules of natural justice are not required to be followed in cases of cancellation of selection which is vitiated due to fraud, manipulation, corruption or large scale irregularities and illegalities committed by those responsible for conducting the selection.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: (ii) Even if some deserving candidates suffer on account of cancellation of such selection, the decision taken by the competent authority cannot be castigated as arbitrary or unreasonable.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: (iii) The Court cannot sustain the selection of some persons where the process of selection is vitiated due to manipulations, fraud etc. and it is in public interest that the entire selection is nullified.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: (iv) The court cannot sit in appeal over the decision of the competent authority. If some tangible material is available with the government for forming an opinion that the selection is tainted, the court cannot interfere with its decision.\" The Full Bench of the High Court, however, did not make any endeavour to make any distinction between the cases of different categories of officers, but relying on or on the basis of the reports and documents submitted by the Vigilance Bureau opined that the same revealed the following features:\n",
      "Paragraph 43: (a) Either question papers were leaked to the candidates or instructions were given to the examiners to give higher marks.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: (b) In some cases, the marks awarded to the candidates were manipulated and upgraded.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: (c) The result-sheets recovered from the Commission revealed that most of the candidates who paid money had been given very high marks in the interview.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: (d) Those candidates who secured high marks in the written examintion were given poor marks in the interview either because they were not to be selected and they had not paid money or for shunting them to the Allied Services.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: (e) The procedure for appointment of examiners was entirely controlled by Shri Ravinderpal Singh Sidhu and he gave instructions for award of specific marks to the chosen candidates.\" (f) Some of the irregularities found in the answer- books of some of the candidates selected for direct recruitment were taken into consideration by the High Court by way of illustration in arriving at its findings.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: The High Court moreover pointed out some irregularities found in the answer sheets of the some of the candidates in regard whereto 13 purported instances were noticed by it. Cases of some of the candidates who were denied selection to PCS (EB) by giving unusually low marks in the interview were highlighted in the judgment. As many as nine such cases were noticed to have been belonging to this category of irregularities. The High Court furthermore noticed the purported irregularities in the recruitments made for appointment to PCS (Judicial Branch) from the written submissions made by the State in respect whereof, cases of 10 candidates had specifically been noticed. So far as the purported similarity in grant of marks in the interview is concerned, the High Court noticed that out of the 263 candidates interviewed for selection for direct recruitment to PCS (Executive Branch) and Allied Services, 172 candidates were given identical marks by the interviewers. 230 candidates had obtained marks having difference of one mark and 58 candidates having difference of two marks. So far as the nominated candidates are concerned, the High Court noticed that no allegation could be made as regards the irregularities and illegalities in conducting the written examination, but opined:\n",
      "Paragraph 49: \"(1) In Register A-1 and Register C (year 1996) pertaining to nominated candidates, there is 100% identity for both selectees and non-selectees. In case of Register A-2 for year 1994, there is 100% identity in case of award of marks to 3 selectees.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: Considering the overall position of 18 selectees, there is a difference of 1 mark of 1 out of 3 interviewers in the marks of one candidate. Thus, same number of marks were awarded to more than 95% candidates.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: (2) Even if all the 141 nominated candidates are considered there is a difference of 1 mark in 22 out of 25 cases. Larger difference is found only in 3 cases. Then in 9 cases only one interviewer differs by 1 mark and in 1 case one interviewer differs by 2 marks. This again indicates an unusual pattern showing pre-planning and manipulation. Here also, same number of marks were awarded to more than 98% candidates.\" It furthermore noticed certain general features in respect of the marks given at the via-voce to the other candidates.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: The judgment of the High Court can be divided into two parts.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: (A) The High Court in general opined:\n",
      "Paragraph 54: \"From the above discussion and examination of the aforesaid illustrative cases and looking into the record including the statements of the alleged touts as made in court under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is no manner of doubt that it is not in a few cases only that corrupt means were adopted to secure the selection of candidates but the same modus operandi was being adopted in all the selections which vitiated the entire process of selections and that large scale corruption, irregularities, manipulation of marks and other illegalities are writ large in making selections by the Commission during the tenure of Shri Ravinderpal Singh Sidhu. We have perused the statements of the alleged touts who have given the details of the modus operandi adopted by Shri Sidhu. The examiners were instructed to award specific number of marks to the chosen candidates and pull down the others which resulted in the ouster of many meritorious candidates. In some cases, question papers were given to the candidates one evening before the examination. There has been manipulation of marks in large number of cases to ensure the selection of favoured candidates at the cost of other meritorious candidates. The entire selection process during the tenure of Shri Sidhu was indeed a one man show.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: He appointed the examiners of his confidence who were playing to his tunes and whom he could trust in carrying out his nefarious plans. He could, indeed, get any one selected who could approach him either though money or through \"Sifarish\". It is difficult to say if one could be selected on merit during the tenure of Shri Sidhu and may be some were selected on merit as well but the whole process of selection having been polluted with corruption, it is not possible to identify them. The statements as made by the alleged touts were cross checked by the Vigilance Department and the government and it was found that corruption was all pervasive in the selection of candidates to different services during the tenure of Shri Sidhu.\" [Emphasis supplied] (B) In regard to the Judicial Officers, it was opined:\n",
      "Paragraph 56: \"In the case of selection of PCS Judicial Officers, the High Court on its administrative side had also examined the records including the answer sheets and noticed that the answer sheets of some of the non-selected candidates were qualitatively better than those selected and that the performance of most of the selected candidates was below average and that the marks given to them were disproportionate to their answers which even by the most liberal standards could not be justified.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: The High Court also found that there had been large scale tampering of marks in some of the answer sheets and that selections had not been made on merit.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: During the course of arguments, the record was produced before us including the answer sheets.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: We perused quite a few of them and found that the irregularities as pointed out in the earlier part of the judgment are there. Some of the answer sheets show that there are interpolations with the marks originally allotted by the examiners and this was obviously done with a view to ensure the selection of those candidates. The State Government was, therefore, justified in cancelling the selections in entirety and no fault can be found with its decision in this regard because in these circumstances grain could not be separated from the chaff and the meritorious candidates had also to suffer.\" [Emphasis supplied] We have heard a large number of counsel appearing in the appeals representing different categories of the appellants.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: The principal submissions advanced on behalf of the appellants are:\n",
      "Paragraph 61: (1) As the appellants had become civil servants, their services were protected in terms of Article 311 of the Constitution of India, and, thus, the orders of termination having been passed without complying with the provisions of the statutory rules as also the principles of natural justice, the same were vitiated in law.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: (2) As the appellants served the State without any blemish on their part whatsoever, and having passed departmental examinations and having been given higher responsibilities, their services could not have been terminated on the basis of the purported case of mass corruption without making an attempt to separate the non-tainted candidates from the tainted ones and that too in great haste and, that too without taking into consideration the relevant materials. The impugned orders also suffer from total non-application of mind on the part of the authorities of the State.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: (3) The broad proposition, that all decisions taken during the period of Shri Sidhu were illegal, demonstrates arbitrary approach on the part of the State.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: (4) The services of the nominated candidates could not have been terminated during and/or on the expiry of the period of probation in view of the protection to the employees conferred under Article 311 of the Constitution of India could not have been ignored. In any event, during the period of probation, their service could not have been terminated without initiating an appropriate disciplinary proceeding on the ground of misconduct. Some of the probationers in view of Rule 23 of the 1976 Rules having crossed the maximum period of probation would be deemed to have been confirmed. It was pointed out that five probationers had already crossed the specified period of 3 years of probation and remaining 13 were nearing completion of the said period.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: (5) When an order of termination of services carries a clear imputation of corruption, the same would amount to dismissal from services requiring compliance of principles of natural justice.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: (6) Before the services of the probationers could be terminated the juristic foundation and stigma attached thereto were required to be considered for determining the question as to whether the dismissal was for non- satisfactory performance of service or stigmatic in nature.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: (7) While the names are registered after the selection, cancellation of the selection would mean cancellation of the entry from the register and thus, Rule 17 of the Rules were violated.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: (8) The High Court committed a serious error in holding that the orders passed by the State Government were sustainable in law relying on the decisions of this Court which can be classified as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 69: (a) Cases where the 'event' has been investigated;\n",
      "Paragraph 70: (b) Cases where tainted were separated from the non-tainted;\n",
      "Paragraph 71: (c) Cases where CBI inquiry took place and was completed conclusively;\n",
      "Paragraph 72: (d) Cases where the selection was made but appointment was not made;\n",
      "Paragraph 73: (e) Cases where the candidates were ineligible and appointments were found to be contrary to law or rules;\n",
      "Paragraph 74: (f) Cases where there was hardly any time gap in between appointment and the criminal investigation.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: (9) Writ petitioners had legitimate expectations that their services would be confirmed.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: (10) If omnibus orders based on such facts could be issued, there was no reason as to why if all the selections were tainted, no action had been taken in regard to the selections made in other years or for other services.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: (11) In view of the fact that the State Government itself had constituted a sub-committee is suggestive of the fact that the Government itself was not satisfied that the reports of the Vigilance Bureau were to be treated as sacrosanct.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: (12) The Vigilance reports were found to be otherwise based on insufficient evidence and, thus, a separate committee was felt necessary to be constituted for finding out the truth.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: (13) Before any action was taken, it was necessary for the State to satisfy itself about the allegations made therein upon verifying the contents of the reports in regard to the mal-functioning of the Punjab Public Service Commission.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: (14) The decision of the State having been taken in undue haste, the same was mala fide in nature.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: (15) The principles of natural justice have been violated as the contents of the reports of the Vigilance were not disclosed to the appellants and in any event the State could not have claimed privilege in respect thereto.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: (16) For the purpose of punishing the persons who have taken recourse to illegal measures, no honest and innocent candidate could have been punished.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: (17) The High Court acted illegally and without jurisdiction in relying upon the written submissions made on behalf of the State although, many statements made therein were not made on affidavit.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: (18) Grant of inspection of the answer sheets alone was not sufficient in the instant case as the orders passed by the State were required to be judged on the basis of the statements contained therein and supported by the affidavits.\n",
      "Paragraph 85: (19) It is not unusual that the candidates may get higher marks in the written examination and less in the interview.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: (20) As the State has alleged fraud, a heavy burden lay upon it to prove the same which is utterly failed to comply with. The High Court failed to take into consideration that the interview committees were headed by sitting Judges of the High Court and thus it is preposterous to suggest that any illegality was committed in the interviews.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: (21) Four different selection processes having been undergone in four different years, all selections could not have been painted with the same brush, so far as advertisements were separate as well as the members of the committees were different and, particularly, having regard to the fact that there was no allegation that the Chairman of the Commission could prevail over the other members as also in view of the fact that it is expert alone who gives the grading.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: (22) Out of the 10 candidates who were named in the first information report, 7 candidates belonged to 2001 batch who had not been appointed at all and, thus, only because one or two candidates happened to be the wards of sitting Judges of the High Court, although they were toppers of their batch, the services of all of them could not have been terminated.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: (23) The sub-committee in its report took notice of answer sheets of only 9 candidates and, furthermore no inquiry having been conducted in relation to the 1998 batch, the Full Court of the High Court must be held to have failed to apply its mind properly.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: (24) Two of the Hon'ble Judges who headed the sub-committees being biased, they could not have taken part in the decision making process and they should have recused themselves.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: The High Court also committed a serious error in relying upon the decisions where the principles of natural justice have been held to be inapplicable as the said cases relate to:\n",
      "Paragraph 92: (1) mass cheating adopted by the students in a Board Examination;\n",
      "Paragraph 93: (2) Where select lists have been prepared but no appointments have been made;\n",
      "Paragraph 94: (3) Where appointments have been made but eligibility criteria have been found to have been violated;\n",
      "Paragraph 95: (4) Where in no way verifications could have been made as answer sheets and other relevant documents were destroyed and the Chairman had resigned;\n",
      "Paragraph 96: (5) Where commission of mal practices were found to be apparent on the face of the records;\n",
      "Paragraph 97: Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Punjab, on the other hand, submitted that:\n",
      "Paragraph 98: (a) the principles of natural justice were not required to be complied with nor the requirements of the statutory provisions for dispensation of services of the officers in terms of Article 311 of the Constitution of India were required to be followed, as the Chairman of the Public Service Commission has usurped complete control thereover in breach of the rules as would be evident from the fact that two members of the Commission even filed writ petitions being CWP No. 14491 of 1997 and CWP No. 7952 of 2001 alleging that the Chairman had not been convening meetings of the Commission and had usurped complete control thereover.\n",
      "Paragraph 99: (b) Materials collected by the State before 23.5.2002 demonstrated commission of large scale fraud in the selection process wherefor two First Information Reports being FIR No. 7 dated 25.3.2002 and FIR No. 24 dated 30.4.2002 were registered.\n",
      "Paragraph 100: (c) During investigation, the statements of Jagman Singh were recorded which clearly demonstrated that with the help of various persons, many candidates paid huge amount to Shri Sidhu for getting selected in 1998 examinations and money, so collected, was stashed in the lockers and put in the bank accounts of the relatives of Shri Sidhu, most of whom now have left the country and have been declared as proclaimed offenders. 56 accounts were opened between the period 17.4.2002 and 19.4.2002 and over Rs.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: 16 crores were recovered from the lockers/bank accounts/fixed deposits standing in the name of the Shri Sidhu and his relatives.\n",
      "Paragraph 102: (d) A huge amount has also been transferred through Hawala transactions. The Investigating Officer had also recorded the inculpating statements of Shri Jaspreet Singh and others which clearly point out that serious illegalities were committed in the selection making process.\n",
      "Paragraph 103: (e) It is nobody's case that the Chairman did not indulge in corruption.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: (f) Upon analyzing the mark sheets and other materials, the Vigilance Bureau submitted its report wherein inter alia it was found that in 95% cases the Chairman and Members allotted identical marks in the interview to the candidates which is next to impossible as the members and the Chairman were supposed to judge the capabilities of the candidates separately which clearly show that the provision of Rule 17 (a) (iii) of the Commission Rules were flagrantly violated or breached.\n",
      "Paragraph 105: Mr. P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the High Court submitted that :\n",
      "Paragraph 106: (i) as the selection of the Judicial Officers was contaminated at source, keeping in view the nature of judicial posts, the High Court was bound to take remedial measures to restore the credibility of recruitment process and to safeguard the independence of judiciary.\n",
      "Paragraph 107: (ii) In view of the fact that the High Court found the matter to be a case of pollution of selection at the source on account of corruption, the Full Court of the High Court was convinced that the selections were vitiated and thus, no illegality has been committed in giving effect to the legal consequences arising thereunder.\n",
      "Paragraph 108: (iii) The recommendations of the sub-committees being based on some material and being in the nature of administrative decision, the standard of proof, required to be applied, would be preponderance of probability not beyond all reasonable doubts.\n",
      "Paragraph 109: (iv) In view of the well settled principles of law that justice should not only be done but manifestly also seen to be done, the selection of the Judicial Officers was not only required to be fair but also transparent.\n",
      "Paragraph 110: (v) In the fresh selection only 13 candidates were selected and 22 were not selected and in view of the fact that there was no complaint against the fresh selection, the High Court must be held to have proceeded on an objective criteria.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: (vi) It is not open to the appellants herein to allege bias on the part of the two learned Judges of the High Court on the premise that they were in the Committee as the appellants themselves had consented to their taking part in the hearing and, thus, they must be deemed to have waived their right.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: We will make endeavours to deal with the cases of different categories of officers separately as far as practicable.\n",
      "Paragraph 113: Appointments to PCS (Executive Branch) and Allied Services relate to a single recruitment process. The vacancies were of the year 1994 and 1996 and those vacancies were advertised by the Punjab Public Service Commission in terms of Advertisement No. 10 dated 7.2.1998. This advertisement pertained to 93 posts of different cadres of the State Government. Out of the aforementioned 93 posts, 28 posts were in PCS (Executive Branch).\n",
      "Paragraph 114: There were 25 additional posts to be filled up by the nominated departmental candidates. However, out of the said vacant posts only 18 were filled up. Amongst the 18 nominated candidates, 14 have been named by the witnesses in their statements recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and FIRs were lodged against them. We have noticed hereinbefore that out of total 28 candidates PCS (Executive Branch), although, at the initial stage First Information Reports were lodged only against 8 candidates, allegations against Rahul Gupta who is said to be the son of another member of the Commission and Randeep Singh were withdrawn.\n",
      "Paragraph 115: In the Allied Services out of 63 candidates, First Information Report was lodged as against only one of them. So far as those who were appointed on the post of Tehsildars are concerned, out of 19, First Information Report was lodged against none.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: It would be of some interest to note that as although in the year 1998, a large number of persons were selected in other services as for example, 365 PCMS Doctors, 60 School Principals, 147 Veterinary Officers, 422 PCMS Doctors and in the year 1999, 52 Medical Officers Dental, 147 Agriculture Development Officers, 69 Veterinary Officers and 81 Veterinary Officers in 2002 but neither any enquiry was conducted by the State in this behalf nor any action was taken to terminate the services of any of the candidates of the said service.\n",
      "Paragraph 117: The State admittedly conducted fresh interview for the nominated candidates and held fresh examinations in respect of the Executive Officers and non- Executive Officers. So far as the nominated members are concerned, three came to be re-selected out of 19 Tehsildars on the basis of PCS Exam, 1998.\n",
      "Paragraph 118: It has also been pointed out that out of 18 nominated selectees who had filed writ petitions in the High Court, only 15 candidates have filed appeals before us and 12 have been named by the witnesses although First Information Reports were initially lodged against them. So far as direct recruits to PCS (E.B.) are concerned, 18 have filed appeals before us and out of whom 7 were named by the witnesses and the First Information Reports were lodged against them. So far as the candidates selected in the Allied Services are concerned, out of 63 selected candidates only 24 have filed appeals before us and they are not named in the First Information Report or as witnesses.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: It is not in dispute that as regards PCS (E.B.) and Allied Services, the names of the selectees have been registered in different registers.\n",
      "Paragraph 120: So far as the judicial officers are concerned, First Information Report has been lodged against the ten of them. Seven candidates, out of the said ten candidates named in the First Information Report, belonged to 2001 Batch. Nobody is named in the First Information Report or figures in the statements of the witnesses in respect of the 1998 batch. The 3 candidates who have been named in the First Information Report are of 1999 batch and 2000 batch. The candidates who were selected in 2001 have not been appointed at all. We have not, thus, taken into consideration their cases.\n",
      "Paragraph 121: We at the outset would furthermore notice that having regard the submissions made before us by Mr. Dwivedi and Mr. Rao that the services of the appellants before us were terminated not in terms of the Rules but in view of the commission of illegality in the selection process involved, we need not consider the applicability of the relevant provisions of the statutes as also the effect of the provisions of Article 311 of the Constitution of India. An appointment made in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India would be void. It would be a nullity. [See [?CITATION?]] But before such a finding can be arrived at the appointing authority must take into consideration the foundational facts. Only when such foundational facts are established, the legal principles can be applied.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: If the services of the appointees who had put in few years of service were terminated; compliance of three principles at the hands of the State was imperative, viz., to establish (1) Satisfaction in regard to the sufficiency of the materials collected so as to enable the State to arrive at its satisfaction that the selection process was tainted; (2) determine the question that the illegalities committed go to the root of the matter which vitiate the entire selection process. Such satisfaction as also the sufficiency of materials were required to be gathered by reason of a thorough investigation in a fair and transparent manner; (3) Whether the sufficient material present enabled the State to arrive at satisfaction that the officers in majority have been found to be part of the fraudulent purpose or the system itself was corrupt.\n",
      "Paragraph 123: Once such findings were arrived at, all appointments traceable to the officers concerned could be cancelled. But admittedly, although there had been serious imputations against Shri Sidhu being at the helm of the affairs of the Commission, all decisions made by the Commission during his tenure are yet to be set aside. We do not intend to enter into the said controversy as we were informed at the bar that the High Court itself is in sesin of the matter. We may, however, note that Mr. Dwivedi in his usual frankness stated that there may not be any answer to that query.\n",
      "Paragraph 124: Apart from inferences drawn on certain facts and in particular the circumstances enumerated by the High Court which have been repeated by the learned counsel for the State before us, it is difficult to accept that it was demonstrated by the State that it was absolutely impossible for it to separate the innocent people from the tainted ones.\n",
      "Paragraph 125: It is also not a case where all the relevant records have been destroyed. The Vigilance Bureau does not say so. Questions papers, answer sheets and other documents are available. Reports made by the Bureau were prepared upon examination of the materials collected by it. The High Court itself has noticed that what is not available is the records relating to the procedure adopted in regard to the appointment of paper setters. It may be true that such records could be destroyed only after a period of five years but it has not been pointed out by the State as to how by reason of the non- availability thereof, it became difficult for the authorities to arrive at the correct facts. We have not been informed that connecting materials were also destroyed. It has been noticed by the High Court that all relevant information were available and submitted to the court. It cannot, therefore, be said that a fair investigation into the whole affair was an impossible task or despite availability of all such records a thorough investigation had been made so as to arrive at a satisfaction that the entire selection process suffered from a large scale fraud. It was also not been found that all appointments were made on extraneous considerations including monetary consideration.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: If fraud in the selection process was established, the State should not have offered to hold a re-selection. Seniority of those who were re-selected ordinarily could not have been restored in their favour. Such an offer was evidently made as the State was not sure about the involvement of a large number of employees.\n",
      "Paragraph 127: A distinction moreoever exists between a proven case of mass cheating for a board examination and an unproven imputed charge of corruption where the appointment of a civil servant is involved.\n",
      "Paragraph 128: In [?CITATION?], the court came to a finding that the high percentage of marks obtained by the candidates who appeared at the selection of the centre in question did give rise to a suspicion that unfair means had been practised and the Board was justified in investigating the case. While the High Court held that despite the same, the principles of natural justice was required to be complied with; this Court noticed the reports of the experts and came to the conclusion that the results thereof speaks for themselves. It was noticed that whereas in other centers the average of successful candidates was 50%, in the center in question, the percentage of passing in different papers were unusually high ranging from 70% to 100%. In that view of the matter, this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 129: \"These figures speak for themselves. However, to satisfy ourselves we ordered that some answer books be brought for our inspection and many such were produced. A comparison of the answer books showed such a remarkable agreement in the answers that no doubt was left in our minds that the students had assistance from an outside source.\n",
      "Paragraph 130: Therefore the conclusion that unfair means were adopted stands completely vindicated.\n",
      "Paragraph 131: This is not a case of any particular individual who is being charged with adoption of unfair means but of the conduct of all the examinees or at least a vast majority of them at a particular centre. If it is not a question of charging any one individually with unfair means but to condemn the examination as ineffective for the purpose it was held. Must the Board give an opportunity to all the candidates to represent their cases? We think not. It was not necessary for the Board to give an opportunity to the candidates if the examinations as a whole were being cancelled.\n",
      "Paragraph 132: The Board had not charged any one with unfair means so that he could claim to defend himself.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: The examination was vitiated by adoption of unfair means on a mass scale. In these circumstances it would be wrong to insist that the Board must hold a detailed inquiry into the matter and examine each individual case to satisfy itself which of the candidates had not adopted unfair means. The examination as a whole had to go.\" Such is not the case here.\n",
      "Paragraph 134: In [?CITATION?], an error was found out at the stage of calling candidates for interview. This Court opined that as no defect was pointed out in regard to the written examination and the sole objection was confined to the exclusion of a group of successful candidates in interview there was no justification for cancelling the written part of the recruitment examination and the situation could have been appropriately met by setting aside the recruitment and asking for fresh interview of all eligible candidates on the basis of the written examination.\n",
      "Paragraph 135: Yet again in [?CITATION?] the court refused to interfere with the result of the examination as it was shown that there had been neither any mass copying nor the final result was shown to have been influenced by the unfair means by any candidate.\n",
      "Paragraph 136: In those cases also tainted cases were separated from the non-tainted cases. Only, thus, in the event it is found to be an impossible or highly improbable, en masse orders of termination could have been issued.\n",
      "Paragraph 137: Both the State Government as also the High Court in that view of the matter should have made all endeavours to segregate the tainted from the non-tainted candidates.\n",
      "Paragraph 138: We may, at this stage, notice that the following cases would fall in the different categories which are enumerated hereinbelow:\n",
      "Paragraph 139: (i) Cases where the 'event' has been investigated:\n",
      "Paragraph 140: (a) [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 141: (b) [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 142: (c) [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 143: (d) [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 144: (e) [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 145: (f) [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 146: (ii) Cases where CBI inquiry took place and was completed or a preliminary investigation was concluded:\n",
      "Paragraph 147: (a) O. Chakradhar (supra) (b) Krishan Yadav (supra) (c) Hanuman Prasad (supra) (iii) Cases where the selection was made but appointment was not made:\n",
      "Paragraph 148: (a) Dilbagh Singh (supra) at paragraph 3 (b) [?CITATION?] (c) Anand Kumar Pandey (supra) at paragraph 4.\n",
      "Paragraph 149: (d) Hanuman Prasad (supra) (e) B. Ramanjini (supra) at paragraph 4.\n",
      "Paragraph 150: (iv) Cases where the candidates were also ineligible and the appointments were found to be contrary to law or rules:\n",
      "Paragraph 151: (a) Krishan Yadav (supra) (b) [?CITATION?] wherein appointments had been made without following the selection procedure.\n",
      "Paragraph 152: (c) O. Chakradhar (supra) wherein appointments had been made without type- writing tests and other procedures of selection having not been followed.\n",
      "Paragraph 153: It is now well-settled that a decision is an authority for what it decides and not what can logically be deduced therefrom. It is also well settled that a ratio of case must be understood having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein. [See [?CITATION?] [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]]. In [?CITATION?], this Court repelled a contention raised therein that in view of the findings of the Public Inquiry Commission that there has been tampering of marks in respect of several candidates and as such there has been no fair and objective selection, public interest demanded annulment of the entire selection. This Court held that the same could not be done as the same would tantamount to gross violation of principles of natural justice which cannot be brushed aside on the ground that public interest demands annulment of the selection.\n",
      "Paragraph 154: Yet again in [?CITATION?], this Court while dealing with a case of en masse cancellation of the licences granted to the LPG Distributors as a result whereof unequals were said to have been clubbed by reason of arbitrary exercise of executive power, the same was held to be impermissible stating:\n",
      "Paragraph 155: \"The solution by resorting to cancellation of all was worse than the problem. Cure was worse than the disease. Equal treatment to unequals is nothing but inequality. To put both the categories \u0017 tainted and the rest \u0017 on a par is wholly unjustified, arbitrary, unconstitutional being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution\" It was further held:\n",
      "Paragraph 156: \"The aforesaid observations would apply with equal if not more force to DSBs if media exposure that the allotments were made either to the high political functionaries themselves or their near and dear ones is correct, the authorities would not only be justified in examining such cases but it would be their duty to do so. Instead of fulfilling that duty and obligation, the executive cannot unjustly resort to cancellation of all the allotments en masse by treating unequals as equals without even prima facie examining any cases exposed by the media\" This Court further observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 157: The expression \"public interest\" or \"probity in governance\" cannot be put in a straitjacket. \"Public interest\" takes into its fold several factors. There cannot be any hard-and-fast rule to determine what is public interest. The circumstances in each case would determine whether government action was taken in public interest or was taken to uphold probity in governance.\n",
      "Paragraph 158: The role model for governance and decision taken thereof should manifest equity, fair play and justice. The cardinal principle of governance in a civilized society based on rule of law not only has to base on transparency but must create an impression that the decision-making was motivated on the consideration of probity. The Government has to rise above the nexus of vested interests and nepotism and eschew window- dressing. The act of governance has to withstand the test of judiciousness and impartiality and avoid arbitrary or capricious actions. Therefore, the principle of governance has to be tested on the touchstone of justice, equity and fair play and if the decision is not based on justice, equity and fair play and has taken into consideration other matters, though on the face of it, the decision may look legitimate but as a matter of fact, the reasons are not based on values but to achieve popular accolade, that decision cannot be allowed to operate.\" Yet again in [?CITATION?], this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 159: \"Applying a unilaterally rigid and arbitrary standard to cancel the entirety of the selections despite the firm and positive information that except 31 of such selected candidates, no infirmity could be found with reference to others, is nothing but total disregard of relevancies and allowing to be carried away by irrelevancies, giving a complete go-by to contextual considerations throwing to the winds the principle of proportionality in going farther than what was strictly and reasonably to meet the situation. In short, the competent authority completely misdirected itself in taking such an extreme and unreasonable decision of cancelling the entire selections, wholly unwarranted and unnecessary even on the factual situation found too, and totally in excess of the nature and gravity of what was at stake, thereby virtually rendering such decision to be irrational.\" [See also [?CITATION?]] The High Court, therefore, cannot be said to be right in applying the principle of mass cheating cases in the instant case.\n",
      "Paragraph 160: Contention of Mr. Dwivedi, as noticed hereinbefore, centers around condemnation of selection and not of the candidate. But, when the services of the employees are terminated inter alia on the ground that they might have aided and abated corruption and, thus, either for the sake of probity in governance or in public interest their services should be terminated; the court must satisfy itself that conditions therefor exist. The court while setting aside a selection may require the State to establish that the process was so tainted that the entire selection process is liable to be cancelled. We, however, do not agree with the submission of Mr. Dhavan that the decision of the Commission was collegiate in nature as it is well known that one of the members of the Commission was biased, other members could also be influenced by him. [See [?CITATION?]] In a case of this nature, thus, the question which requires serious consideration is as to whether due to misdeed of some candidates, honest and meritorious candidates should also suffer.\n",
      "Paragraph 161: It is not in dispute that the State itself appointed a Screening Committee by an order dated 20th July, 2004 in the following terms:\n",
      "Paragraph 162: \"Whereas during the period 1996-2001, a total number of about 1681 selections involving 141 categories of employees were made by the PPSC.\n",
      "Paragraph 163: And whereas an enquiry has been held by the Vigilance Bureau in these selections and a report has been submitted by the Vigilance Bureau to the Government. The State Government has now to take a view as to the action it may have to take regarding all these selections made during the years 1996-2001. After detailed deliberation and discussions in this regard with the concerned Departments, Advocate General Punjab, Legal Remembrancer and Vigilance Bureau, the Government has decided to constitute a Committee of Senior Officers to examine the report of the Vigilance Bureau in the light of the records of PPSC and sift the evidence in each case of selection made during the tenure of Sh. Ravinder Pal Singh Sidhu as Chairman, Punjab Public Service Commission and determine whether irregularities or illegalities were committed in making these selections.\n",
      "Paragraph 164: The composition of the above Screening Committee was:\n",
      "Paragraph 165: 1\\. Shri D.S. Guru, IAS, Principal Secretary Department of Health & Family Welfare, Punjab. - Chairman.\n",
      "Paragraph 166: 2\\. Legal Remembrancer, Punjab  Member.\n",
      "Paragraph 167: 3\\. Sh. S.M. Sharma, IPS, Inspector General of Police, (Vigilance) Punjab  Member\n",
      "Paragraph 168: 4\\. Sh. S.S. Rajput, IAS, Secretary to Govt. of Punjab, Deptt. Of Personnel.  Member.\" The subject reference before the Committee was:\n",
      "Paragraph 169: \"A total number of 1680 selections involving 141 categories of employees were examined by the Vigilance Bureau. The Punjab Government decided to constitute a Screening Committee to examine the report of the Vigilance Bureau in the light of the records of the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) and to shift the evidence in each case of selection made during the tenure of Shri Ravinder Pal Singh Sidhu as Chairman, Punjab Public Service Commission and determine whether irregularities or illegalities were committed in making these selections.\" The Screening Committee found the following two selections as vitiated:\n",
      "Paragraph 170: \"(i) Selection to the post of sub-Divisional Engineer (Civil), PWD, B & R & sub-Divisional Officer (Civil) in Panchayati Raj Department;\n",
      "Paragraph 171: (ii) Selections of Lecturers Mechanical Engineering for Government Polytechnics.\" The functions of the Screening Committee in terms of the order of reference were as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 172: \"(i) The Committee will examine the Vigilance Bureau Reports and the records of PPSC regarding selections made to posts in different departments on the basis of recommendations of Punjab Public Service Commission during the tenure of Shri Ravinder Pal Singh Sidhu and give its findings as to the attendant circumstances of the selections effected.\n",
      "Paragraph 173: (ii) The Committee may examine any other issue specially referred to it regarding the selections made during the tenure of Sh. Ravinder Pal Singh Sidhu.\n",
      "Paragraph 174: (iii) Original record from the Departments will be obtained and submitted to the Committee by the Vigilance Department. The Committee will hold at least one meeting every week as per its convenience and submit its final report within six months.\" We are not unmindful of the controversy that the said Committee did not go into the question of illegality in the selection of the Civil Services Examinations or Judicial Examinations. It might or might not have; but we are referring to the said report not only to place on record that such a Committee was constituted inter alia for the purpose of implementing the order of Punjab and Haryana High Court passed in CWP No. 77/02 but also for the purpose that even according to the State sifting of evidence by an independent body was possible. The Committee, as noticed hereinbefore, was furthermore required to determine the question as to whether illegalities and irregularities of such a magnitude had been committed or not. It further appears from the report that the Screening Committee visited the office of the Commission. It noticed that the Vigilance Bureau did not go into the issue of role of experts and did not produce any concrete evidence before the Committee in regard to any other illegality committed by the experts. It although noticed the basis for the Vigilance Bureau to arrive at certain inferences that the selection process had become tainted, but despite the same went into various facts including similarity of marks given at the interview despite the amendments made by the Commission vide a resolution dated 14.3.1995 and other relevant factors.\n",
      "Paragraph 175: The Committee opined:\n",
      "Paragraph 176: \"The S.P., Vigilance Bureau, Patiala also stated before the Committee that after the submission of the report, no other additional evidence or piece of information has come to their knowledge. The Committee is of the considered view that marks in the interview cannot be given pro rata to the academic qualifications and if this principle is adopted, it will hit at the very base of adjudging the personality, general awareness, general knowledge and other traits in the personality of a candidate by the Selection Board. Although the high marks awarded to some candidates in the interview and low marks awarded to some others are quite striking, vis-`-vis their academic performance, in a number of cases, especially those placed by the Vigilance Bureau in the 'tainted' categories, yet the Committee is of the considered view that in the absence of concrete/conclusive evidence of any extraneous considerations like corruption, favouritism, nepotism, etc., the selections cannot per se be described to be vitiated.\" Another factor which merits consideration is as to whether even if the statements of approver and other witnesses are taken to be correct, the selection made in the year 1998 could be said to be so tainted so as to vitiate the entire selection process. Jagaman Singh merely stated that only in 1999 Shri Sidhu upon taking him into confidence disclosed that he had some surplus amount with him. It is stated before us that he has not implicated any candidate for the year 1998-99 by name. Some of the statements made by him are said to be with regard to the recovery part and not in regard to the validity or otherwise of the examination and other selection processes. It was, therefore, necessary to establish that the examinations held in 1998 were also tainted. Some evidence in that behalf should have been brought on record to establish the necessary tint.\n",
      "Paragraph 177: It is not in dispute that in respect of the services where selections were made on the basis of the interview, the same was conducted by the Chairman and two other members. On each subject one expert was also appointed.\n",
      "Paragraph 178: We place on record that so far as the Judicial Officers are concerned the expert was a sitting High Court Judge and, thus, it is not expected that any irregularity far less illegality would be committed in the matter of allotment of marks at the interview. In any event, it was necessary to arrive at such a finding.\n",
      "Paragraph 179: We may notice Rule 17 (a) (iii) of the Rules framed by the Commission which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 180: \"(iii) Where more than one member constitute a board for holding the interview, the senior most Member shall preside assisted by the subject Expert(s). Each Member of the Board shall record his evaluation marks on the award sheets separately after general discussion with the Expert(s). After the interview each member shall seal his award sheet in a separate cover and pass it on to the Secretary who shall place all the award covers in a master cover, seal it withy the seals of the Members and keep it in his own safe custody.\" No breach of Rule 17 (a) (iii) as such has been pointed out either before the High Court or before us. Thus, the possibility of the Chairman and the Members of the Commission to deliberate on the performance of the candidates with each other and general discussion with the expert which might have led to grant to similar marks cannot be wholly ruled out.\n",
      "Paragraph 181: Suspicion is no substitution of proof. There may be some cases where such marks had been given for extraneous considerations, but only because there was such a possibility, the same by itself without analyzing more may not be a ground for arriving at the conclusion that the entire selection process was vitiated. Apart from viva voce, other marks remained the same. The Officers had passed other departmental examinations and so far as performance of their duties is concerned presumably there had been no complaint.\n",
      "Paragraph 182: We may, furthermore, at this stage take note of the fact that so far as the entries in the registers are concerned the same are governed by Rule 8 of the 1976 Rules, in terms whereof the following registers are required to be maintained:\n",
      "Paragraph 183: REGISTER CLASS OF OFFICERS RULE Register A-1 Tehsildars and Naib Tehsildars Rule 8 (1) of the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) (Class-I) Rules, 1976 Register A-2 Temporary members of Class II and members of Class III services serving in connection with the affairs of the State of Punjab and holding Ministerial appointments.\n",
      "Paragraph 184: Rule 8 (2) of the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) (Class-I) Rules, 1976 Register A-3 Excise and Taxation Officers, Block Development and Panchayat Officers and District Development and Panchayat Officers Rule 8 (3) of the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) (Class-I) Rules, 1976 Register B Officers accepted as a result of the Main Competitive Examination.\n",
      "Paragraph 185: Rule 8 (4) of the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) (Class-I) Rules, 1976 Register C Officers and Officials serving in connection with the State of Punjab who are not covered by any of the categories of officers or officials herein before mentioned.\n",
      "Paragraph 186: Rule 8 (5) of the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) (Class-I) Rules, 1976 Different registers were, therefore, required to be maintained for different categories of officers. We have not been apprised that there had been any violation in that behalf.\n",
      "Paragraph 187: Furthermore, a decision in undue haste was taken. So far as the nominated officers are concerned, whereas a note containing 90 pages was sent to the Chief Secretary of Punjab on 22.5.2002, the services of all the officers were terminated on the next day. Apart from the materials which have been relied on in the report, no further evidence was probably brought in between 23.5.2002 and 24.8.2002 when the services of the Executive Officers were terminated.\n",
      "Paragraph 188: It is, thus, furthermore, beyond anybody's comprehension as to why action had to be taken in undue haste.\n",
      "Paragraph 189: We do not intend to suggest that in any emergency it was not permissible but we have not been shown that any such emergent situation existed. It was in any event necessary for the State to show as to how the records moved so as to satisfy the conscience of the court that there had been proper and due application of mind on the part of the concerned authorities.\n",
      "Paragraph 190: An action taken in undue haste may be held to be mala fide. [See [?CITATION?]] We may now deal with the orders of termination of the services of the Judicial Officers.\n",
      "Paragraph 191: We may at the outset notice that no reason as to why copies of the vigilance report could not have been made available to the learned advocates appearing for the judicial officers. At least, they could have been given inspection thereof.\n",
      "Paragraph 192: From the records produced before us it appears that the Advocate General, Punjab by a letter dated 23.5.2002 handed over 12 envelops which are as under:\n",

      "Paragraph 195: The report of the first committee dated 30th May, 2002 is a short one.\n",
      "Paragraph 196: The said report is based on the extracts of the statements made by some of the persons recorded by the investigating agency and the photostat copies of the answer sheets of nine candidates who, amongst others, had been selected and appointed to the PCS(Judicial) during the period from 1999 to 2001 along with the question papers for the relevant examinations.\n",
      "Paragraph 197: The materials supplied to the Committee, having regard to the fact that most of the officers named in the First Information Report were of 2001 batch, cannot be held to be sufficient so as to come to the conclusion that the entire selection process for 1999 and 2000 was vitiated. Despite the fact that the selection process for the year 1998 was not the subject matter of the enquiry, recommendations had been made by the Committee for cancellation of appointment of the candidates of 1998 batch also. The Full Court without any basis whatsoever recommended dismissal of all the Judicial Officers. Only when the Additional Secretary of the Government of Punjab vide a letter dated 27.9.2002 which was received by the High Court on 28.9.2002, drew its attention in that behalf, another committee was constituted by the then Acting Chief Justice on 10.10.2002 evidently, after the said matter was discussed in the Full Court. Two of the five member Committee were also the members of the first Committee. The second Committee again considered the statements of the approver and one other witness recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as also other documents placed before it and came to the opinion: (1) Performance of most of the selected candidates was below average and the marks awarded to them were disproportionate to the answers given by them.\n",
      "Paragraph 198: (The aforementioned opinion was made on the basis of some of the answer sheets of some of the selected candidates and those who had not been selected.) (2) The marks originally given to the candidates were scored off and unjustifiably increased obviously with a view to ensure their selection.\n",
      "Paragraph 199: (3) Another feature which was noticed that the answer sheets of some of the non-selected candidates were qualitatively better than some of those who had been selected but they had been awarded lesser marks, presumably, with a view to push them down.\n",
      "Paragraph 200: The number of the candidates of 1998 batch was not that high so as to render examination of each answer book of the candidates difficult.\n",
      "Paragraph 201: Having regard to the fact that none of the candidates of 1998 batch had been named in the First Information Report or by the witnesses, it was, to our mind, obligatory on the part of the High Court to bestow its attention to the problem more closely. Maintenance of purity of administration of justice so as to uphold the independence of judiciary is indisputably the sole task of the High Court. However, it is important to maintain purity of administration of justice both on the judicial side as also the administrative side. Corruption in the selection process and in any event illegality going to the root of the matter, of course, would not be tolerated. But then even applying the strict standard in the case of the judicial officers, whereas applying liberal standard in the case of others, at least certain basic norms were required to be followed. For the said purpose, minimal requirements of the principles of natural justice must be complied with. We regret to note that judicial officers had not been fairly treated by the High Court. They deserved better treatment. An authority holding an enquiry of such a nature would ordinarily carry out exercises to find out as to whether the selection process was vitiated by fraud or such illegalities which would vitiate the entire selection process. The Committee was dealing with charges of aiding and abetting corruption on the part of the judicial officers nay only some of them and, thus, it was necessary for it to apply its mind more seriously. The members of the Committee were not reevaluating the answer scripts. The candidates were not before them. Their abilities were not being tested. The learned members of the Committee should have asked unto themselves the right question, mainly because the issue before them was different and distinct from an ordinary departmental enquiry. In any event, there was absolutely no reason why copies of the said reports could not have been supplied to the appellants.\n",
      "Paragraph 202: Before us the said reports have been placed. We have allowed the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants to inspect them.\n",
      "Paragraph 203: Some brief comments about the said reports had been made. However, we do not intend to delve deep into the matter, as we are of the opinion that the actions taken on the basis of the said reports by the High Court were not justified.\n",
      "Paragraph 204: We also fail to understand as to why two senior Judges who had headed the Committee should have been made part of the Bench. It was not a case where the doctrine of necessity was required to be invoked. It may be that the counsel appearing on behalf of the Judicial Officers did not object to the learned Judges who were members of the Committee to hear the matter.\n",
      "Paragraph 205: There is no quarrel with the proposition that the allegation of bias may be capable of waived. [See [?CITATION?]] However, in this case, bias as regards the subject matter on the part of the members of the Committee who heard the writ petition is apparent on the face of the record. Therein this Court was considering a question as to whether a bias as regards a special matter would invalidate proceedings. What was in question therein was the justifiability of the constitution of selection committee and as the Appellant therein had voluntarily appeared before it and had taken a chance of having favourable recommendation from it, he was not permitted to turn around and question the validity of the constitution of the committee.\n",
      "Paragraph 206: In [?CITATION?], the concession of the counsel recorded by the High Court was incorrect. But the Appellant was not permitted to go back from the said concession, stating:\n",
      "Paragraph 207: \"So the Judges' record is conclusive. Neither lawyer nor litigant may claim to contradict it, except before the Judge himself, but nowhere else.\" In [?CITATION?], this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 208: \"The basic principle underlying this rule is that justice must not only be done but must also appear to be done and this rule has received wide recognition in several decisions of this Court. It is also important to note that this rule is not confined to cases where judicial power stricto sensu is exercised. It is appropriately extended to all cases where an independent mind has to be applied to arrive at a fair and just decision between the rival claims of parties. Justice is not the function of the courts alone; it is also the duty of all those who are expected to decide fairly between contending parties. The strict standards applied to authorities exercising judicial power are being increasingly applied to administrative bodies, for it is vital to the maintenance of the rule of law in a Welfare State where the jurisdiction of administrative bodies is increasing at a rapid pace that the instrumentalities of the State should discharge their functions in a fair and just manner\" The manner in which the proceedings were conducted in the High Court leaves much to be desired.\n",
      "Paragraph 209: The writ petitioners, thus, might have waived their right to raise a contention as regard bias on the part of the Hon'ble Judges but the same would not mean that this Court would ignore such a vital fact. It was clearly a case where the Hon'ble Judges should have recused themselves from hearing the matter. It was for them to remind themselves that justice is not only done but manifestly seen to be done. [See [?CITATION?]] In [?CITATION?] Lord Browne Wilkinson opined:\n",
      "Paragraph 210: \"The question then arises whether in non-financial litigation, anything other than a financial or proprietary interest in the outcome is sufficient automatically to disqualify a man from sitting as judge in the cause. My Lords, in my judgment, although the cases have all dealt with automatic disqualification on the grounds of pecuniary interest, there is no good reason in principles for so limiting automatic disqualification. The rationale of the whole rule is that man cannot be judge in his own cause.\" It was further opined:\n",
      "Paragraph 211: \"One of the cornerstones of our legal system is the impartiality of the tribunals by which justice is administered. In civil litigation the guiding principle is that no one may be a judge in his own cause: nemo debt esse judex in propria causa the nature of the interest is such that public confidence in the administration of justice requires that the judge must withdraw from the case or, of he fails to disclose his interest and sits in judgment upon it, the decision cannot stand. It is no answer for the judge to say that he is in fact impartial and that he will abide by his judicial oath.\" It was also stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 212: \"However, I am of the opinion that there could be cases where the interest of the judge in the subject matter of the proceedings arising from his strong commitment to some cause or belief or his association with a person or body involved in the proceedings could shake public confidence in the administration of justice as much as shareholding in a public company involved in litigation.\" [See also [?CITATION?]] Pinochet (supra) applies in all force to the fact of the case.\n",
      "Paragraph 213: The aforementioned principles have been accepted and followed by this Court in [?CITATION?] in the following terms:\n",
      "Paragraph 214: \"Recently however, the English Courts have sounded a different note, though may not be substantial but the automatic disqualification theory rule stands to some extent diluted. The affirmation of this dilution however is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the matter in issue. The House of Lords in the case of R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex p Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2)observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 215: \" In civil litigation the matters in issue will normally have an economic impact; therefore a Judge is automatically disqualified if he stands to make a financial gain as a consequence of his own decision of the case. But if, as in the present case, the matter at issue does not relate to money or economic advantage but is concerned with the promotion of the cause, the rationale disqualifying a Judge applies just as much if the Judge's decision will lead to the promotion of a cause in which the Judge is involved together with one of the parties.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 216: 31\\. Lord Brown-Wilkinson at p.136 of the report stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 217: \"It is important not to overstate what is being decided. It was suggested in argument that a decision setting aside the order of 25-11-1998 would lead to a position where Judges would be unable to sit on cases involving charities in whose work they are involved. It is suggested that, because of such involvement, a Judge would be disqualified. That is not correct. The facts of this present case are exceptional. The critical elements are (1) that A.I. was a party to the appeal; (2) that A.I. was joined in order to argue for a particular result; (3) the Judge was a director of a charity closely allied to A.I. and sharing, in this respect, A.I.'s objects. Only in cases where a Judge is taking an active role as trustee or director of a charity which is closely allied to and acting with a party to the litigation should a Judge normally be concerned either to recuse himself or disclose the position to the parties. However, there may well be other exceptional cases in which the Judge would be well advised to disclose a possible interest.\" 32\\. Lord Hutton also in Pinochet case observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 218: \"There could be cases where the interest of the Judge in the subject-matter of the proceedings arising from his strong commitment to some cause or belief or his association with a person or body involved in the proceedings could shake public confidence in the administration of justice as much as a shareholding (which might be small) in a public company involved in the litigation.\" [See also [?CITATION?] and Krishan Yadav (supra)] It is not necessary for us, in the facts and circumstances of this case, to give our final views as regard the current rein in the precedent, i.e., from likelihood of bias to 'real danger of bias' as was observed in [?CITATION?] but we may only observe that if the principles of bias which have been highlighted by Mr.\n",
      "Paragraph 219: Rao for attacking the conduct of Mr. Sindhu as a Constitutional functionary are correct, there is no reason as to why the same principles would not apply to the case of judicial officers. The apprehension in the mind of judicial officers that inferences had been drawn on the basis of non-existent fact cannot be ruled out. It was in the aforementioned premise, the officers should have at least been given an opportunity to have a look to the reports on the basis whereof they had been categorized as tainted officers. We fail to understand if ultimately in the opinion of the High Court, the Judicial Offices were found to be entitled to look the said report, why the copies thereof were not made available to them or at least why inspection thereof was not given at an appropriate time so as to enable them to make their submissions. Curiously enough only when after the oral submissions were over and written submissions have been filed, although the writ petition belonging to other categories of services were being heard, the arguments advanced on behalf of the Judicial Officers were directed to be closed and only on the next date when the counsel had no occasion to make comments upon the reports, the same were read out in the Court and allowed to be inspected by the counsel. It may be that the Superior Judiciary always make endeavours to deal with the judicial officers in all seriousness it deserves;\n",
      "Paragraph 220: but then such harsh punishments may be meted out only when there are sufficient materials on record so as to enable it to satisfy itself upon adopting a fair procedure. We have no hesitation to observe that the Judicial Officers were unfairly treated by the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 221: The High Court was probably enthralled by the media reports that two of the wards of its sitting Judges obtained appointment wrongly. It is, however, stated at the Bar that they were toppers of the Batch and in the First Information Reports, their names had not been mentioned. Only because wards of its sitting Judges obtained employment, the same by itself would not give rise to a presumption that everything was not well in the selection making process.\n",
      "Paragraph 222: We, having regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, are of the opinion that it is necessary to direct consideration of the matters afresh. We have not been apprised whether in the criminal cases any further material had been gathered so as to implicate the appellants before us.\n",
      "Paragraph 223: We were, however, told that some new appointments have been made, the effect whereof, would certainly be the subject to the decision of this case.\n",
      "Paragraph 224: We, however, do not intend to set aside the said appointments at this stage.\n",
      "Paragraph 225: We also do not intend to disturb the status quo.\n",
      "Paragraph 226: We must, however, express our satisfaction that no candidate for the year 2001 has been appointed. It is one thing to say that having regard to the nature of selection process, no person is appointed from the select list as no person has right to be appointed only because his name appears in the select list, but, in our opinion, a different standard must be adopted for terminating the services of the officers who had completed about three years of service.\n",
      "Paragraph 227: Some of them, as noticed hereinbefore, passed departmental tests. Some have been given higher responsibilities. They had completed the period of probation and some were nearing the completion thereof. They presumably had been working to the satisfaction of the authorities concerned.\n",
      "Paragraph 228: The impugned judgment as also the orders of the State Government and the High Court are, thus, liable to be set aside and directions are issued.\n",
      "Paragraph 229: Although the impugned judgments cannot be sustained, we are of the opinion that the interest of justice would be subserved if the matters are remitted to the High Court for consideration of the matters afresh. However, with a view to segregate between the tainted with non-tainted and that in the interest of justice the High Court should be requested to constitute two independent scrutiny committees  one relating to the executive officers and the other relating to the judicial officers.\n",
      "Paragraph 230: We would, furthermore, request the High Court to consider the desirability of delineating the area which would fall for consideration by such Committees within a time frame. Copies of such reports of the Committees shall be supplied to the learned counsel for the petitioners and/or at least they should be given inspection thereof. The parties shall be given opportunity to inspect any document including the answer sheets etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 231: if an application, in that behalf is filed. Such inspection shall, however, be permitted to be made only in presence of an officer of the court. The Appellants shall be given two weeks time only for submitting their objections to such reports and their comments, if any, on any material whereupon the High Court places reliance from the date of supply of copies or inspection is given. Having regard to the fact that the appellants are out of job for a long time, we would request the High Court to consider the desirability disposing of the matter as expeditious as possible and preferably within the period of three months from the date of receipt of the copy of this order. Before parting with the case, however, we may observe that it is expected that the State having regard to the magnitude of the matter shall leave no stone unturned to bring the guilty to book. It is the duty of the State to unearth the scam and spare no officer howsoever high he may be. We expect the State to make a thorough investigation into the matter. These appeals are allowed to the aforementioned extent and with the directions and observations made hereinbefore.\n",
      "Paragraph 232: In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. \n"

      "Paragraphs:\n",
      "Paragraph 1:  1\\. Death and if not life, death or life, life and if not death, is the swinging progression of the criminal jurisprudence in India as far as capital punishment is concerned. The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, under Section 367(5) reads:\n",
      "Paragraph 2: If the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death, and the Court sentences him to any punishment other than death, the Court shall in its judgment state the reason why sentence of death was not passed. (Emphasis supplied) This provision making death the rule was omitted by Act 26 of 1955.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 2\\. There have been extensive discussions and studies on abolition of capital punishment during the first decade of our Constitution and the Parliament itself, at one stage had desired to have the views of the Law Commission of India and, accordingly, the Commission submitted a detailed report, Report No. 35 on 19.12.1967. A reference to the introduction to the 35th Report of the Law Commission will be relevant for our discussion. To quote:\n",
      "Paragraph 4: A resolution was moved in the Lok Sabha on 21st April, 1962, for the abolition of Capital Punishment. In the course of the debate on the resolution, suggestions were made that a commission or committee should be appointed to go into the question. However, ultimately, a copy of the discussion that had taken place in the House was forwarded to the Law Commission that was, at that time, seized of the question of examining the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Penal Code.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: The Law Commission considered it desirable to take up the subject separately from the revision of the general criminal law of the country. This was so, because of the importance of the subject, the voluminous nature of materials that were to be considered, and the large number of questions of detail that were to be examined. The matter had been repeatedly debated in Parliament in some form or other, and the Commission, therefore, thought its consideration to be somewhat urgent. In other countries also, the subject had been evidently treated as one for separate and full-fledged study.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 3\\. It appears that Parliament finally decided to retain capital punishment in the Indian Penal Code. However, when the new Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted in the year 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the Cr.PC), a paradigm shift was introduced, making it mandatory for Courts to state special reasons for awarding death sentence, under Section 354(3), which reads as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 7: When the conviction is for an offence punishable with death, or, in the alternative, with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years, the judgment shall state the reasons for the sentence awarded, and, in the case of sentence of death, the special reasons for such sentence. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 4\\. In the words of Krishna Iyer J. in [?CITATION?]:\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 20. The unmistakable shift in legislative emphasis is that life imprisonment for murder is the rule and capital sentence the exception to be resorted to for reasons to be stated. \n",
      "Paragraph 10: 21\\. It is obvious that the disturbed conscience of the State on the vexed question of legal threat to life by way of death sentence has sought to express itself legislatively, the stream of tendency being towards cautious, partial abolition and a retreat from total retention. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 5\\. It is interesting to note that the requirement for reasons to be stated for awarding any sentence for a term of years found legislative expression in the Cr.PC for the first time in 1973. In the case of death sentence, there must be special reasons. That shows the paradigm shift to life imprisonment as the rule and death, as the exception.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 6\\. The above preliminary discussion on death sentence has special significance as far as facts of the present case are concerned. The appellant before us faced trial under Section 302 read with Section 307 of IPC. The Sessions Court convicted him under both Sections. Under Section 302, he was sentenced to death and under Section 307, to life imprisonment. On reference, the High Court confirmed the death sentence.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: The appeal filed by the appellant before the High Court was dismissed confirming the conviction and sentence under Section 307\\. Thus aggrieved, the present appeals.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 7\\. In view of the overwhelming evidence, though the learned counsel appearing for the appellant was mainly canvassing for commuting the death sentence, in order to satisfy our conscience, we may refer to the facts, evidence and the contentions briefly, on merits as well.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: 8\\. The appellant was married to a woman named Sangita. They had three children, one daughter and two sons. They were staying in two rooms in a house belonging to his maternal aunt. He was a tailor by profession and employed as such in a cloth shop. One of his sons, Aakash had been suffering from asthma which required constant medication. The appellants income was hardly sufficient to maintain his family and he was under stress in that regard. On 08.07.2008, it is stated that during the early hours of the morning while the members of the family were sleeping, he assaulted his wife Sangita and his two sons with the separated parts of a pair of sharp scissors and inflicted multiple stab injuries causing their instantaneous death. On his daughter Gaitri alias Pooja also, he inflicted stab injuries. However, she somehow could speak and asked why her father, the appellant was injuring her. The appellant father told her that the entire family had to go and he would also follow them. However, he gave her water to drink. Thereafter, he took her on his lap and pressed her mouth with a pillow with the intention of suffocating her, and yet the child did not succumb to death. He left the child in that condition, bolted the door from outside and went straight to the police station and reported the incident. An FIR was registered. His statement was recorded. In the meanwhile, the daughter Gaitri got assistance from a neighbour and was immediately treated at a hospital and thus she survived. She is the key witness-PW1. The neighbour is the maternal aunt of the accused and she is PW4.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 9\\. The prosecution examined nine witnesses and based mainly on the version of PW1-Gaitri, the appellant was convicted under Sections 302 and 307.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: Gaitri alias Pooja was clear and consistent during the investigation as well as before the Sessions Court. In her evidence before the Court, she stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 18:  My father, mother and all we children were in the house. My father assaulted my mother, my two brothers and me with the help of scissor.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: My two brothers and mother died on the spot. I was assaulted over my chest and abdomen and to my both hands. I asked my father as to why he was assaulting us although we did nothing. My father told me that all of us need to go and he would be following us. Then my father gave me water to drink. He then took me on his laps and then pressed my mouth with the help of pillow. He then went to Police Station. While going out he bolted the door from outside. One Sakharbai Sadashiv Sonwane was staying in the same house in their neighbourhood. I shouted for help. I told her to save us and that we were bleeding. She then opened the door. Then my uncle Anil Gaikwad came there and we were taken to Govt. Hospital at Gevrai for treatment. From there I was brought to Beed in the Civil Hospital by my uncle. Police came to me for making inquiry in the Hospital. I narrated the whole incident to them. The accused in the dock is my father. The accused was a tailor and he was working in somebodys shop owned by one Anil. I can identify the scissor shown to me today. (Witness identified Article No. 15 the scissor in the Court). I was in the Hospital for about 21 days. (Emphasis supplied) In cross, she stated thus:\n",
      "Paragraph 20:  We are financially poor. My father used to work in the shop for whole day and even for late nights during festival season. It is true that sometimes he remained in the shop for whole night and return back in the next day. He used to earn money by working in the shop for us.\n",
      "Paragraph 21:  It is not true to say that I am not able to tell who killed my mother and brothers as I was in sleep.  It is not true that I am deposing false that my father assaulted us.  It is not true to say that I am deposing against the accused only on the say of my uncle and the Police. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 10\\. PW2 is the panch witness. PW3 is the doctor - Dr. Kranti Raut, who performed the autopsy. In the case of all the three deceased, the doctor has given the opinion that the death was caused due to hemorrhagic shock with heamothorax on account of multiple stab injuries to the vital organs. FSL report has confirmed that the blood on the clothes of the appellant and that of his deceased wife was of the same group. The doctor has also treated PW1 Gaitri alias Pooja and has referred in detail to the multiple injuries inflicted upon her. It is also deposed that injury no.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: 4-which is a stab wound is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature if timely treatment is not given. The doctor stated that all the injuries to the deceased persons as well as to the injured PW1- Gaitri are possible by the weapon-Article No. 6, scissors. PW4-Sakharbai is the aunt of the appellant. She has stated that the elder son of the appellant was suffering from asthma. She also deposed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 24:  When I was sleeping in my house I got at about 5.30 a.m. I was washing utensils. I heard a sound from Gaitri asking me to open the door and that her father had assaulted them. I went near the room and found that the door was bolted from outside which I opened and went inside the room. I saw Sangita, Omkar, Aakash were lying in a pool of blood and they were dead. Gaitri had also bleeding injuries to her chest, stomach and chin. She told me that her father assaulted all of them with a scissor in that night. I shouted and went to Baban, Anil and called them. The said Anil took Gaitri to Hospital. Gaitri is also known by name Pooja. .. (Emphasis supplied) In cross, she submitted that the accused was a tailor. It is true that his financial condition was poor.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: 11\\. PW5 is the one who sold the scissors to the appellant. PW6 is the panch witness to the recovery of weapon of offence and other dress worn by the accused. PW7 is the Police Sub-Inspector. According to him, the appellant had told him at around 5.30 a.m. that he had committed the murder of his wife and two sons and had injured his daughter Gaitri. The statement- Exhibit No.29 was recorded by him and appellant signed the same. PW8 is the Police Inspector who conducted the investigation. PW9 is the Police Inspector who prepared the inquest and spot panchnama. He collected the blood from the spot and the pillow cover soaked in blood. He also made the recovery of the scissors as disclosed by the accused. Photographs were also taken. We may also refer to the statement made by the appellant himself before the police on the basis of which the FIR was registered:\n",
      "Paragraph 26:  In my family my son Omkar is constantly ill due to asthma. For the treatment of his ailment money was required which I had to borrow and hence I had become debt ridden. Due to the tension I could not concentrate on my work and I had to go on leave frequently. Since I was fed up, I decided to leave the house, my wife and children would have died of hunger and ailment. Therefore, I had thought to relieve them myself. (Emphasis supplied) Then he has narrated the manner in which he killed his wife and two sons.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: As far as assault on the daughter is concerned, he stated as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 28:  Thereafter I dealt 2-3 blows on chest of my daughter due to which she woke up and having seen me dealing blows she asked weepingly earnestly papa why did you do so. At that time I replied we all have to go, I am also coming. By saying so, I gave her water to drink and took her head on my lap. In order to kill her I pressed her mouth and nose but she was not dying. I waited for some time. Due to the incident which had happened I was terrified. Then I kept water near her and left her in injured condition. Thereafter I removed my clothes worn by me at the time of commission of the crime. I wrapped the scissors used for the crime in a cloth and went to the police station and presented myself and informed the incident. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 12\\. Under Section 313 statement, however, he flatly denied everything but did not lead any evidence in defence.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: 13\\. The Sessions Court and the High Court have discussed in detail the conduct of the appellant. The courts have also considered his main contention that he was not involved in the incident. Both the Courts have found that it was not at all possible to appreciate his contentions since the normal conduct of a father in such circumstances would be first to help the child to obtain treatment either by himself or with the assistance of those residing in the neighbouring rooms and nearby.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: Suffice it to say that the evidence available on record, some of which we have referred to above, would establish beyond doubt that accused alone was involved in the commission of the offences.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 14\\. We shall, hence, consider the question of sentence. The Sessions Court and the High Court are of the view that the case falls under the rarest of the rare category and the appellant did not deserve any mercy.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 15\\. Before awarding a sentence of death, in view of Section 354(3) of the Cr.PC, the court has to first examine whether it is a case fit for awarding of life sentence and if not and only then, the death sentence can be awarded. At the risk of redundancy, we may note that the rule is life imprisonment for murder, and death is the exception for which special reasons are to be stated.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: 16\\. The death sentence has been relegated to the rarest of rare cases after the landmark decision of the Constitution Bench in [?CITATION?]. The most significant aspect of the decision in Bachan Singhs case (supra) is the mandate laid down by the Constitution Bench that Courts must not only look at the crime but also the offender and give due consideration to the circumstances of the offender at the time of commission of the crime. This decision rules the field even today and no discussion on the subject of death penalty is complete without a reference to Bachan Singhs case (supra). To quote:\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 201.  As we read Sections 354(3) and 235(2) and other related provisions of the Code of 1973, it is quite clear to us that for making the choice of punishment or for ascertaining the existence or absence of special reasons in that context, the court must pay due regard both to the crime and the criminal. What is the relative weight to be given to the aggravating and mitigating factors, depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. More often than not, these two aspects are so intertwined that it is difficult to give a separate treatment to each of them. This is so because style is the man. In many cases, the extremely cruel or beastly manner of the commission of murder is itself a demonstrated index of the depraved character of the perpetrator. That is why, it is not desirable to consider the circumstances of the crime and the circumstances of the criminal in two separate watertight compartments. In a sense, to kill is to be cruel and, therefore, all murders are cruel. But such cruelty may vary in its degree of culpability. And it is only when the culpability assumes the proportion of extreme depravity that special reasons can legitimately be said to exist.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: xxx xxx xxx 209\\. There are numerous other circumstances justifying the passing of the lighter sentence; as there are countervailing circumstances of aggravation. We cannot obviously feed into a judicial computer all such situations since they are astrological imponderables in an imperfect and undulating society. Nonetheless, it cannot be over- emphasized that the scope and concept of mitigating factors in the area of death penalty must receive a liberal and expansive construction by the courts in accord with the sentencing policy writ large in Section 354(3). Judges should never be bloodthirsty. Hanging of murderers has never been too good for them. Facts and figures, albeit incomplete, furnished by the Union of India, show that in the past, Courts have inflicted the extreme penalty with extreme infrequency  a fact which attests to the caution and compassion which they have always brought to bear on the exercise of their sentencing discretion in so grave a matter. It is, therefore, imperative to voice the concern that courts, aided by the broad illustrative guide-lines indicated by us, will discharge the onerous function with evermore scrupulous care and humane concern, directed along the highroad of legislative policy outlined in Section 354(3), viz., that for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception. A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through laws instrumentality.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: That ought not to be done save in the rarest of rare cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 17\\. The three-Judge Bench decision in [?CITATION?] culled out the guidelines indicated in Bachan Singhs case (supra), which would be required to be applied to the facts of each case while imposing a sentence of death. Emphasis was laid in the decision in Machhi Singhs case (supra) on drawing a balance sheet of mitigating and aggravating factors. To quote:\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 38. xxx xxx xxx i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the crime.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: iv) A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 39\\. In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following questions may be asked and answered:\n",
      "Paragraph 44: (a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence? (b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender?\"\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 40\\. If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances in the light of the aforesaid proposition and taking into account the answers to the questions posed hereinabove, the circumstances of the case are such that death sentence is warranted, the court would proceed to do so. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 18\\. When there are binding decisions, judicial comity expects and requires the same to be followed. Judicial comity is an integral part of judicial discipline and judicial discipline the cornerstone of judicial integrity.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: No doubt, in case there are newer dimensions not in conflict with the ratio of larger bench decisions or where there is anything to be added to and explained, it is always permissible to introduce the same. Poverty, socio- economic, psychic compulsions, undeserved adversities in life are thus some of the mitigating factors to be considered, in addition to those indicated in Bachan Singh and Machhi Singh cases. Thus, we are bound to analyze the facts in the light of the aggravating and mitigating factors indicated in the binding decisions which have influenced the commission of the crime, the criminal, and his circumstances, while considering the sentence.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 19\\. In a recent decision in [?CITATION?], this Court has scanned almost all the post Bachan Singh (supra) decisions rendered by this Court on death sentence and the principles laid down therein have been restated. Referring to the recent decisions (fifteen years), the principal reasons considered as aggravating factors for conferring death penalty have been summarized with reference to the decisions in support of the same. To quote paragraph 122 of Shankar Kisanraos case (supra):\n",
      "Paragraph 49: 122. The principal reasons for confirming the death penalty in the above cases include:\n",
      "Paragraph 50: (1) the cruel, diabolic, brutal, depraved and gruesome nature of the crime ([?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?],[?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]);\n",
      "Paragraph 51: (2) the crime results in public abhorrence, shocks the judicial conscience or the conscience of society or the community (Dhananjoy Chatterjee (supra), Jai Kumar (supra), Ankush Maruti Shinde (supra) and Mohd. Mannan (supra));\n",
      "Paragraph 52: (3) the reform or rehabilitation of the convict is not likely or that he would be a menace to society (Jai Kumar (supra), B.A. Umesh (supra) and Mohd. Mannan (supra));\n",
      "Paragraph 53: (4) the victims were defenseless (Dhananjoy Chatterjee (supra), Laxman Naik (supra), Kamta Tewari (supra), Ankush Maruti Shinde (supra), Mohd. Mannan (supra) and Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik (supra));\n",
      "Paragraph 54: (5) the crime was either unprovoked or that it was premeditated (Dhananjoy Chatterjee (supra), Laxman Naik (supra), Kamta Tewari (supra), Nirmal Singh (supra), Jai Kumar (supra), Ankush Maruti Shinde (supra), B.A. Umesh (supra) and Mohd. Mannan (supra)) and in three cases the antecedents or the prior history of the convict was taken into consideration ([?CITATION?], B.A. Umesh (supra) and Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik (supra)). (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 55: 20\\. The mitigating factors governing the award of life sentence in a murder case, have been summarized at paragraph 106. To quote:\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 106. A study of the above cases suggests that there are several reasons, cumulatively taken, for converting the death penalty to that of imprisonment for life. However, some of the factors that have had an influence in commutation include:\n",
      "Paragraph 57: (1) the young age of the accused [[?CITATION?] aged 20 years, [?CITATION?] aged 24 years, [?CITATION?] aged 24 years, [?CITATION?] aged 28 years and [?CITATION?] aged 28 years];\n",
      "Paragraph 58: (2) the possibility of reforming and rehabilitating the accused (in Santosh Kumar Singh (supra) and Amit v. State of U.P. (supra) the accused, incidentally, were young when they committed the crime);\n",
      "Paragraph 59: (3) the accused had no prior criminal record (Nirmal Singh (supra), [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], Rahul (supra) and Amit v. State of U.P.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: (supra));\n",
      "Paragraph 61: (4) the accused was not likely to be a menace or threat or danger to society or the community (Nirmal Singh (supra), Mohd. [?CITATION?], Raju (supra), Bantu (supra), Surendra Pal Shivbalakpal (supra), Rahul (supra) and Amit v. State of U.P. (supra));\n",
      "Paragraph 62: (5) a few other reasons need to be mentioned such as the accused having been acquitted by one of the courts ([?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]);\n",
      "Paragraph 63: (6) the crime was not premeditated ([?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]);\n",
      "Paragraph 64: (7) the case was one of circumstantial evidence ([?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 65: In one case, commutation was ordered since there was apparently no exceptional feature warranting a death penalty (Kumudi Lal (supra)) and in another case because the Trial Court had awarded life sentence but the High Court enhanced it to death ([?CITATION?]). (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 21\\. At this juncture, it might be useful to refer also to the decision in Ediga Anammas case (supra). In that case, this Court has held that where the offender suffers from socio-economic, psychic or penal compulsions insufficient to attract a legal exception or to downgrade the crime into a lesser one, judicial commutation is permissible. To quote:\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 26. ...Where the offender suffers from socio-economic, psychic or penal compulsions insufficient to attract a legal exception or to downgrade the crime into a lesser one, judicial commutation is permissible. Other general social pressures, warranting judicial notice, with an extenuating impact may, in special cases, induce the lesser penalty. Extraordinary features in the judicial process, such as that the death sentence has hung over the head of the culprit excruciatingly long, may persuade the court to be compassionate.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: Likewise, if others involved in the crime and similarly situated have received the benefit of life imprisonment or if the offence is only constructive, being under Section 302 read with Section 149, or again the accused has acted suddenly under another's instigation, without premeditation, perhaps the court may humanely opt for life, even like where a just cause or real suspicion of wifely infidelity pushed the criminal into the crime.  (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 22\\. Ediga Anammas case (supra) was given the stamp of approval in a subsequent decision by a three-Judge Bench in [?CITATION?] holding also that undeserved adversities of childhood or later would also be a mitigating factor.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: 23\\. This Court in Ediga Anammas case (supra) has referred to a few other aggravating factors as well. To quote:\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 26.  On the other hand, the weapons used and the manner of their use, the horrendous features of the crime and hapless, helpless state of the victim, and the like, steal the heart of the law for a sterner sentence. We cannot obviously feed into a judicial computer all such situations since they are astrological imponderables in an imperfect and undulating society. A legal policy on life or death cannot be left for ad hoc mood or individual predilection and so we have sought to objectify to the extent possible, abandoning retributive ruthlessness, amending the deterrent creed and accenting the trend against the extreme and irrevocable penalty of putting out life. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 72: 24\\. Socio-economic compulsions such as poverty are also factors that are to be considered by Courts while awarding a sentence. This view has been taken in the decision in [?CITATION?] where this Court refrained from awarding the death sentence because of the extreme poverty of the accused. The facts in the case of Sushil Kumar (supra) are very similar to the present case. In that case also, the accused had committed the murder of his wife and two young children due to extreme poverty. Later, he allegedly attempted to take his own life by consuming some tablets. The accused had been sentenced to death by the trial court and the sentence was confirmed by the High Court. This Court, while reducing the sentence to life imprisonment observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 73: 46. Extreme poverty had driven the appellant to commit the gruesome murder of three of his very near and dear family members - his wife, minor son and daughter. There is nothing on record to show that appellant is a habitual offender. He appears to be a peace-loving, law abiding citizen but as he was poverty-stricken, he thought in his wisdom to completely eliminate him family so that all problems would come to an end. Precisely, this appears to be the reason for him to consume some poisonous substances, after committing the offence of murder.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: 47\\. No witness has complained about the appellants bad or intolerable behaviour in the past. Many people had visited his house after the incident is indicative of the fact that he had cordial relations with all. He is now about thirty-five years of age and there appear to be fairly good chances of the appellant getting reformed and becoming a good citizen. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 25\\. In the case before us, it has come in evidence that the appellant suffered from economic and psychic compulsions. The possibility of reforming and rehabilitating the accused cannot be ruled out. The accused had no prior criminal record. On the facts available to the Court, it can be safely said that the accused is not likely to be menace or threat or danger to society. There is nothing to show that he had any previous criminal background. The appellant had in fact intended to wipe out the whole family including himself on account of abject poverty. This aspect of the matter has not been properly appreciated by both the Sessions Court and the High Court which held that the appellant had the intention to only wipe out others and had not even attempted, and he was not prepared either, for suicide. We are afraid the Courts have not appreciated the evidence properly. Had his daughter not interrupted him asking the question why he was killing her, his intended conduct would have followed, as is evident from his response that all of them needed to go from the world. The crucial and turning point of the change of heart is the conversation she had with him. It is significant to note that he had not permitted, in the way he executed the murder of his wife and two sons to let them even scream, let alone ask any question. It so happened by chance that despite the stab injuries inflicted on the daughter, she managed to weepingly question her father why he was acting in such a manner. The change of heart is also discernible from the fact that he had given water to the injured daughter. After this, he no longer used the weapon for finishing her. He tried once again by taking her to his lap and stifling her with the aid of a pillow. However, as can be seen from his own statement, he could not finish killing her. Thereafter, he went straight to the police station and gave a statement of what he had done.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 26\\. If we analyse the facts of the case in the backdrop of the circumstances of the appellant at the time of commission of the offence and on applying the crime test and the criminal test, it is fairly clear that the case does not fall under the rarest of rare category of cases so as to warrant a punishment of death. The individually inconclusive and cumulatively marginal facts and circumstances tend towards awarding lesser sentence of life imprisonment.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 27\\. In the above facts and circumstances of the case, while upholding the conviction of the appellant under Section 302 and Section 307 of IPC, we modify the sentence as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 78: a) For offence under Section 302 of IPC, the appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: b) For offence under Section 307 of IPC, the appellant is convicted to imprisonment for a period of seven years.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 28\\. Imprisonment for life of a convict is till the end of his biological life as held by the Constitution Bench in [?CITATION?]. Hence, there is no point in saying that the sentences would run consecutively. However, we make it clear that in case the sentence of imprisonment for life is remitted or commuted to any specified period (in any case, not less than fourteen years in view of Section 433A of the Cr.PC.), the sentence of imprisonment under Section 307 of IPC shall commence thereafter.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: 29\\. The appeals are allowed as above.\n"

      "Paragraph 1: These appeals by special leave are directed against the common judgment and order of the Gauhati High Court dated 21st July, 2003 in Writ Petition (C) No. 6541 of 2001 [WP (C) No.221(SH)/2002] and Writ Petition (C) No. 6542 of 2001 [WP (C) No.222(SH)/2002] whereby the High Court dismissed the writ petitions filed by the appellants herein.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: Appellant Ewanlangki-e Rymbai, a Christian by faith is a Member of the Jaintia Scheduled Tribe. The other appellant, namely  Elaka Jowai Secular Movement is represented by its Vice Chairman and Executive Member. In both the writ petitions the constitutional validity of Section 3 of the United Khasi Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and Headmen) Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1959') has been challenged. The writ petitions also challenged the notice dated August 28, 2001 issued by the Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council, Jowai declaring the programme for the election of Dolloi in the Elaka Jowai and also the notice dated September 4, 2001 issued by the Secretary, Executive Committee, Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council, Jowai.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Section 3 of the Act of 1959 provides that subject to the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder all elections and appointments of Chiefs and Headmen shall be in accordance with the existing customs prevailing in the Elaka concerned. The notice dated September 4, 2001 announced the programme for the conduct of election for Dolloi in the Elaka Jowai but the notice issued by the Secretary on behalf of the Executive Committee, Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council, Jowai provided that only the members of the clans mentioned therein could contest the aforesaid election and thereby the persons belonging to the Christian faith were excluded from contesting the said election. The appellants contend that exclusion of Christians from contesting the election is in violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India since they are excluded only on the ground of religion. They further contend that Section 3 of the Act of 1959 which provided that the appointment of the Chiefs or Headmen shall be in accordance with the existing customs prevailing in the Elaka concerned, is also bad. It gives legal sanctity to a customs which itself is in breach of Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India. In sum and sub stance the appellants contend that exclusion of Christians from contesting election for the post of Dolloi in Elaka Jowai is discriminatory and in breach of Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India since their exclusion is merely on the ground of religion.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: We may notice at the threshold that Jowai District is an autonomous District to which the provisions of Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India apply in view of the provisions of Article 244(2) of the Constitution of India. The brief historical background in which the aforesaid autonomous district was created may be noticed at this stage :- On coming into force of the Constitution of India the United Khasi- Jaintia Hills District was formed as one of the Tribal Areas of Assam by merging the Khasi States with the other areas of the Khasi-Jaintia Hills, boundaries whereof were defined by para 20(2) of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution (hereinafter referred to as 'the Schedule'). Under para 2(4) of the Schedule, the administration of the aforesaid district vested in the District Council which was clothed with administrative and judicial powers.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: In view of the demand for creation of an autonomous District comprising the Jowai sub-division of the aforesaid District, the Governor of Assam appointed a Commission to look into the matter and make its recommendation. The report of the Commission was placed before the Legislative Assembly which approved the action proposed to be taken pursuant to the report. Consequently on November 23, 1964 a Notification was issued by the Governor of Assam creating a new autonomous District Council for the Jowai Sub-Division by excluding Jowai Sub-division from the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills Autonomous District with effect from December 1, 1964. Thus the Jowai District came into existence as an autonomous District with effect from December 1, 1964.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: As earlier noticed Article 244(2) of the Constitution provides that the provision of the Sixth Schedule shall be applied to the administration of the tribal areas in the State of Assam. The tribal areas in Assam are governed not by the relevant provisions of the Constitution which apply to the other Constituent States of the Union of India but by the provisions contained in the Sixth Schedule. These provisions purport to provide for a self-contained code for the governance of the tribal areas forming part of Assam and they deal with all the relevant topics in that behalf. (See : [?CITATION?])\n",
      "Paragraph 7: Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule provides for the formation of an autonomous district and further provides that if there are different scheduled tribes in an autonomous district, the Governor may by public notification divide the area or areas inhabited by them into autonomous regions.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: Paragraph 2 provides for the constitution of a District Council for each autonomous district. Similarly for each autonomous region a separate Regional Council is provided. The administration of an autonomous district insofar as it is not vested under the Schedule in any Regional Council within such district, is vested in the District Council for such district. The administration of an autonomous region is vested in the Regional Council for such region. Sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 2 empowers the Governor to make Rules for the first constitution of District Councils and Regional Councils in consultation with the existing tribal Councils or other representative tribal organizations within the autonomous districts or regions concerned. Paragraphs 3 to 17 make provision for the administration of the autonomous Districts and the Regions. Paragraph 3 in particular provides that the District Council for an autonomous district in respect of all areas within the district except those which are under the authority of Regional Councils, if any, shall have power to make laws with respect to the matters enumerated therein which provide inter alia  \"for the appointment or succession of Chiefs or Headmen\". The laws made under this paragraph are required to be submitted forthwith to the Governor and, until assented to by him, shall have no effect.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: In exercise of powers conferred upon him by sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 2, the Governor framed rules called \"the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951\". The Rules provide, inter alia, for the constitution of an Executive Committee consisting of the Chief Executive Members as the head and two other members to exercise the executive functions of the District Council.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: After the coming into the existence of Jowai District as an autonomous District the Jowai Autonomous District Act, 1967 was enacted.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: The provisions of this Act were made applicable to the Jowai Autonomous District and the Rules of 1951, as amended from time to time, were made applicable. The Act, Rules and Regulations framed under the United Khasi- Jaintia Hills District Council as listed in Appendix  I were also made applicable to the Jowai Autonomous District till such time the Jowai Autonomous District Council made its own laws. Appendix  I includes the United Khasi Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and Headmen) Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1959 Act') which was made applicable to the Jowai District Council.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: Section 2 (a), (b) and (g) of the 1959 Act are as follows :- \"2. Definition.  In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, the following expressions shall have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say :- (a) \"Chief\" means a Sylem, a Lyngdoh, a Dolloi, a Sirdar or a Wahadadar as the case may be, of any Elaka.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: (b) \"Custom\" with reference to any Elaka means any rule regarding the appointment of a Chief or Headman for that Elaka which having been continuously and uniformly observed for a long time, has obtained the force of law in that Elaka.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: . . .\n",
      "Paragraph 15: (g) \"Elaka\" means any administrative unit in the District specified in Appendixes I, II and III or any other administrative unit to be constituted and declared as such by the Executive Committee.\" Section 3 reads as follows :- \"3. Elections and Appointment of Chiefs and Headmen. - Subject to the provision of this Act and the Rules made thereunder all elections and appointments of Chiefs or Headmen shall be in accordance with the existing customs prevailing in the Elaka concerned.\" All appointments of Chiefs are made subject to the approval of the District Council which may confirm such appointments under terms and conditions which it may by Rules, from time to time, adopt.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: Under Appendix  III Jowai has been specified as an Elaka, headed by a Chief who would be a Dolloi. Apart from challenging the constitutional validity of Section 3 of the Act of 1959, appellants also challenge the validity of the notice issued by the Secretary of Executive Committee of Jowai District dated September 4, 2001 which is reproduced below :- \"OFFICE OF THE JAINTIA HILLS AUTONOMOUS DISTRICT COUNCIL, JOWAI NOTICE DATED JOWAI, THE 4TH SEPT. 2001 This is Public Notice that the Executive Committee, Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council, Jowai after thorough investigation and scrutinisation has decided that the following Clans has the right to stand for the election of the Dolloiship in the Elaka Jowsai :\n",

      "Paragraph 28: Sd/- E.M . Lyngdoh Secretary, Executive Committee Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council, Jowai\" It is not disputed before us that Dolloi performs Administrative as well as religious functions and a Christian cannot perform the religious functions which are performed by Dolloi. However, the appellants have impunged Section 3 of the Act of 1959 and the notifications issued on the following grounds:- i) The Notification issued is a law within the meaning of Article 13 (3) (a) of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: ii) Being a law preventing a person belonging to a particular religion from contesting election to a public post is violative of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India, and therefore, void.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: iii) Section 3 which provides for the Election and Appointment of Dolloi in accordance with custom is void since the customs itself clearly discriminates on the ground of religion. A custom must give way to fundamental right and any custom which offends the fundamental rights of a citizen must be held to be invalid.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: On the other hand learned counsel appearing for the respondents submitted that there is no violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India since reasonable classification is permissible in law and the exclusion of Christians from contesting the election is not only on the ground of religion, but on the ground that they are unable to perform religious functions of the office of Dolloi. It is further submitted that indeed the provisions only serve to conserve the tribal culture which itself is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 29 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: In substance, the impugned law and the notifications do not incur the wrath of Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution, on the contrary, they enjoy the protection of Article 29 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: On a consideration of the material placed before it the High Court came to the conclusion that a custom prevailed in the Elaka Jowai which on account of its long practice and by common consent acquired the status of a governing rule for election and appointment of Dolloi to perform both administrative and religious functions. The fact that the Dolloi in Elaka Jowai is required to perform both administrative and the religious functions as prevalent by custom is not disputed. What was submitted on behalf of the appellants was that 2 persons could be called upon to perform those duties, one performing the administrative duties and the other the religious functions. Only 2 instances were cited when Christians were appointed as Dolloi of Elaka Jowai. In the year 1890 an attempt was made to install a person who had converted himself into Chiristianity as Dolloi of Elaka Jowai, but he had to face the wrath of the people in performing the religious functions and ultimately had to resign from the post. In the other case the Dolloi had to be removed by issuance of an order of termination. The High Court found that since time immemorial the custom is to appoint one Dolloi who has to perform both administrative as well as religious functions.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: Moreover under the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and Headmen) Act, 1959 (Act No.11 of 1959) \"service land\" and \"puja land\" were given to Dolloi who was appointed as the \"Chief\". \"Service land\" which was revenue free land was held and cultivated by the Chief or the Headman in lieu of monetary remuneration for services rendered. \"Puja land\" was revenue free land held and cultivated by him and the income yielded therefrom utilized by him in meeting expenses connected with the religious performances according to customs of the Elaka. The High Court, therefore, recorded a finding that there was a custom prevalent for a long period which was invariably practiced to the effect that the \"Chief\", namely the Dolloi must perform administrative as well as religious duties. There was no customs to appoint two Dollois  one for the performance of administrative duties and the other for the performance of religious functions. Deviation for a short period on account of existing emergency which needed immediate correction did not derogate from its character as a custom. The High Court concluded thus :- \"On reading Section 3 read with Section 2(j) and 2(k) of the Act, 1959 and on the pleadings of the parties we hold that the Dolloi elected and appointed in Elaka Jowai was required to perform the executive function as well as religious functions which is a custom prevalent in the Elaka. We further hold that there cannot be two Dollois one performing the administrative functions and the other performing the religious functions.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: Under the Act, 1959 there can be only one Dolloi performing both administrative as well as religious functions\".\n",
      "Paragraph 36: An argument was advanced before the High Court, which was not advanced before us, that the notice issued on September 4, 2001 by the Secretary, Executive Committee, of the Jowai Autonomous District Council was without jurisdiction and authority. The High Court negatived the contention and held that the Executive Committee in exercise of its delegated powers can issue such a public notice for appointment by election of Dolloiship in Elaka Jowai in the absence of rules, regulations or enactments providing for such election and appointment. Reliance was placed on a judgment of this Court in [?CITATION?]. However, the High Court held that any law/regulation/rule/notification made or action taken under the Sixth Schedule by the District Council or the Executive Committee formed by the District Council must not in any manner commit a breach of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: The High Court then proceeded to consider the submission urged before it that the exclusion of Christians from contesting election to the post of Dolloi violated Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. In doing so the High Court also noticed Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India and ultimately concluded that there was no breach of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India and in fact it protected the rights guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: The appellants in these appeals have challenged the correctness of the decision of the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: Shri P.K. Goswami, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the District Council (respondents 1 to 3) submitted that the High Court was right in holding that having regard to the facts of the case and the nature of the office of Dolloi, the notice excluding Christians from contesting for the post of Dolloi was fully justified. Dolloi performs administrative as well as religious functions. Such a custom and such an office existed since time immemorial and acquired the status of well preserved custom. It, therefore, became the duty of the State to ensure the right guaranteed under Article 26 of the Constitution of India. This was not really a case to which Articles 15 and 16 were applicable, but even assuming that to be so, there was no discrimination since the exclusion of Christians was not only on the ground of religion, but on the ground that they could not perform the religious functions of the office which by custom a Dolli was required to perform. It is submitted that under Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India reasonable classification was permissible. In particular he drew our attention to Article 26(b) of the Constitution of India and submitted that since the office of Dolloi involves the performance of both the administrative as well as religious duties, the concerned tribes had a right to manage their own affairs in matter of religion. He relied upon authorities in support of his submission that the right of the tribes to have a Dolloi who could perform administrative as well as religious functions was a right guaranteed under Article 26 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: Mr. R.F. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondents 5 and 6 analysed the provisions of Articles 14, 15, 16, 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution of India and submitted that Article 14 permitted reasonable classification in accordance with well settled principles. Article 15 was a species of Article 14 inasmuch it prohibited the State from discriminating against any citizen on the ground only of religion, race, caste, sex place of birth or any of them. However, he emphasized the use of the words \"on ground only of religion\". Thus if a citizen is discriminated against \"on ground only of religion\", such action may be unconstitutional.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: That however, is not the case here. The exclusion is on account of the admitted fact that a Christian cannot perform the religious duties of a Dolloi.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment but clause (5) thereof expressly provides that nothing in the article shall affect the operation of any law which provides that the incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any religious or denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination. He submitted that the right guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution was subject to other provisions of Part III of the Constitution of India but so far as Article 26 was concerned, it was only subject to public order, morality and health. So far as Article 29 is concerned it is a absolute right guaranteed for the conservation of a language, script or culture. He submitted that the rights protected are those guaranteed under Article 26(b) and 29(1) of the Constitution. He, therefore, submitted that election of a tribal head with all concomitants thereof was part of the tribal culture. The Constitution guarantees uniformity in diversity. The cultural rights under Article 29 of the Constitution of India are couched in the widest language unlike under Articles 25 and 26, which are subject to certain limitations. Having regard to the nature of duties to be performed by a Dolloi the person elected as Dolloi must be religiously proficient to perform his religious duties. It was really with a view to preserve their culture that a Christian was excluded from contesting the office of Dolloi which involved performance of religious duties, which he could not perform. It was a core aspect of the tribal culture that Dolloi must perform administrative functions as well as religious functions which involve performance of religious ceremonies which the High Court has elaborated in great detail. According to him, Articles 14 to 16 were not at all breached and in the ultimate analysis the right guaranteed under Article 29 must prevail since it is the mandate of Article 29 that such cultural rights must be preserved. There is force in the submissions advanced on behalf of the respondents.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: Article 14 ensures equality before law, which means that only persons who are in like circumstances should be treated equally. To treat equally those who are not equal would itself be violative of Article 14 which embodies a rule against arbitrariness. Thus classification is permissible if it satisfies the twin test of its being founded on intelligible differentia, which in turn has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: Article 15 prohibits the State from discriminating against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: This, however, is subject to the exception carved out by clauses 3 and 4 which permit special provisions to be made in favour of women and children, and for socially and educationally backward classes of citizens i.e.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These are exceptions to the rule embodied in clauses (1) and (2) of Article 15.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: Article 16 also embodies the rule against discrimination, but is limited in its scope than Article 15, since it is confined to office or employment under the State, whereas Article 15 covers the entire range of State activities.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: Descent and residence are the two additional grounds on which discrimination is not permissible under Article 16. But the rule is again subject to the exceptions carved out by clauses 3 to 5 thereof. Clause 5 is relevant for our purpose, and it provides as under :- \"(5) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any law which provides that the incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any religious or denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination.\" Thus Article 14 lays down the rule of equality in the widest term, while Article 15 prohibit discrimination on grounds specified therein but covering the entire range of State activities. Article 16 embodies the same rule but is narrower in its scope since it is confined to State activities relating to office or employment under the State. Both Articles 15 and 16 operate subject to exceptions therein. It has been so laid down by this Court in[?CITATION?] and in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 49: Counsel for the appellants submitted that prohibition against contesting for the post of Dolloi on the ground of religion ex-facie amounted to discrimination on the ground of religion. On the contrary the respondents contend that the exclusion is not on the ground of religion alone, and therefore, does not invite the wrath of Articles 15 and 16. The exclusion is justified on the ground that those who cannot perform the dual nature of functions of the Dolloi, namely administrative and religious  cannot be eligible for the post. The exclusion, therefore, is neither arbitrary nor irrational. It is axiomatic that one who cannot perform the duties attached to the office must be held to be ineligible to hold the office. His exclusion, therefore, cannot be considered as either unreasonable or arbitrary or discriminatory.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: The submission urged on behalf of the respondents must be accepted.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: We have earlier noticed the findings of the High Court to the effect that it is the tribal custom of the Elaka that the Dolloi of the Elaka Jowai must perform both the administrative and religious functions of his office. The High Court has exhaustively considered the evidence on record and considered the various rituals and observances, practices, poojas, ceremonies, customary religious functions which are regarded as integral part of religious customs, and which the Dolloi must perform in the discharge of his duties as the Dolloi. Such rituals, observances, ceremonies etc. are many in number. The material on record leaves no room for doubt that the office of Dolloi with its dual functions, administrative and religious, is a part of the tribal religion and culture, governed by custom since time immemorial. It logically follows that the Dolloi must be one who is conversant with the indigenous religious practices of the inhabitants of the Elaka. He must be one who should be able to lead the people of the Elaka in the religious ceremonies according to their custom, and must also be competent to perform the rituals, practices, poojas, ceremonies etc. which he is required to perform as a duty attached to his office. It is not disputed that a Christian cannot perform the indigenous religious functions which a Dolloi is required to perform, apart from his administrative functions. By long standing custom, the Dolloi must perform both administrative and religious functions, and such duties cannot be bifurcated by appointing one other to perform the religious functions only. There is no such custom prevalent in the Elaka. In its long history, such a thing happened only twice, and on both occasions there was a public outcry resulting in dismissal of the Dolloi in one case and his resignation in the other. The custom cannot be said to be discontinued or destroyed by such aberrations. The High Court has also noticed the judicial recognition given to the customary practice in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills that a Dolloi cannot be a Christian.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: Having regard to all these facts, we are in agreement with the High Court that by excluding Christians from contesting the post of Dolloi, Articles 14, 15 and 16 are not violated. The exclusion is justified by goond reason, since admittedly the religious duties of a Dolloi of Elaka Jowai cannot be performed by a Christian. Thus the ground for exclusion of Christians is not solely the ground of religion, but on account of the admitted fact that a Christian cannot perform the religious functions attached to the office of Dolloi. The reason cannot be said to be either unreasonable or arbitrary.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: Counsel for the appellants relied upon the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?], wherein this Court considered the challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 118 of the Succession Act, 1925. The aforesaid provision was struck down by this Court on the ground of arbitrariness violating Article 14 of the Constitution. It found that even the classification of the Christians as a class by themselves was neither based on any intelligible differentia nor had any nexus with the object sought to be achieved. It was, therefore, held to be discriminatory as also arbitrary. But the challenge based on Article 15 of the Constitution was repelled in the following words :- \" So far as the second argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is concerned, it is suffice to say that Article 15 of the Constitution of India may not have any application in the instant case as the discrimination forbidden thereby is only such discrimination as is based, inter alia, on the ground that a person belongs to a particular religion. The said right conferred by clause (1) of Article 15 being only on a \"citizen\", the same is an individual right by way of a guarantee which may not be subjected to discrimination in the matter of rights, privileges and immunities pertaining to him as a citizen. In other words, the right conferred by Article 15 is personal. A statute, which restricts a right of a class of citizens in the matter of testamentary disposition who may belong to a particular religion, would, therefore, not attract the wrath of clause (1) of Article 15 of the Constitution of India.\" Mr. Nariman is, therefore, right in distinguishing this case on facts and the nature of legislation challenged and the infirmities found. In fact, as he rightly submits, this decision, if at all, supports the case of the respondents, so far as challenge based on Article 15 is concerned.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: The appellants next relied on the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?]. In that case the constitutional validity of Sections 7, 8 and 76 of the Chotanagar Tenancy Act, 1908 was challenged on the ground that the provisions violated Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The right to intestate succession of Scheduled Tribe Women was governed by custom.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: Sections 7 and 8 provided for exclusive right of male succession to the tenancy rights. Section 76 of the Act saved any custom, usage, or customary right not inconsistent with, or not expressly or by necessary implication modified or abolished by the provisions of the Act. This Court did not consider it desirable to declare the customs of tribal inhabitants as offending Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India, though each case must be examined when full facts are placed before the Court. This Court however gave some relief to female dependents by declaring that upon the death of the male tenant, they could hold on to the land so long as they remained dependent on it for earning their livelihood, for otherwise it would render them destitute. Thus the exclusive right of male succession conceived of in Sections 7 and 8 has to remain in suspended animation so long as the right of livelihood of the female descendants of the male holder remained valid and in vogue. We find no principle laid down in this decision to support the case of the appellants herein, who in effect seek to challenge the validity of a custom recognized by and given effect to, by law. On the contrary, this Court was of the view that striking down such a law on the touchstone of Article 14 would bring about a chaos in the existing state of law.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: We also do not find anything in the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?] to support the case of the appellants. All that was held in that case was that by mere conversion to Christanity one does not cease to be a Scheduled Tribe if despite conversion he continues to follow the tribal traits and customs. No such question arose in this case.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: None of the decisions cited by the appellants supports the challenge to Section 3 of the Act of 1959 and the Notifications impugned in the writ petitions on the ground of violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution. On the other hand counsel for the respondents relied upon decisions in support of their contention, that the exclusion of Christians from contesting the election to the post of Dolloi in Jowai Elaka is not only on the ground of religion and, therefore, their exclusion cannot be challenged on the ground of violating Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It was also contended that historical reasons may as well support the classification, provided it is rational and bears a nexus with the object sought to be achieved. It was submitted that what was sought to be protected was indeed the tribal culture of the people inhabiting the autonomous District of Jowai. Their tribal sentiments and religious values have been sought to be protected and given due respect having regard to social and economic considerations of the tribals inhabiting in the autonomous District. Thus they contend that the exclusion is not based only on the ground of religion and consequently there is no discrimination within the meaning of Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. In this connection they have relied upon a decision of this Court in [?CITATION?] wherein this Court observed :- \"Even otherwise, what Articles 15(1) and 16(2) prohibits is that discrimination should not be made only and only on the ground of sex. These articles of the Constitution do not prohibit the State from making discrimination on the ground of sex coupled with other considerations. On this point, the matter is no longer res integra but is covered by several authorities of this Court.\" In [?CITATION?] the challenge to Section 213 and 57 of the Succession Act, 1925 was considered and repelled. No doubt this Court held that the basis of the challenge, namely  that Section 213(1) of the Act was applicable only to Christians and not to any other religion, was not correct. However, the Court made pertinent observations in the following words :- \"We have shown above that it is applicable to Parsis after the amendment of the Act in 1962 and to Hindus who reside within the territories which on 1.9.1870 were subject to the Lt.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: Governor of Bengal or to areas covered by original jurisdiction of the High Courts of Bombay and Madras and to all wills made outside those territories and limits so far as they relate to immovable property situate within those territories and limits. If that is so, it cannot be said that the section is exclusively applicable only to Christians and, therefore, it is discriminatory.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: The whole foundation of the case is thus lost. The differences are not based on any religion but for historical reasons that in the British Empire in India, probate was required to prove the right of a legatee or an executor but not in Part \"B\" or \"C\" States. That position has continued even after the Constitution has come into force. Historical reasons may justify differential treatment of separate geographical regions provided it bears a reasonable and just relation to the matter in respect of which differential treatment is accorded. Uniformity in law has to be achieved, but that is a long drawn process. Undoubtedly, the States and Union should be alive to this problem. Only on the basis that some differences arise in one or the other States in regard to testamentary succession, the law does not become discriminatory so as to be invalid. Such differences are bound to arise in a federal set up.\" In [?CITATION?] reservation of one seat for the Sangha in the Sikkim Assembly was challenged. In the reply it was urged that though Sangha was essentially a religious institution of the Buddhists, it however, occupied a unique position in the political, social and cultural life of the Sikkimese Society and the one seat reserved for it cannot, therefore, be said to be based on considerations 'only' of religion. This Court repelled the contention that reservation of one seat in favour of the Sangha is one purely based on religious considerations and, therefore, violative of Articles 15(1) and 325 of the Constitution of India and offended its secular principles. This Court held :- \"The Sangha, the Buddha and the Dharma are the three fundamental postulates and symbols of Buddhism. In that sense they are religious institutions. However, the literature on the history of development of the political institutions of Sikkim adverted to earlier tend to show that the Sangha had played an important role in the political and social life of the Sikkimese people. It had made its own contribution to the Sikkimese culture and political development. There is material to sustain the conclusion that the 'Sangha' had for long associated itself closely with the political developments of Sikkim and was inter-woven with the social and political life of its people. In view of this historical association, the provisions in the matter of reservation of a seat for the Sangha recognises the social and political role of the institution more than its purely religious identity. In the historical setting of Sikkim and its social and political evolution the provision has to be construed really as not invoking the impermissible idea of a separate electorate either. Indeed, the provision bears comparison to Art. 333 providing for representation for the Anglo-Indian community.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: So far as the provision for the Sangha is concerned, it is to be looked at as enabling a nomination but the choice of the nominee being left to the 'Sangha' itself. We are conscious that a separate electorate for a religious denomination would be obnoxious to the fundamental principles of our secular Constitution. If a provision is made purely on the basis of religious considerations for election of a member of that religious group on the basis of a separate electorate, that would, indeed, be wholly unconstitutional. But in the case of Sangha, it is not merely a religious institution. It has been historically a political and social institution in Sikkim and the provisions in regard to the seat reserved admit of being construed as a nomination and the Sangha itself being assigned the task of and enabled to indicate the choice of its nominee. The provision can be sustained on this construction. Contention (g) is answered accordingly.\" These decisions do justify the stand of the respondents that unless it is shown that the exclusion of Christians was only on religious ground, the challenge cannot be sustained. In the instant case, we have noticed the reasons why such an exclusion was made and we have also held that the reasons therefor are neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. We, therefore, conclude agreeing with the High Court that Section 3(1) of the Act of 1959 as also the Notifications impugned in the writ petitions cannot be struck down on the ground of violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: We may notice that the High Court has held that the spiritual fraternity represented by classes belonging to Niam Tynrai Niamtre (Non- christian) who practice the indigenous religion within the Raij Jowai is a socio cultural religious organization of Jaintia people who follow Niam Tynrai Niamtre faith. They are governed by common customary laws of their own in the matters of administration as well in following religious faith. These classes within the Raij Jowai being followers of Niam Tynrai Niamtre are certainly a religious denomination within the meaning of Article 26 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: Before us also, Mr. Goswami, learned counsel appearing for the respondents urged submissions based on Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India. Mr. Nariman, however, laid emphasis on Article 29 of the Constitution of India and submitted that the effort was really to conserve the culture of the tribal population in the autonomous District and, therefore, protected by Article 29 of the Constitution of India. These are matters which may require consideration in an appropriate case. So far as the instant case is concerned, having found that the challenge to the impugned provisions and Notifications was not sustainable on the ground of violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India, it is not necessary for us to deal with other issues which the respondents have urged on the basis of Articles 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution of India in support of their stand.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: In the result these appeals fail and are dismissed. \n"

      "Paragraph 2: 2\\. These appeals arise out of an order passed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad whereby Writ Petition 2 No.15196 of 2007 has been allowed and the order passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad Bench in OA No.748 of 2006 set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 3\\. Senior Divisional Personnel Officer, East Coast Railway, Visakhapatnam, issued a notification proposing to conduct a written/practical typewriting test for filling up the vacant posts of Chief Typists in the pay-scale of Rs.5500-9000. In response as many as 12 candidates appeared in the test held on 30th October, 2006 the result whereof was announced on 22nd November, 2006. Some of the candidates who failed to qualify made a representation complaining about the manner in which the test was conducted alleging that defective typewriting machines provided to them placed them at a disadvantage vis-a-vis candidates declared successful. The successful candidates also appear to have made a representation impressing upon the authorities to go ahead with the interviews and to complete the selection process expeditiously. Since that did not happen, OA No.748 of 2006 was filed before the CAT by one of the successful 3 candidates for a direction to respondent to proceed with the selection. In the meantime the Divisional Manager of the appellant-Railways issued an order on 14th of December, 2006 cancelling the typewriting test conducted on 30th October, 2006. By another notification of even date a fresh typewriting test was notified to be held on 16th December, 2006 for all the 12 in-service candidates who had appeared in the earlier test. By an interim order passed by the Tribunal the railway authorities were allowed to conduct the proposed second test in which the applicant before the Tribunal could also appear. The applicant was at the same time permitted to amend the prayer in the OA to assail the order passed by the Divisional Manager of the Railways cancelling the earlier test.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 4\\. It is not in dispute that pursuant to the said notification and the order passed by the Tribunal a fresh test was indeed conducted in which all the eligible in-service candidates appeared although the result of the said test has not been 4 announced so far. The Tribunal eventually dismissed OA No.748 of 2006 holding that the test earlier conducted was rightly cancelled inasmuch as the candidates were made to take the test in batches and no option was given to them to bring their own typewriters. The Tribunal further held that although some of the candidates had made representation as early as on 23rd October, 2006 seeking permission to use computers their request was not considered. All this according to the Tribunal justified the cancellation of the typewriting test held on 30th October and the issue of a notification for a fresh test.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 5\\. Aggrieved by the order passed by the Tribunal Shri Mahadev Appa Rao declared successful in the first test filed Writ Petition No.15196/2007 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh which has by the order impugned in the present appeal allowed the same and set aside the order passed by the Tribunal as also the order by which the earlier test was cancelled. The High Court further directed the 5 respondent to proceed with the selection process pursuant to notification dated 18th October, 2006 and the practical test conducted on 30th October, 2006 in terms thereof. The present appeals, as noted above, assail the correctness of the said order.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 6\\. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at some length and perused the record. The High Court has found fault with the order cancelling the earlier test primarily because the same was unsupported by any reasons whatsoever. The said order is in the following words:\n",
      "Paragraph 7: \"The practical test conducted to Hd. Typists in scale Rs.5000-8000 (RSRP) on 30.10.2006 in connection with the selection of Chief Typist in scale Rs.5500-9000 (RSRP) to form a panel of 4 UR + 1 SC and the results published vide O.A. No. Estt/Pers/52/2006, Dt. 22.12.2006 are hereby cancelled.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 7\\. The High Court was also of the view that no reasons for cancellation of the test having been recorded even on the file contemporaneously maintained for that purpose, the 6 same could not be supplied in the affidavit filed in reply to the Writ Petition challenging the said order, especially when the cancellation of the test was not according to the High Court necessitated by any irregularity in the conduct of the test or any mala fides vitiating the same. In the absence of any such infirmity the cancellation of the examination was arbitrary and unsustainable, declared the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 8\\. There is no quarrel with the well-settled proposition of law that an order passed by a public authority exercising administrative/executive or statutory powers must be judged by the reasons stated in the order or any record or file contemporaneously maintained. It follows that the infirmity arising out of the absence of reasons cannot be cured by the authority passing the order stating such reasons in an affidavit filed before the Court where the validity of any such order is under challenge. The legal position in this regard is settled by the decisions of this Court in [?CITATION?] wherein this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 10: \"Public orders, publicly made, in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he meant, or of what was in his mind, or what he intended to do. Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the actings and conduct of those to whom they are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself. \"\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 9\\. Reference may also be made to the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?] where this Court reiterated the above principle in the following words:\n",
      "Paragraph 12: \"8\\. The second equally relevant matter is that when a statutory functionary makes an order based on certain grounds, its validity must be judged by the reasons so mentioned and cannot be supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise. Otherwise, an order bad in the beginning may, by the time it comes to court on account of a challenge, get validated by additional grounds later brought out.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 8\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 10\\. Later decisions of this Court in [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] have re-stated the legal position settled by the earlier two decisions noticed above.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: 11\\. Relying upon the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?], Mr. Malhotra all the same argued that the challenge to the order cancelling the test was legally untenable as no candidate had any legally enforceable right to any post until he was selected and an order of appointment issued in his favour. Cancellation of the selection process on the ground of malpractices could not, therefore, be subjected to judicial scrutiny before a Writ Court, at the instance of a candidate who had not even found a place in the select list.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 9\n",
      "Paragraph 17: 12\\. A Constitution Bench of this Court in [?CITATION?] had an occasion to examine whether a candidate seeking appointment to a civil post can be regarded to have acquired an indefeasible right to appointment again such post merely because his name appeared in the merit list of candidates for such post.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Answering the question in the negative this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 19: \"It is not correct to say that if a number of vacancies are notified for appointment and adequate number of candidates are found fit, the successful candidates acquire an indefeasible right to be appointed which cannot be legitimately denied. Ordinarily the notification merely amounts to an invitation to qualified candidates to apply for recruitment and on their selection they do not acquire any right to the post. Unless the relevant recruitment rules so indicate, the State is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies. However, it does not mean that the State has the licence of acting in an arbitrary manner. The decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be taken bona fide for appropriate reasons. And if the vacancies or any of them are filled up, the State is bound to respect the comparative merit of the candidates, as reflected at the recruitment test, and no discrimination can be permitted. This correct position has been consistently followed by this Court, and we do not find any discordant note in the decisions in [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]\"\n",
      "Paragraph 20: 13\\. It is evident from the above that while no candidate acquires an indefeasible right to a post merely because he has appeared in the examination or even found a place in the select list, yet the State does not enjoy an unqualified prerogative to refuse an appointment in an arbitrary fashion or to disregard the merit of the candidates as reflected by the merit list prepared at the end of the selection process.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: The validity of the State's decision not to make an appointment is thus a matter which is not beyond judicial review before a competent Writ court. If any such decision is indeed found to be arbitrary, appropriate directions can be issued in the matter.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 14\\. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?], where again this Court reiterated that while a candidate who finds a place in the select list 11 may have no vested right to be appointed to any post, in the absence of any specific rules entitling him to the same, he may still be aggrieved of his non-appointment if the authority concerned acts arbitrarily or in a malafide manner.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: That was also a case where selection process had been cancelled by the Chandigarh Administration upon receipt of complaints about the unfair and injudicious manner in which the select list of candidates for appointment as conductors in CTU was prepared by the Selection Board. An inquiry got conducted into the said complaint proved the allegations made in the complaint to be true. It was in that backdrop that action taken by the Chandigarh Administration was held to be neither discriminatory nor unjustified as the same was duly supported by valid reasons for cancelling what was described by this Court to be as a \"dubious selection\".\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 15\\. Applying these principles to the case at hand there is no gainsaying that while the candidates who appeared in the typewriting test had no indefeasible or absolute right to seek 12 an appointment, yet the same did not give a licence to the competent authority to cancel the examination and the result thereof in an arbitrary manner. The least which the candidates who were otherwise eligible for appointment and who had appeared in the examination that constituted a step in aid of a possible appointment in their favour, were entitled to is to ensure that the selection process was not allowed to be scuttled for malafide reasons or in an arbitrary manner. It is trite that Article 14 of the Constitution strikes at arbitrariness which is an anti thesis of the guarantee contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Whether or not the cancellation of the typing test was arbitrary is a question which the Court shall have to examine once a challenge is mounted to any such action, no matter the candidates do not have an indefeasible right to claim an appointment against the advertised posts.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: 16\\. What then is meant for arbitrary/arbitrariness and how far can the decision of the competent authority in the present case be described as arbitrary? Black's Law 13 Dictionary describes the term \"arbitrary\" in the following words:\n",
      "Paragraph 26: \"1\\. Depending on individual discretion;\n",
      "Paragraph 27: specif., determined by a judge rather than by fixed rules, procedures, or law. 2. (Of a judicial decision) founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: This type of decision is often termed arbitrary and capricious.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 17\\. To the same effect is the meaning given to the expression \"arbitrary\" by Corpus Juris Secundum which explains the term in the following words:\n",
      "Paragraph 30: \"ARBITRARY - Based alone upon one's will, and not upon any course of reasoning and exercise of judgment; bound by no law;\n",
      "Paragraph 31: capricious; exercised according to one's own will or caprice and therefore conveying a notion of a tendency to abuse possession of power; fixed or done capriciously or at pleasure, without adequate determining principle, nonrational, or not done or acting according to reason or judgment; not based upon actuality but beyond a reasonable extent; not founded in the nature of things;\n",
      "Paragraph 32: not governed by any fixed rules or standard;\n",
      "Paragraph 33: also, in a somewhat different sense, absolute in power, despotic, or tyrannical; harsh and 14 unforbearing. When applied to acts, \"arbitrary\" has been held to connote a disregard of evidence or of the proper weight thereof; to express an idea opposed to administrative, executive, judicial, or legislative discretion; and to imply at least an element of bad faith, and has been compared with \"willful\".\n",
      "Paragraph 34: 18\\. There is no precise statutory or other definition of the term \"arbitrary\". In [?CITATION?], this Court explained that the true import of the expression \"arbitrariness\" is more easily visualized than precisely stated or defined and that whether or not an act is arbitrary would be determined on the facts and circumstances of a given case. This Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 35: \"The meaning and true import of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely stated or defined. The question, whether an impugned act is arbitrary or not, is ultimately to be answered on the facts and in the circumstances of a given case. An obvious test to apply is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned act and if so, does it satisfy the test of reasonableness. Where a mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no 15 impediment in following that procedure, performance of the act otherwise and in a manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable, may itself attract the vice of arbitrariness. Every State action must be informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed by reason, is arbitrary. Rule of law contemplates governance by laws and not by humour, whims or caprices of the men to whom the governance is entrusted for the time being. It is trite that `be you ever so high, the laws are above you'. This is what men in power must remember, always.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 19\\. Dealing with the principle governing exercise of official power Prof. De Smith, Woolf & Jowell in their celebrated book on \"Judicial Review of Administrative Action\"\n",
      "Paragraph 37: emphasized how the decision-maker invested with the wide discretion is expected to exercise that discretion in accordance with the general principles governing exercise of power in a constitutional democracy unless of course the statute under which such power is exercisable indicates otherwise. One of the most fundamental principles of rule of law recognized in all democratic systems is that the power vested in any competent authority shall not be exercised arbitrarily and that the power is exercised that it does not 16 lead to any unfair discrimination. The following passage from the above is in this regard apposite:\n",
      "Paragraph 38: \"We have seen in a number of situations how the scope of an official power cannot be interpreted in isolation from general principles governing the exercise of power in a constitutional democracy. The courts presume that these principles apply to the exercise of all powers and that even where the decision-maker is invested with wide discretion, that discretion is to be exercised in accordance with those principles unless Parliament clearly indicates otherwise. One such principle, the rule of law, contains within it a number of requirements such as the right of the individual to access to the law and that power should not be arbitrarily exercised. The rule of law above all rests upon the principle of legal certainty, which will be considered here, along with a principle which is partly but not wholly contained within the rule of law, namely, the principle of equality, or equal treatment without unfair discrimination.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 20\\. Arbitrariness in the making of an order by an authority can manifest itself in different forms. Non-application of mind by the authority making the order is only one of them.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: Every order passed by a public authority must disclose due 17 and proper application of mind by the person making the order. This may be evident from the order itself or the record contemporaneously maintained. Application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of mind by the authority making the order. And disclosure is best done by recording the reasons that led the authority to pass the order in question. Absence of reasons either in the order passed by the authority or in the record contemporaneously maintained is clearly suggestive of the order being arbitrary hence legally unsustainable.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 21\\. In the instant case the order passed by the competent authority does not state any reasons whatsoever for the cancellation of the typing test. It is nobody's case that any such reasons were set out even in any contemporaneous record or file. In the absence of reasons in support of the order it is difficult to assume that the authority had properly applied its mind before passing the order cancelling the test.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 18\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 22\\. Mr. Malhotra's contention that the order was passed entirely on the basis of the complaint received from the unsuccessful candidates is also of no assistance. The fact that some representations were received against the test or the procedure followed for the same could not by itself justify cancellation of the test unless the authority concerned applied its mind to the allegations levelled by the persons making the representation and came to the conclusion that the grievance made in the complaint was not without merit.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: If a test is cancelled just because some complaints against the same have been made howsoever frivolous, it may lead to a situation where no selection process can be finalized as those who fail to qualify can always make a grievance against the test or its fairness. What is important is that once a complaint or representation is received the competent authority applies its mind to the same and records reasons why in its opinion it is necessary to cancel the examination in the interest of purity of the selection process or with a view to preventing injustice or prejudice to 19 those who have appeared in the same. That is precisely what had happened in Dilbagh Singh's case (supra). The examination was cancelled upon an inquiry into the allegations of unjust, arbitrary and dubious selection list prepared by the Selection Board in which the allegations were found to be correct. Even in Tarun K. Singh's case (supra) relied upon by Mr. Malhotra an inquiry into the complaints received against the selection process was conducted no matter after the cancellation of the examination. This Court in that view held that since the selection process was vitiated by procedural and other infirmities cancellation thereof was perfectly justified.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 23\\. That is not, however, the position in the instant case.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: The order of cancellation passed by the competent authority was not preceded even by a prima facie satisfaction about the correctness of the allegations made by the unsuccessful candidates leave alone an inquiry into the same. The minimum that was expected of the authority was a due and proper application of mind to the allegations made before it 20 and formulation and recording of reasons in support of the view that the competent authority was taking. There may be cases where an enquiry may be called for into the allegations, but there may also be cases, where even on admitted facts or facts verified from record or an enquiry howsoever summary the same maybe, it is possible for the competent authority to take a decision, that there are good reasons for making the order which the authority eventually makes. But we find it difficult to sustain an order that is neither based on an enquiry nor even a prima facie view taken upon a due and proper application of mind to the relevant facts. Judged by that standard the order of cancellation passed by the competent authority falls short of the legal requirements and was rightly quashed by the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: 24\\. We may hasten to add that while application of mind to the material available to the competent authority is an essential pre-requisite for the making of a valid order, that requirement should not be confused with the sufficiency of 21 such material to support any such order. Whether or not the material placed before the competent authority was in the instant case sufficient to justify the decision taken by it, is not in issue before us. That aspect may have assumed importance only if the competent authority was shown to have applied its mind to whatever material was available to it before cancelling the examination. Since application of mind as a thresh-hold requirement for a valid order is conspicuous by its absence the question whether the decision was reasonable having regard to the material before the authority is rendered academic. Sufficiency or otherwise of the material and so also its admissibility to support a decision the validity whereof is being judicially reviewed may even otherwise depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. No hard and fast rule can be formulated in that regard nor do we propose to do so in this case. So also whether the competent authority ought to have conducted an enquiry into or verification of the allegations before passing an order of cancellation is a 22 matter that would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. It may often depend upon the nature, source and credibility of the material placed before the authority.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: It may also depend upon whether any such exercise is feasible having regard to the nature of the controversy, the constraints of time, effort and expense. But what is absolutely essential is that the authority making the order is alive to the material on the basis of which it purports to take a decision. It cannot act mechanically or under an impulse, for a writ court judicially reviewing any such order cannot countenance the exercise of power vested in a public authority except after due and proper application of mind.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: Any other view would amount to condoning a fraud upon such power which the authority exercising the same holds in trust only to be exercised for a legitimate purpose and along settled principles of administrative law.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 25\\. The next question then is whether the selection should be finalized on the basis of the test held earlier or the matter allowed to be re-examined by the authority in the context of 23 the representation received by it. In our opinion the latter course would be more in tune with the demands of justice and fairness especially when a second test has been conducted in which all the in service candidates have appeared. The result of this examination/test has not, however, been declared so far apparently because of the pendency of these proceedings. If upon due and proper consideration of the representation received from the candidates who were unsuccessful in the first examination, the competent authority comes to the conclusion that the test earlier held suffered from any infirmity or did not give a fair opportunity to all the candidates, it shall be free to pass a fresh order cancelling the said examination after recording such a finding in which event the second test conducted under the directions of the Tribunal would become the basis for the selection process to be finalized in accordance with law. In case, however, the authority comes to the conclusion that the earlier test suffered from no procedural or other infirmity or did not cause any prejudice to any candidate, 24 the second test/examination shall stand cancelled and the process of selection finalized on the basis of the test held earlier. The order passed by the High Court is to that extent modified and the present appeals disposed of leaving the parties to bear their own costs. In order to avoid any delay in the finalization of the process of appointments which have already been delayed, we direct that the competent authority shall pass an appropriate order on the subject expeditiously but not later than two months from today. \n"

      "Paragraph 1: The matter calls for an authoritative pronouncement as to whether the Board of Control for Cricket in India (Board) which is a cricket controlling authority in terms of the ICC Rules answers the description of \"Other Authorities\" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: BACKGROUND FACTS:\n",
      "Paragraph 3: The First Petitioner is one of the largest vertically integrated media entertainment groups in India. The Board, the second Respondent herein, is a Society registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act which is said to be recognized by the Union of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The Third and Fourth Respondents are President and Secretary respectively of the Second Respondent. The Fifth Respondent, \"ESPN Star Sports\", known as \"ESS\" is a partnership firm of the United States of America having a branch office in Singapore. The Sixth Respondent is a firm of Chartered Accountants which was engaged by Board in relation to the tender floated on 07.08.2004. Pursuant to or in furtherance of a notice inviting tender for grant of exclusive television rights for a period of four years, several entertainment groups including the Petitioners and the Fifth Respondent herein gave their offers. For the purpose of this matter, we would presume that both the Petitioners and the said Respondent were found eligible therefor. The First Petitioner gave an offer for an amount of US $ 260,756,756.76 (INR equivalent to Rs.12,060,000,000/- (Rupees twelve thousand sixty million only - @ INR 46.25/US $) Or US $ 281,189,189.19 (INR equivalent to Rs.13,005,000,000/- (Rupees thirteen thousand five million only - @ INR 46.25/US $).\n",
      "Paragraph 4: Upon holding negotiations with the First Petitioner as also the Fifth Respondent, the Board decided to accept the offer of the former; pursuant to and in furtherance whereof a sum of Rs. 92.50 crores equivalent to US $ 20 millions was deposited in the State Bank of Travancore. In response to a draft letter of intent sent by the Board, the First Petitioner agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of offer subject to the conditions mentioned therein.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: The Fifth Respondent in the meanwhile filed a writ petition before the Bombay High Court which was marked as Writ Petition (L) No. 2462 of 2004\\. The parties thereto filed their affidavits in the said proceeding. In its affidavit, the Board justified its action in granting the contract in favour of the First Petitioner. The matter was taken up for hearing on day to day basis.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: Arguments of the Fifth Respondent as also the First Petitioner had been advanced. On 21.9.2004, however, the Board before commencing its argument stated that it purported to have cancelled the entire tender process on the premise that no concluded contract was reached between the parties as no letter of intent had therefor been issued. The First Petitioner, however, raised a contention that such a concluded contract in fact had been arrived at. The Fifth Respondent, in view of the statements made by the counsel for the Board, prayed for withdrawal of the writ petition, which was permitted.\n",

Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Second Respondent raised an issue as regard maintainability of the writ petition on the premise that the Board is not a 'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.\n",

      "Paragraph 22: The factors pleaded by the writ petitioners herein which would allegedly demonstrate that the Board is an authority that would be subject to the constitutional discipline of Part III of the Constitution of India, are as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 23: \"a. It undertakes all activities in relation to Cricket including entering into the contracts for awarding telecast and broadcasting rights, for advertisement revenues in the Stadium etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: b. The team fielded by the BCCI plays as \"Indian Team\" while playing One Day Internationals or Test Matches  it cannot be gainsaid that the team purports to represent India as a nation, and its wins are matters of national prestige. They wear uniform that carries the national flag, and are treated as sports ambassadors of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: c. The sportsmen of today are professionals who devote their life to playing the game. They are paid a handsome remuneration by the BCCI for their participation in the team. Thus, they are not amateurs who participate on an honorary basis. Consequently they have a right under Article 19(1)(g) to be considered for participation in the game. The BCCI claims the power to debar players from playing cricket in exercise of its disciplinary powers. Obviously, it is submitted, a body that purports to exercise powers that impinge on the fundamental rights of citizens would constitute at least an \"authority\" within the meaning of Art. 12 of the Constitution  it can hardly contend that it has the power to arbitrarily deny players all rights to even be considered for participation in a tournament which they are included as a team from \"India\".\n",
      "Paragraph 26: d. This Hon'ble Court has already, by its interim orders., directed a free to air telecast of the matches that were played in Pakistan in which a team selected by the Respondent BCCI participated. This was done, it is respectfully submitted, keeping in view the larger public interest involved in telecasting of such a sport. Surely, the regulatory body that controls solely and to the exclusion of all others, the power to organize such games, and to select a team that would participate in such games is performing a public function that must be discharged in a manner that complies with the constitutional discipline of Part III of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: If the events organized are public events, then it is submitted that the body that is the controlling authority of such public events would surely be subject to the discipline of Art. 14 and 19 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: e. It is also submitted that even domestically, all representative cricket can only be under its aegis. No representative tournament can be organized without the permission of BCCI or its affiliates at any level of cricket.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: f. The BCCI and its affiliates are the recipients of State largesse, inter alia, in the form of nominal rent for stadia. It is submitted that the BCCI is performing one of the most important public functions for the country with the authorization and recognition by the Govt. of India, is amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court under the provisions of the Constitution of India.\" Union of India:\n",
      "Paragraph 30: Union of India contends that the Board is a State. In support of the said plea an affidavit affirmed by Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has been filed. A large number of documents have also been filed to show that the Board had all along been acting as a recognized body and as regard international matches has always been seeking its prior permission. The Board had also been under the administrative control of the Government of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: Board :\n",
      "Paragraph 32: In support of its plea that it is not a 'State', the Second Respondent in its Counter Affidavit asserted :\n",
      "Paragraph 33: \"(a) Board of Control of Cricket in India, the Respondent No.2 is an autonomous non-profit making Association limited and restricted to its Members only and registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act. It is a private organization whose objects are to promote the game of Cricket. Its functions are regulated and governed by its own Rules and Regulations independent of any statute and are only related to its members. The Rules and Regulations of the Respondent no.2 have neither any statutory force nor it has any statutory powers to make rules or regulations having statutory force.\n",

      "Paragraph 37: (d) The Respondent no.2 receives no grant of assistance in any form or manner from the Government in this context. It may be stated that in a writ petition in the case of Rahul Mehra vs. Union of India in the Hon'ble High Court at Delhi. \"Union of India\" filed Affidavits stating categorically that there is no Government control of any nature upon the Board of Control for Cricket in India and as it does not follow the Government Guidelines which have been consolidated and issued under the title \"Sports India Operation Excellence\" vide Circular No.F.1-27/86-DESK-1 (SP- IV) dated 16th February, 1988 issued by the Department of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India has neither extended any financial assistance to the Board of Control for Cricket in India nor has any relationship of whatsoever nature with it and no financial assistance is also extended for participation of any tournament, competition or otherwise organized by the Respondent No.2. Copies of the said Affidavits are annexed hereto as Exhibits \"A\" and \"B\" respectively.\n",

Only when for the purpose of organizing any match or tournament with foreign participants, the Respondent no.2 requires normal and scheduled permissions from the Ministry of Sports for travel of foreign teams, it obtains the same like any other private organization, particularly in the subject matter of foreign exchange. The Respondent No.2 is the only autonomous sporting body which not only does not obtain any financial grants but on the contrary earns foreign exchange.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: (f) Organizing Cricket Matches and/or Tournaments between the Teams of the Members of the Respondent No.2 and/or with the co-members of International Cricket Council cannot be said to be a facet of public function or government in character. No monopoly status has been conferred upon the Respondent No.2 either by Statute or by the Government. Any other body could organize any matches on its own and neither the Respondent no.2 nor the Government could oppose the same. As a matter of fact, number of cricket matches including International matches are played in the Country which have nothing to do with the Respondent No.2. Respondent No.2 has no monopoly over sending teams overseas for the game of cricket and to control the entire game of cricket in India.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: Matches which are sanctioned or recognized by the ICC are only known as Official Test matches or One day International Matches. Respondent no.2 is entitled to invite teams of other members of ICC or send teams to participate in such matches by virtue of its membership of ICC.\" ESS :\n",
      "Paragraph 41: Although, as noticed hereinbefore, ESS itself filed a writ petition before the Bombay High Court on the ground that the same was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, it now contends that although a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court would be maintainable but not one under Article 32 thereof as the Board is not a 'State'.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: SUBMISSIONS OF THE LEARNED COUNSEL :\n",
      "Paragraph 43: Mr. K.K. Venugopal, the learned senior counsel appearing in support of the preliminary issue would submit that as the Board does not come within the purview of any of the six legal tests laid down by this Court in [?CITATION?], it would not be a `State'. Our attention, in this behalf, has been drawn to paragraphs 25, 27, 30, 31, 38, 42 to 45, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 to 55 of the said judgment . It was contended that the Board is an autonomous body and the Central Government does not have any control thereover either financially or administratively or functionally. It was urged that neither the Central Government gives any monetary grant nor nominates any member in the Governing Body of the Board nor has anything to do with its internal affairs. It was pointed out by the learned counsel that even the Union of India had agreed before the Bombay High Court that the Board had the exclusive telecasting rights as owner of the events. The Board furthermore does not exercise any sovereign or governmental functions; Mr. Venugopal would argue that furthermore the Board has not even been recognized by the Union of India nor has it any role to play as regard framing of its rules and regulations.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Third Respondent herein, would supplement the arguments of Mr.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: Venugopal contending that the activity of a body like Board does not involve any public duty or public function and although its action is public in nature, the same would not amount to a governmental action. Reliance, in this connection, has been placed on [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 46: The leaned counsel has also drawn our attention to a decision of this Court in [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 47: According to Dr. Singhvi, there exists a distinction between Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution of India. Reliance in this behalf has been placed on a decision of this Court in [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 48: Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf the fifth Respondent, would contend that the nature of the function of the concerned authority plays an important role in determining the question and only where the function is governmental in nature or where the authority is vested under a statute, it would attract the definition of \"other authorities\" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and not otherwise. The learned counsel would, however, submit that in Aga Khan (supra), the Court of Appeal has accepted that there may be some cases where the judicial review would be maintainable. Drawing our attention to a decision of this Court in [?CITATION?], the learned counsel would urge that Board does not fulfil the tests laid down therein.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: Mr. Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Writ Petitioners, on the other hand, would take us through the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Board as also the rules and regulations framed by it and contend that from a perusal thereof it would be manifest that it exercises extensive power in selecting players for the Indian National team in the international events. The Board, also exercises stringent disciplinary powers over players, umpires, members of the team and other officers. It is the contention of Mr. Salve that the activities of the Board in effect and substance are governmental functions in the area of sports. An exclusive right has been granted to it to regulate the sport in the name of the country resulting in exercise of functions of larger dimension of public entertainment. When a body like the Board has received recognition from the Union of India to allow it to represent India as a country, its character must be held to have changed from private body to a public authority. It was submitted that the players put on colours of National Flag on their attire.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: Because of the nature of its actions the International Cricket Council has recognized the Board not in its capacity as a cricket playing club but as a representative of India, a cricket playing country. By its disciplinary action, Mr. Salve would argue, the Board may debar a player from representing the country as a result whereof his fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India would be affected. He would submit that the Board, therefore, is not an autonomous body discharging a private function only and in fact it deals with sporting events of the country. The learned counsel would argue that the Board acts strictly in terms of the foreign policy of the country as it refused to recognize a player who played in South Africa, as apartheid was being practiced therein which was consistent with India's foreign policy. It was further submitted that the cricket match between India and Pakistan could be held only with the permission of the Union of India as and when the relationship between the two countries improved.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: Mr. Salve, therefore, submits that the Board is a 'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India as:\n",
      "Paragraph 52: (i) it regulates cricket;\n",
      "Paragraph 53: (ii) It has a virtual monopoly;\n",
      "Paragraph 54: (iii) it seeks to put restrictions on the fundamental rights of the players and umpires to earn their livelihood as envisaged under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India;\n",
      "Paragraph 55: (iv) The cricket events managed by the third Respondent have a definite concept, connotation and significance which have a bearing on the performance of individual players as also the team as a national team representing the country in the entire field of cricket.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: Mr. Mohan Parasaran, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Union of India would contend that the functions of the Board are of public importance and closely related to governmental functions. Functions of the Board, the learned counsel would urge, also control free speech rights of citizens within a public forum which is essentially a governmental function.\n",

      "Paragraph 58: CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT :\n",
      "Paragraph 59: Our Constitution is an ongoing document and, thus, should be interpreted liberally. Interpretation of Article 12, having regard to the exclusive control and management of sport of cricket by the Board and enormous power exercised by it calls for a new approach. The Constitution, it is trite, should be interpreted in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was the state of law at the commencement of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: [See [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]] while referring to an amendment made in U.K. in relation to a provision which was in pari materia with Section 118 of the [Indian Succession Act, 1925], this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 61: \"...The constitutionality of a provision, it is trite, will have to be judged keeping in view the interpretive changes of the statute effected by passage of time.\" Referring to the changing scenario of the law and having regard to the declaration on the right to development adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights and Article 18 of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966, this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 62: \"It is trite that having regard to Article 13(1) of the Constitution, the constitutionality of the impugned legislation is required to be considered on the basis of laws existing on 26th January, 1950, but while doing so the court is not precluded from taking into consideration the subsequent events which have taken place thereafter.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: It is further trite that that the law although may be constitutional when enacted but with passage of time the same may be held to be unconstitutional in view of the changed situation.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: Justice Cardoze said :\n",
      "Paragraph 65: \"The law has its epochs of ebb and flow, the flood tides are on us. The old order may change yielding place to new; but the transition is never an easy process\".\n",
      "Paragraph 66: Albert Campus stated :\n",
      "Paragraph 67: \"The wheel turns, history changes\". Stability and change are the two sides of the same law-coin. In their pure form they are antagonistic poles; without stability the law becomes not a chart of conduct, but a gare of chance: with only stability the law is as the still waters in which there is only stagnation and death.\" In any view of the matter even if a provision was not unconstitutional on the day on which it was enacted or the Constitution came into force, by reason of facts emerging out thereafter, the same may be rendered unconstitutional.\" In [?CITATION?], this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 68: \"Referring to [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?], this Court held: \"There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that a law which was at one point of time constitutional may be rendered unconstitutional because of passage of time. We may note that apart from the decisions cited by Mr. Sanghi, recently a similar view has [?CITATION?] and John Vallamattom and Constitution of India is an ongoing document. It must be interpreted accordingly.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: In Francis Bennion's 'Statutory Interpretation', Fourth Edition at page 762, it is stated :\n",
      "Paragraph 70: \"It is presumed that Parliament intends the court to apply to ongoing Act a construction that continuously updates its wording to allow for changes since the Act was initially framed (an updating construction). While it remains law, it is to be treated as always speaking. This means that in its application on any date, the language of the Act, though necessarily embedded in its own time, is nevertheless to be construed in accordance with the need to treat it as current law.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: At page 764, it is commented :\n",
      "Paragraph 72: \"In construing an ongoing Act, the interpreter is to presume that Parliament intended the Act to be applied at any future time in such a way as to give effect to the true original intention. Accordingly, the interpreter is to make allowances for any relevant changes that have occurred, since the Act's passing, in law, social conditions, technology, the meaning of words, and other matters. Just as the US Constitution is regarded as 'a living Constitution', so an ongoing British Act is regarded as 'a living Act'. That today's construction involves the supposition that Parliament was catering long ago for a state of affairs that did not then exist is no argument against that construction. Parliament, in the wording of an enactment, is expected to anticipate temporal developments. The drafter will try to foresee the future, and allow for it in the wording.\" LEGISLATIVE POWERS :\n",
      "Paragraph 73: Although we will advert to various rival contentions raised at the Bar at some details a litter later but suffice it to notice at this stage that encouragement of games and sports is State function in terms of Entry 33 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India which reads thus:\n",
      "Paragraph 74: \"33. Theaters and dramatic performances; cinemas subject to the provisions of entry 60 of List 1; sports, entertainments and amusements.\" The State by reason of a legislative action cannot confer on it extra territorial jurisdiction in relation to sports, entertainment etc. Education, however, is in Concurrent List being Item No.25 of List III. Sport is considered to be a part of Education (within its expanded meaning). Sport has been included in the Human Resource Development as a larger part of education. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports was earlier a department of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. Now a separate Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has come into being, in terms of the Allocation of Business Rules.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: In [?CITATION?], this Court held :\n",
      "Paragraph 76: \"It may be true that what is protected by Article 19(1)(a) is an expression of thought and feeling and not of the physical or intellectual prowess or skill. It is also true that a person desiring to telecast sports events when he is not himself a participant in the game, does not seek to exercise his right of self-expression. However, the right to freedom of speech and expression also includes the right to educate, to inform and to entertain and also the right to be educated, informed and entertained. The former is the right of the telecaster and the latter that of the viewers. The right to telecast sporting event will therefore also include the right to educate and inform the present and the prospective sportsmen interested in the particular game and also to inform and entertain the lovers of the game. Hence, when a telecaster desires to telecast a sporting event, it is incorrect to say that free- speech element is absent from his right. The degree of the element will depend upon the character of the telecaster who claims the right. An organizer such as the BCCI or CAB in the present case which are indisputably devoted to the promotion of the game of cricket, cannot be placed in the same scale as the business organizations whose only intention is to make as large a profit as can be made by telecasting the game.\" [Emphasis supplied] It was held that sport is a form of expressive conduct.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: We may notice at this juncture that the Union of India in exercise of its executive functions in terms of the Allocation of Business Rules framed under Article 77 of the Constitution of India created a separate Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports for the said purpose. One of the objects of the Ministry is to work in close coordination with national federations that regulate sports. Keeping in view the fact that the Union of India is required to promote sports throughout India, it, as of necessity is required to coordinate between the activities of different States and furthermore having regard to the International arena, it is only the Union of India which can exercise such a power in terms of Entry 10, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and it may also be held to have requisite legislative competence in terms of Entry 97, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: ARTICLE 12:\n",
      "Paragraph 79: Before adverting to the core issues at some length we may take a look at Article 12 of the Constitution of India which reads as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 80: \"12. In this part, unless the context otherwise requires, \"the State\" includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.\" In this Article, the 'State' has not been defined. It is merely an inclusive definition. It includes all other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. It does not say that such other authorities must be under the control of the Government of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: The word 'or' is disjunctive and not conjunctive.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: The expression \"Authority\" has a definite connotation. It has different dimensions and, thus, must receive a liberal interpretation. To arrive at a conclusion, as to which \"other authorities\" could come within the purview of Article 12, we may notice the meaning of the word \"authority\".\n",
      "Paragraph 83: The word \"Other Authorities\" contained in Article 12 is not to be treated as ejusdam generis.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: In Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 10th Edition, the word 'authority' has been defined as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 85: \"1. the power or right to give orders and enforce obedience. 2. a person or organization exerting control in a particular political or administrative sphere. 3. the power to influence others based on recognized knowledge or expertise.\" Broadly, there are three different concepts which exist for determining the question which fall within the expression \"other authorities\".\n",
      "Paragraph 86: (i) The Corporations and the Societies created by the State for carrying on its trading activities in terms of Article 298 of the Constitution wherefor the capital, infrastructure, initial investment and financial aid etc. are provided by the State and it also exercises regulation and control thereover.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: (ii) Bodies created for research and other developmental works which is otherwise a governmental function but may or may not be a part of the sovereign function.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: (iii) A private body is allowed to discharge public duty or positive obligation of public nature and furthermore is allowed to perform regulatory and controlling functions and activities which were otherwise the job of the government.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: There cannot be same standard or yardstick for judging different bodies for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether it fulfills the requirements of law therefor or not.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: In Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra), a Seven-Judge Bench held :\n",
      "Paragraph 91: \"That an \"inclusive\" definition is generally not exhaustive is a statement of the obvious and as far as Article 12 is concerned, has been so held by this Court ([?CITATION?]). The words \"State\" and \"authority\" used in Article 12 therefore remain, to use the words of Cardozo (Benjamin Cardozo : The Nature of the Judicial Process), among \"the great generalities of the Constitution\" the content of which has been and continues to be supplied by courts from time to time.\" [See also [?CITATION?]] What is necessary is to notice the functions of the Body concerned. A `State' has different meanings in different context. In a traditional sense, it can be a body politic but in modern international practice, a State is an organization which receives the general recognition accorded to it by the existing group of other States. Union of India recognizes the Board as its representative. The expression \"other authorities\" in Article 12 of the Constitution of India is 'State' within the territory of India as contradistinguished from a State within the control of the Government of India. The concept of State under Article 12 is in relation to the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part-III of the Constitution and Directive Principles of the State Policy contained in Part-IV thereof. The contents of these two parts manifest that Article 12 is not confined to its ordinary or constitutional sense of an independent or sovereign meaning so as to include within its fold whatever comes within the purview thereof so as to instill the public confidence in it.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: The feature that the Board has been allowed to exercise the powers enabling it to trespass across the fundamental rights of a citizen is of great significance. In terms of the Memorandum of Association even the States are required to approach the Board for its direction. If the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in [?CITATION?] and development of law made therefrom is to be given full effect,. it is not only the functions of the Government alone which would enable a body to become a State but also when a body performs governmental functions or quasi-governmental functions as also when its business is of public importance and is fundamental for the life of the people. For the said purpose, we must notice that this Court in expanding the definition of State did not advisedly confine itself to the debates of Constitutional Assembly. It considered each case on its own merit. In Sukhdev Singh (supra), Mathew, J. stated that even big industrial houses and big trade unions would come in the purview thereof. While doing so the courts did not lose sight of the difference between the State activity and the individual activity. This Court took into consideration the fact that new rights in the citizens have been created and if any such right is violated, they must have access to justice which is a human right. No doubt, there is an ongoing debate as regard the effect of the globalization and/or opening up of market by reason of liberalization policy of the Government as to whether that the notion of sovereignty of the State is being thereby eroded or not but we are not concerned with the said question in this case. \"Other authorities\", inter- alia, would be there which inter alia function within the territory of India and the same need not necessarily be the Government of India, the Parliament of India, the Government of each of the States which constitute the Union of India or the legislation of the States.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: Article 12 must receive a purposive interpretation as by reason of Part III of the Constitution a charter of liberties against oppression and arbitrariness of all kinds of repositories of power have been conferred  the object being to limit and control power wherever it is found. A body exercising significant functions of public importance would be an authority in respect of these functions. In those respects it would be same as is executive government established under the Constitution and the establishments of organizations funded or controlled by the Government. A traffic constable remains an authority even if his salary is paid from the parking charges inasmuch as he still would have the right to control the traffic and anybody violating the traffic rules may be prosecuted at his instance.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: It is not that every body or association which is regulated in its private functions becomes a 'State'. What matters is the quality and character of functions discharged by the body and the State control flowing therefrom.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: In Daniel Lee (supra), it was held:\n",

      "Paragraph 97: The development of law in this field is well-known. At one point of time, the companies, societies etc. registered under the Indian Companies Act and Societies Registration Act were treated as separate corporate entities being governed by its own rules and regulations and, thus, held not to be 'States' although they were virtually run as department of the Government, but the situation has completely changed.

To speak of a consensual foundation for a body's power is largely beside the point where those who wish to partake in the activity will have no realistic choice but to accept that power. Black has argued that the emphasis given to the contractual foundations for a body's power as the reason for withholding review are misplaced. She contends that the courts are confusing contract as an instrument of economic exchange, with contract as a regulatory instrument. She argues further that the reliance placed on private law controls, such as restraint of trade and competition law, may also be misplaced here. Such controls are designed for the regulation of economic activity in the market place, and they may not be best suited to control potential abuse of regulatory power itself.\" (Emphasis added) SCOTLAND :\n",

While technically a private and voluntary sporting association, the Rugby Union is in relation to this decision in a position of major national importance, for the reasons already outlined. In this particular case, therefore, we are not willing to apply to the question of standing the narrowest of criteria that might be drawn from private law fields. In truth the case has some analogy with public law issues. This is not to be pressed too far. We are not holding that, nor even discussing whether, the decision is the exercise of a statutory power  although that was argued. We are saying simply that it falls into a special area where, in the New Zealand context, a sharp boundary between public and private law cannot realistically be drawn.\" It was opined that the petitioner therein had the necessary standing to seek judicial review.

In response to what is described as \"judicial paternalism\" the Local Government Ministers of Australia and New Zealand have commissioned a report on policy options to provide statutory limitations on the liability of local authorities.\" ALJR 1263] the court was concerned with the Australian Wheat Board (International) Ltd. (AWBI) a private corporation established in terms of Wheat Marketing Act, 1989 which had the sole right to export wheat. It had also the responsibility for the commercial aspects of wheat marketing through operating wheat pools. The Appellant therein who was a competitor of AWBI applied for grant of permit for the bulk export of wheat but the same was declined whereupon it was contended that the AWBI was contravening the Trade Practices Act, 1974. The decision of AWBI was questioned contending that it involved an improper exercise of discretionary power in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merit of the case. The following interesting observation was made therein:\n",
      "Paragraph 173: \"67.This appeal presents an opportunity for this Court to reaffirm that principle in circumstances, now increasingly common, where the exercise of public power, contemplated by legislation, is \"outsourced\" to a body having the features of a private sector corporation. The question of principle presented is whether, in the performance of a function provided to it by federal legislation, a private corporation is accountable according to the norms and values of public law or is cut adrift from such mechanisms of accountability and is answerable only to its shareholders and to the requirements of corporations law or like rules.\" [Emphasis supplied] As regards monopoly, it was opined:\n",
      "Paragraph 174: \"134. It may be that the statutory conferral of monopoly status on AWBI as a private corporation, in itself (particularly when viewed with the added fact that it was formed from what was once a public body) could impose obligations to observe the norms and values of public law, adapted by analogy, in particular instances of its decision-making. In such circumstances, quite apart from administrative law, it has sometimes been viewed as appropriate to impose duties to the community upon such corporations out of recognition of the particular powers they enjoy.\" In Datafin (supra) also, as was noticed, there did not exist ample statutory provisions relating to regulation of the trade. In Romeo (supra), the functioning of the corporation apart from grant of monopoly was also not controlled and regulated by any statute. It is in that sense, we presume, the expression \"outsourcing\" had been used by Kirby, J.\n",

I do not believe that it is the purpose of the games to set one way of life against another. But it cannot be denied that spectators, both in Moscow and all over the world, certainly will have such a thought in mind when the events take place.

Rec. 31662 (1978).\" [?CITATION?], the issue was as to whether the respondent \"which was incorporated to regulate interscholastic athletic competition among public and private secondary schools\" is engaged in state action when it enforced one of its rules against a member school. It was held that the pervasive entwinement of state school officials in the structure of the association would make it a state actor. The Court acknowledged that the analysis of whether state action existed was a \"necessarily fact-bound inquiry\" and noted that state action may be found only where there is \"such a close nexus between the State and the challenged action that seemingly private behavior may be fairly treated as that of the State itself\".\n",
      "Paragraph 178: In Brentwood Academy (supra), it was held:\n",
      "Paragraph 179: \"Our cases have identified a host of fact that can bear on the fairness of such an attribution. We have, for example, held that a challenged activity may be state action when it results from the State's exercise of \"coercive power,\" [?CITATION?] when the State provides \"significant encouragement, either overt or covert,\" ibid., or when a private actor operates as a \"willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents,\" Lugar, supra, at [?CITATION?] (internal quotation marks omitted). We have treated a nominally private entity as a state actor when it is controlled by an \"agency of the State,\" Pennsylvania v Board of Directors of City Trusts of Philadelphia, [?CITATION?] (per incuriam), when it has been delegated a public function by the State, cf., e.g., [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?], when it is \"entwined with governmental policies,\" or when government is \"entwined in [its] management or control,\" [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 180: Amidst such variety, examples may be the best teachers, and examples from our cases are unequivocal in showing that the character of a legal entity is determined neither by its expressly private characterization in statutory law, nor by the failure of the law to acknowledge the entity's inseparability from recognized government officials or agencies\" Thus, seven tests have been laid down for fulfilling the requirements of a public body in becoming a state actor. We, however, may notice that in United States of America a public body would answer the description of a state actor if one or the other tests laid down therein is satisfied on a factual consideration and therefor the cumulative effect of all or some of tests is not required to be taken into consideration.

      "Paragraph 186: It has been argued in this article that the judicial conclusions as to the applicability of the HRA and judicial review in cases of contracting out were neither legally inevitable, nor desirable in normative terms. The contractualisation of government is not a transient phenomenon. It is here to stay for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "Paragraph 187: The courts have in the past developed doctrinal tools to meet challenges posed by changing pattern of government. They should not forget this heritage.\" Craig in his treatise 'Administrative Law' at page 821 also made an interesting observation as regards future prospects, stating :\n",
      "Paragraph 188: \"If the scope of review is extended thus far then careful attention will have to be given to whether the procedural and substantive norms applied against traditional public bodies should also be applied against private bodies.\n",
      "Paragraph 189: Many of the cases within this section are concerned with the application of procedural norms. If we were to follow Lord Woolf's suggestion then we would also have to consider whether substantive public law should be applied to such bodies. Would we insist that sporting bodies with monopoly power, or large companies with similar power, take account of all relevant considerations before deciding upon a course of action? Would we demand that their actions be subject to a principle of proportionality, assuming that it becomes an accepted part of our substantive control? If there is an affirmative answer, then the change would be significant to say the very least. It would have ramifications for other subjects, such as company law, commercial law and contract. It would increase the courts' judicial review case load. It would involve difficult questions as to how such substantive public law principles fit with previously accepted doctrines of private law. This is not to deny that similar broad principles can operate within the public and private spheres. It is to argue that the broader the reach of \"public law\", the more nuanced we would have to be about the application of public law principles to those bodies brought within the ambit of judicial review.\" In an interesting article 'Sports, Policy and Liability of Sporting Administrators' by Jeremy Kirk and Anton Trichardt published in [?CITATION?], the learned authors while analyzing a recent decision of the High Court Rugby players to ask for amendment of the rules of International Rugby Football Board (which was disallowed) opined:\n",
      "Paragraph 190: \"The High Court's decision in Agar is not without its difficulties, but it is well-founded in so far as it established that there is generally no liability in negligence for the creation or amendment of the rules of amateur sports played by adults. Even so, there is still room for argument that sporting administrators will be liable in negligence in relation to the nature and conduct of their sports. It is conceivable that there could be liability for employers in relation to the rules of professional sports. Any type of administrator could be liable for misrepresentations. And liability could potentially arise for failing to fulfil a duty to warn in situations where controllers become aware of new information pointing to a higher level of risk than was generally appreciated.\n",
      "Paragraph 191: It may be that the judgments in Agar, to use the words of Gowans J in Carlton Cricket and Football Social Club v Joseph, \"are not going to be very interesting to those who have more familiarity with the rules of [rugby] football than they have with the rules of law\". Nevertheless, the decision is an important one for sporting administrators.\n",
      "Paragraph 192: What is more, the potential for legal liability to be imposed on sporting administrators has been but partially resolved by the High Court's decision. The ball is, one might say, still in play.\" The opinion of the learned authors to say the least provides a new insight.\n",
      "Paragraph 193: ANALYSIS OF CASE LAW:\n",
      "Paragraph 194: We have noticed hereinbefore that the Courts of Scotland and New Zealand differ with the English and American majority approach.\n",
      "Paragraph 195: The approach of the court as regard judicial review has undergone a sea change even in England after the Human Rights Act, 1998 came into force as doctrine of incompatibility is being applied more frequently even in determining the validity of legislations.\n",
      "Paragraph 196: The English Courts despite their reluctance to exercise power of judicial review over the activities of sports association noticed in the context of Human Rights Act, 1998 that there are public bodies which are hybrid in nature who have functions of public and private nature but they would be public authorities. [See Donoghue (supra)] However, in San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc.(supra) the minority view clearly states that the governmental function of the USOC in that they represent the nation. Justice Blackmun, J. had agreed with the said view.\n",
      "Paragraph 197: The minority view in Jackson (supra) was noticed in Ramana Dayaram Shetty (supra). We agree with the said view.\n",
      "Paragraph 198: It is interesting to note that even English Courts have imposed high standard of fairness in conduct in relation to such bodies in sharp contrast to purely private bodies. As noticed hereinbefore, availability of judicial review has been accepted by the English courts. [See M.C. Mehta (supra)] The right of Indian players, having regard to the observations made in Greig & Ors. (supra) is comparable to their constitutional right contained in Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India which would include a right to work and a right to pursue one's occupation.\n",
      "Paragraph 199: The Board while enjoying monopoly in cricket exercises enormous power which is neither in doubt nor in dispute. Its action may disable a person from pursuing his vocation and in that process subject a citizen to hostile discrimination or impose an embargo which would make or mar a player's career as was in the case of Greig & Ors. (supra). The right to pursue an occupation or the right of equality are embedded in our Constitution whereby citizens of India are granted much higher right as compared to common law right in England. A body although self- regulating, if performs public duty by way of exercise of regulatory machinery, a judicial review would lie against it as was in the case of Datafin (supra). The question has since been considered from a slightly different angle, viz., when such action affects the human right of the person concerned holding that the same would be public function. [See Donoghue (supra)]. If the action of the Board impinges upon the fundamental or other constitutional rights of a citizen or if the same is ultra vires or by reason thereof an injury or material prejudice is caused to its member or a person connected with cricket, judicial review would lie. Such functions on the part of the Board being public function, any violation of or departure or deviation from abiding by the rules and regulation framed by it would be subject to judicial review. Time is not far off when having regard to globalization and privatization the rules of administrative law have to be extended to the private bodies whose functions affect the fundamental rights of a citizen and who wield a great deal of influence in public life.\n",
      "Paragraph 200: PUBLIC FUNCTION AND PUBLIC DUTY:\n",
      "Paragraph 201: Public law is a term of art with definite legal consequences. (See The concept of public law function is yet to be crystalised.\n",
      "Paragraph 202: Concededly, however, the power of judicial review can be exercised by this Court under Article 32 and by the High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution of India only in a case where the dispute involves a public law element as contradistinguished from a private law dispute. (See [?CITATION?]) General view, however, is that whenever a State or an instrumentality of a State is involved, it will be regarded as an issue within the meaning of public law but where individuals are at loggerheads, the remedy therefor has to be resorted in private law filed. Situation, however, changes with the advancement of the State function particularly when it enters in the fields of commerce, industry and business as a result whereof either private bodies take up public functions and duties or they are allowed to do so. The distinction has narrowed down but again concededly such a distinction still exists. Drawing an inspiration from the decisions of this Court as also other courts, it may be safely inferred that when essential governmental functions were placed or allowed to be performed by the private body; they must be held to have undertaken public duty or public functions.\n",
      "Paragraph 203: What would be a public function has succinctly been stated in American Constitutional Law by Laurence H. Tribe at page 1705 in the following terms:\n",
      "Paragraph 204: \"18-5. The \"Public Function\" Cases:\n",
      "Paragraph 205: When the state \"merely\" authorizes a given \"private\" action  imagine a green light at a street corner authorizing pedestrians to cross if they wish  that action cannot automatically become one taken under \"state authority\" in any sense that makes the Constitution applicable. Which authorizations have that Constitution  triggering effect will necessarily turn on the character of the decision-making responsibility thereby placed (or left) in private hands. However described, there must exist a category of responsibilities regarded at any given time as so \"public\" or \"governmental\" that their discharge by private persons, pursuant to state authorization even though not necessarily in accord with state direction, is subject to the federal constitutional norms that would apply to pubic officials discharging those same responsibilities. For example, deciding to cross the street when a police officer says you may is not such a \"public function;\" but authoritatively deciding who is free to cross and who must stop is a \"public function\" whether or not the person entrusted under state law to perform that function wears a police uniform and is paid a salary from state revenues or wears civilian garb and serves as a volunteer crossing guard\" In the instant case, there does not exist any legislation made either by any State or by the Union of India regulating and controlling the cricketing activities in the country. The Board authorized itself to make law regulating cricket in India which it did and which it was allowed to do by the States either overtly or covertly. The States left the decision making responsibility in the hands of the Board, otherwise so-called private hands. They maintain silence despite the Board's proclamation of its authority to make law of sports for the entire country.\n",
      "Paragraph 206: Performance of a public function in the context of the Constitution of India would be to allow an entity to perform the function as an authority within the meaning of Article 12 which makes it subject to the constitutional discipline of fundamental rights. Except in the case of disciplinary measures, the Board has not made any rule to act fairly or reasonably. In its function, the ICC does. Board as a member of ICC or otherwise also is bound to act in a reasonable manner. The duty to act fairly is inherent in body which exercises such enormous power. Such a duty can be envisioned only under Article 14 of the Constitution and not under the Administrative Law. The question of a duty to act fairly under administrative law apart from Article 14 of the Constitution of India, as has been noticed in Ramana Dayaram Shetty (supra) (page 503), would not, thus, arise in the instant case.\n",
      "Paragraph 207: Governmental functions are multifacial. There cannot be a single test for defining public functions. Such functions are performed by variety of means.\n",
      "Paragraph 208: Furthermore, even when public duties are conferred by statute, powers and duties do not thereunder limit the ambit of a statute as there are instances when the conferment of powers involves the imposition of duty to exercise it, or to perform some other incidental act, such as obedience to the principles of natural justice. Many public duties are implied by the courts rather than commanded by the legislature; some can even be said to be assumed voluntarily. Some statutory public duties are 'prescriptive patterns of conduct' in the sense that they are treated as duties to act reasonably so that the prescription in these cases is indeed provided by the courts, not merely recognized by them.\n",
      "Paragraph 209: A.J. Harding in his book 'Public Duties and Public Law' summarized the said definition in the following terms:\n",
      "Paragraph 210: \"1. There is, for certain purposes (particularly for the remedy of mandamus or its equivalent), a distinct body of public law.\n",
      "Paragraph 211: 2\\. Certain bodies are regarded under that law as being amenable to it.\n",
      "Paragraph 212: 3\\. Certain functions of these bodies are regarded under that law as prescribing as opposed to merely permitting certain conduct.\n",
      "Paragraph 213: 4\\. These prescriptions are public duties.\" In Donoghue (supra), it is stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 214: \"58. We agree with Mr. Luba's submissions that the definition of who is a public authority, and what is a public function, for the purposes of s 6 of the 1998 Act, should be given a generous interpretation\" There are, however, public duties which arise from sources other than a statute. These duties may be more important than they are often thought to be or perceived. Such public duties may arise by reason of (i) Prerogative, (ii) Franchise and (iii) Charter. All the duties in each of the categories are regarded as relevant in several cases. (See A.J. Harding's Public Duties and Public Law, Pages 6 to 14) The functions of the Board, thus, having regard to its nature and character of functions would be public functions.\n",
      "Paragraph 215: AUTHORITY:\n",
      "Paragraph 216: All public and statutory authorities are authorities. But an authority in its etymological sense need not be a statutory or public authority. Public authorities have public duties to perform.\n",
      "Paragraph 217: In Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley Parochial Church albeit in the context of Human Rights Act, 1998, it was held:\n",
      "Paragraph 218: \"This feature, that a core public authority is incapable of having Convention rights of its own, is a matter to be borne in mind when considering whether or not a particular body is a core public authority.\" [?CITATION?] and Parochial Church Council of the There, however, exists a distinction between a statutory authority and a public authority. A writ not only lies against a statutory authority, it will also be maintainable against any person and a body discharging public function who is performing duties under a statute. A body discharging public functions and exercising monopoly power would also be an authority and, thus, writ may also lie against it.\n",
      "Paragraph 219: JUDICIAL REVIEW UDNER ARTICLES 32 & 226 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA :\n",
      "Paragraph 220: Judicial Review forms basic structure of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 221: It is inalienable. Public law remedy by way of judicial review is available both under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. They do not operate in different fields. Article 226 operates only on a broader horizon.\n",

Having regard to the discussions made therein, probably it was not necessary for us to consider the question in depth but its reluctance to determine as to whether the Board is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution necessitates further and deeper probe.\n",

It has jurisdiction to issue such writs to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any Government within its territorial jurisdiction, directions, orders or writs specified therein for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose. Article 226 confers an extensive jurisdiction to the High Court vis-`-vis this Court under Article 32 in the sense that writs issued by it may run to any person and for purposes other than enforcement of any rights conferred by Part III but having regard to the term 'authority' which is used both under Article 226 and Article 12, we have our own doubts as to whether any distinction in [?CITATION?] This aspect of the matter has been considered in Andi Mukta Sadguru (supra). It has clearly been stated that a writ petition would be maintainable against other persons or bodies who perform public duty. The nature of duty imposed on the body would be highly relevant for the said purpose. Such type of duty must be judged in the light of the positive obligation owed by a person or authority to be the affected party.\n",

      "Paragraph 231: The recent development in the field of judicial review vis-`-vis human rights also deserves a mention, although in this case, we are not directly concerned therewith.\n",
      "Paragraph 232: noticed that Article 13 of Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms envisages constitution of forums where complaint of violation of human rights can be adjudicated. No such forum was provided for before enactment of Human Rights Act, 1998. A policy decision adopted in the year 1993 by the British Government that more planes will land in Heathrow Airport during night led to filing of a complaint by the nearby residents alleging violation of their right of privacy but judicial review was denied to them on the ground that the same was a policy decision. The European Court of Human Rights, however, observed that prior to coming into force of the Human Rights Act, 1998 the Government failed to provide a forum for adjudication of violation of human rights. The petitioners therein were held entitled to compensation in view of Article 13 of Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n",

Both reflect the commitment of the people to promote freedom, the well-being and dignity of individuals in society. Human development as a human right has a direct nexus with the increase in capabilities of human beings as also the range of things they can do. Human development is eventually in the interest of society and on a larger canvas, it is in the national interest also.

      "Paragraph 238: The traditional tests which had impelled this Court to lay down the tests for determining the question as to whether a body comes within the purview of \"Other Authorities\" in Ajay Hasia (supra), inter alia are :\n",
      "Paragraph 239: \" (3) It may also be a relevant factor ... whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State- conferred or State-protected.\n",
      "Paragraph 240: (5) If the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely related to governmental functions, it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation as an instrumentality or agency of Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 241: The six tests laid down there are not exhaustive.\n",
      "Paragraph 242: We in this case, moreover, are required to proceed on the premise that some other tests had also been propounded by Mathew, J. in Sukhdev Singh (supra), wherein it was observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 243: \"The growing power of the industrial giants, of the labour unions and of certain other organized groups, compels a reassessment of the relation between group power and the modern State on the one hand and the freedom of the individual on the other. The corporate organisations of business and labour have long ceased to be private phenomena.\" (Emphasis supplied) The learned Judge stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 244: \"The governing power wherever located must be subject to the fundamental constitutional limitations. The need to subject the power centers to the control of Constitution requires an expansion of the concept of State action.\" \"Although private in the property sense, it was public in the functional sense. The substance of the doctrine there laid down is that where a corporation is privately performing a 'public function' it is held to the constitutional standards regarding civil rights and equal protection of the laws that apply to the State itself. The Court held that administration of private property of such a town, though privately carried on, was, nevertheless, in the nature of a 'public function', that the private rights of the corporation must therefore be exercised within constitutional limitations, and the conviction for trespass was reversed.\" Referring to Article 13(2), it was held:\n",
      "Paragraph 245: \"In other words, it is against state action that fundamental rights are guaranteed. Wrongful individual acts unsupported by State authority in the shape of laws, customs, or judicial or executive proceedings are not prohibited.\" As regards public function tests, it was held:\n",
      "Paragraph 246: \"Another factor which might be considered is whether the operation is an important public function. The combination of State aid and the furnishing of an important public service may result in a conclusion that the operation should be classified as a State agency. If a given function is of such public importance and so closely related to governmental functions as to be classified as a governmental agency, then even the presence or absence of State financial aid might be irrelevant in making a finding of State action. If the function does not fall within such a description, then mere addition of State money would not influence the conclusion.\" Conversely put, if the functions of the body falls within the description of the public function, absence of State financial aid would not influence the conclusion to the contrary. As regards, governmental aid, it was noticed:\n",
      "Paragraph 247: \"The State may aid a private operation in various ways other than by direct financial assistance. It may give the organization the power of eminent domain, it may grant tax exemptions, or it may give it a monopolistic status for certain purposes.\" The legal position in America in this behalf was also noticed in the following terms:\n",
      "Paragraph 248: \"In America, corporations or associations, private in character, but dealing with public rights, have already been held subject to constitutional standards. Political parties, for example, even though they are not statutory organisations, and are in form private clubs, are within this category. So also are labour unions on which statutes confer the right of collective bargaining.\" (Emphasis supplied) Drawing the contrast between the governmental activities which are private and private activities which are governmental, Mathew, J. noticed that besides the so-called traditional functions, the modern State operates a multitude of public enterprises. What is, therefore, relevant and material is the nature of the function.\n",
      "Paragraph 249: In our view, the complex problem has to be resolved keeping in view the following further tests :\n",
      "Paragraph 250: i) When the body acts as a public authority and has a public duty to perform;\n",
      "Paragraph 251: (ii) When it is bound to protect human rights.\n",
      "Paragraph 252: (iii) When it regulates a profession or vocation of a citizen which is otherwise a fundamental right under a statute or its own rule..\n",
      "Paragraph 253: (iv) When it regulates the right of a citizen contained in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India available to the general public and viewers of the game of cricket in particular.\n",
      "Paragraph 254: (v) When it exercises a de facto or a de jure monopoly;\n",
      "Paragraph 255: (vi) When the State out-sources its legislative power in its favour;\n",
      "Paragraph 256: (vii) When it has a positive obligation of public nature.\n",
      "Paragraph 257: These tests as such had not been considered independently in any other decision of this Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 258: We, thus, would have to proceed to determine the knotty issues involved therein on a clean slate.\n",
      "Paragraph 259: These traditional tests of a body controlled financially, functionally and administratively by the Government as laid down in Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra) would have application only when a body is created by the State itself for different purposes but incorporated under the Indian Companies Act or Societies Registration Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 260: Those tests may not be applicable in a case where the body like the Board was established as a private body long time back. It was allowed by the State to represent the State or the country in international fora. It became a representative body of the international organizations as representing the country. When the nature of function of such a body becomes such that having regard to the enormity thereof it acquires the status of monopoly for all practical purposes; regulates and control the fundamental rights of a citizen as regard their right of speech or right of occupation, becomes representative of the country either overtly or covertly and has a final say in the matter of registration of players, umpires and other connecting with a very popular sport. The organizers of competitive test cricket between one association and another or representing different States or different organizations having the status of a state are allowed to make laws on the subject which is essentially a State function in terms of Entry 33 List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. In such a case, different tests have to be applied.\n",
      "Paragraph 261: The question in such cases may, moreover, have to be considered as to whether it enjoys the State patronage as a national federation by the Central Government; whether in certain matters a joint action is taken by the body in question and the Central Government; its nexus with the Governments or its bodies, its functions vis-`-vis the citizens of the country, its activities vis-`- vis the government of the country and the national interest/ importance given to the sport of cricket in the country. The tests, thus, which would be applicable are coercion test, joint action test, public function test, entertainment test, nexus test, supplemental governmental activity test and the importance of the sport test.\n",
      "Paragraph 262: An entity or organization constituting a State for the purpose of Part III of the Constitution would not necessarily continue to be so for all times to come. Converse is also true. A body or an organization although created for a private purpose by reason of extension of its activities may not only start performing governmental functions but also may become a hybrid body and continue to act both in its private capacity or as public capacity. What is necessary to answer the question would be to consider the host of factors and not just a single factor. The presence or absence of a particular element would not be determinative of the issue, if on an overall consideration it becomes apparent that functionally it is an authority within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 263: Similarly significant funding by the Government may not by itself make a body a State, if its functions are entirely private in character.\n",
      "Paragraph 264: Conversely absence of funding for the functioning of the body or the organization would not deny it from its status of a State; if its functions are public functions and if it otherwise answers the description of \"Other Authorities\". The Government aid may not be confined only by way of monetary grant. It may take various forms, e.g., tax exemptions, minimal rent for a stadia and recognition by the State, etc. An over emphasis of the absence of the funding by the State is not called for.\n",
      "Paragraph 265: It is true that regulatory measures applicable to all the persons similarly situated, in terms of the provisions of a statute would by itself not make an organization a State in all circumstances. Conversely, in a case of this nature non-interference in the functioning of an autonomous body by the Government by itself may also not be a determinative factor as the Government may not consider any need therefor despite the fact that the body or organization had been discharging essentially a public function.\n",
      "Paragraph 266: Such non-interference would not make the public body a private body.\n",
      "Paragraph 267: WHAT CRICKET MEANS TO INDIA:\n",
      "Paragraph 268: We have laid down the tests aforesaid and the approach which needs to be adopted in determining the issue as to whether the Board is a State or not.

      "Paragraph 269: Cricket in India is the most popular game. When India plays in international fora, it attracts the attention of millions of people. The win or loss of the game brings 'joy' or 'sorrow' to them. To some lovers of the game, it is a passion, to a lot more it is an obsession, nay a craze.

The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports issued the revised guidelines and forwarded the same to the Presidents/Secretary General, Indian Olympic Association and the Presidents/Hony. General Secretaries of all recognized Sports Federations incorporating therein the amended provisions. Cricket is included in Annexure-I within the category [Others (C)].\n",
      "Paragraph 316: While issuing the Guidelines, it has been asserted that the Government attaches considerable importance to development of sports in general and achieving excellence in the Olympics and other international events in particular, as also the unsatisfactory performance of the Indian Team(s) in important international sports events. It was recorded that over the years the Government had been actively supporting the National Sports Federations in the matter of development of specific games/sports discipline.\n",
      "Paragraph 317: The objective of the said guidelines was to define the areas of responsibility of various agencies involved in the promotion and development of sports, to identify National Sports Federations eligible for coverage thereunder and to state the conditions for eligibility which the Government would insist upon while releasing grants to Sports Federations.\n",
      "Paragraph 318: Para III speaks of role and responsibility of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, National Sports Federations and the Sports Authority. Para IV provides for priority sports which have been categorized as : (a) 'Priority', (b) 'General Category' and (c) 'Other Category'. Para 8 refers to grants given to National Federations under different sub-heads.

      "Paragraph 319: Para 9 provides for clubbing and dovetailing of schemes of SAI and the Ministry. Para XI provides for long term development plans. Para XII deals with miscellaneous matters.\n",
      "Paragraph 320: Annexure-II appended to the said guidelines provides for recognition of National Sports Federations, inter alia, by laying down the eligibility therefor and the necessity of filing of applications in that behalf. Clause 3.12 reads as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 321: \"There would be only one recognized Federation for each discipline of sport, irrespective of the fact that the particular sport caters to youngsters, men, women or veterans. However, this condition shall not apply to Federations already recognized by the Department.\" Clause 5 provides for grant of recognition. Annexure-III appended to the said guidelines provides for the procedure for suspension/withdrawal of recognition and consequences thereof. The said guidelines also prescribe forms required to be used by the federations for different purposes.\n",
      "Paragraph 322: The Board for all intent and purport was a recognized body. Probably in that view of the matter, the Board did not think it necessary to apply for grant of such recognition of the Union of India asking it for passing a formal order. However, the Board had all along been obtaining the requisite permission for sending an Indian team abroad or for inviting a foreign team in India in the prescribed form.\n",
      "Paragraph 323: EXPRESS RECOGNITION  ESSENTIAL? Union of India has issued certain guidelines evidently in exercise of its power conferred on it under Article 73 of the Constitution of India for regulating sports in India. The said guidelines have been issued having regard to objects it sought to achieve including the poor performance of Indian Team abroad. The said guidelines have been moreover issued in exercise of its control over the National Sports Federations. The sport of Cricket was not included within the said guidelines. Both mens' and womens' cricket had been brought within the purview of the said guidelines in the year 2001. They provide for grant of recognition. The Board contends that it had never applied for recognition nor had it asked for financial aid or grant of any other benefit. Factually the Union of India has not been able to controvert this position although in its affidavit affirmed by a Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, it has stated that Board is a recognized National Federation. It is true that no document has been produced establishing grant of such recognition; but in its additional affidavit affirmed by Mrs. Devpreet A.\n",
      "Paragraph 324: Singh, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, a number of documents have been annexed which clearly go to show that from the very beginning the Board had been asking for permission of the Ministry of Human Resource Development either to go abroad or to play or participate in other countries or for inviting the others to play in India. Such permission had been sought for in the form prescribed in terms of the said regulations. The said documents leave no manner of doubt that the Board had asked for and the Union of India had granted de facto recognition.\n",
      "Paragraph 325: In the affidavit dated 8th October, 2004 affirmed by a Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, it is stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 326: \"1. I am informed that this Hon'ble Court required to be apprised as to whether it was mandatory for all sporting bodies including private entities or clubs to seek permission and to obtain the same for playing in tournaments abroad.\n",
      "Paragraph 327: 2\\. In response to the issue raised before this Hon'ble Court, it is respectfully submitted that only the recognized National Sports Federations are required to apply in the prescribed format for seeking permission to go abroad to play as a Team representing India. There have been instances where club teams, organizations engaged in sports activities etc. have applied for such permission but the Ministry has considered their request only when they were received through the National Sports Federation  BCCI in this case.\" It is not disputed that the Union of India has not recognized any other national sports body for regulating the game of cricket in India. It is the categorical stand of the Union of India that only by such recognition granted by the Union of India, the team selected by the Board is the Indian cricket team which it could not do in absence thereof. We cannot accept the submission of Mr. Venugopal to the effect that even while playing abroad, the Board sends its own team. It is evident from the records which fact has also been noticed by the Delhi High Court in its judgment in Rahul Mehra (supra) that the Board fields its team as Indian Team and not as Board Eleven, which without having any authority from the Union of India, it will not be able to do. The stand that the cricket team selected by the Board only represents it and not the country is incorrect. Having regard to the rules of the ICC, its own rules as also various documents placed before this Court by the Union of India, the conduct of both the Board and the Union of India clearly go to show that sub silentio both the parties had been acting on the premise that the Board is recognized as the only recognized National Federation for the purpose of regulating the game of cricket in India.\n",
      "Paragraph 328: BOARD A STATE? The Board is a society registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 329: It is not created under a Statute but it is an acknowledged fact that in terms of its Memorandum of Association and rules framed by it, it has not only the monopoly status as regard the regulation of the game of cricket but also can lay down the criteria for its membership and furthermore make the law of sport of cricket. The Board for all intent and purport is a recognized national federation recognized by the Union of India. By reason of said recognition only, an enormous power is exercised by the second Respondent which from selection and preparation of players at the grass root level to organize Daleep Trophy, Ranji Trophy etc. select teams and umpires for international events. The players selected by the second Respondent represent India as their citizen. They use the national colour in their attire. The team is known as Indian team. It is recognized as such by the ICC. For all intent and purport it exercises the monopoly.\n",
      "Paragraph 330: The Board is in a position to expend crores of rupees from its own earnings. The tender in question would show that what sort of amount is involved in distributing its telecasting right for a period of four years, inasmuch as both the First Petitioner and the Fifth Respondent offered US $ 308 millions therefor.\n",
      "Paragraph 331: A monopoly status need not always be created by a law within the meaning of clauses 2 to 6 of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 332: A body which carries on the monopolistic function of selecting team to represent the nation and whose core function is to promote a sport that has become a symbol of national identity and a medium of expression of national pride, must be held to be carrying out governmental functions. A highly arbitrary or capricious action on the part of such a powerful body would attract the wrath of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The Board itself acted as a representative of the Government of India before the international community. It makes representations to the effect that it was entitled to select a team which represents the nation as a cricket playing country, and, thus, the same would, without anything more, make its action a State action. For the said purpose, actual control of the Board or issuing any direction in that behalf by the Government of India is not of much significance but the question as to whether the Government, considering the facts and circumstances, should control the actions of the Board as long as it purports to select a team to represent India would be a matter of great significance. The guidelines issued by the Union of India clearly demonstrate its concern with the fall in standard of Indian Team in sports in important international sports events. It would not be correct to draw a comparison between an event of international sport as significant as cricket with beauty pageants and other such events as the test necessary to be evolved in this behalf is the qualitative test and not the quantitative test. The quality and character of a sport recognized as a measure of education and nation building (as a facet of human resources development) cannot be confused with an event that may be a form of entertainment. Cricket, as noticed hereinbefore, has a special place in the hearts of citizens of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 333: The monopoly status of the Board is undisputed. The monopoly enjoyed by the Board need not be a statutory one so as to conform to the tests contained in Clause (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution. It can be a de facto monopoly which has overtly or covertly received the blessings of Union of India. The de facto monopoly of the Board is manifest as it, as a member of ICC (even if it is technically possible to float any other association), can send an Indian Team abroad or invite a foreign team onto India. In absence of recognition from the ICC, it would not be possible for any other body including the Union of India to represent India in the international Cricket events featuring competitive cricket.\n",
      "Paragraph 334: So would be the position in domestic cricket. The Board in view of enormity of powers is bound to follow \"the doctrine of fairness and good faith in all its activities\". [See Board of Control for Cricket, India & Anr.\n",
      "Paragraph 335: The object of Part III of our Constitution is to curtail abuse of power and if by reason of the Board's activities, fairness in action is expected, it would answer the description of \"Other Authorities\".\n",
      "Paragraph 336: The decisions rendered in different jurisdictions including those of this Court clearly suggest that a body like the Board would come within the purview of the expression \"Other Authorities\" contained in Article 12 of the Constitution of India. For the said purpose, a complete new look must be bestowed on the functions and structures of the Board. A public authority, in my opinion, would be an authority which not only can regulate and control the entire sports activities in relation to cricket but also the decisive character it plays in formulating the game in all aspects. Even the Federations controlled by the State and other public bodies as also the State themselves, in view of the Board's Memorandum of Association and the Rules and Regulations framed by it, are under its complete control. Thus, it would be subject to a judicial review.\n",
      "Paragraph 337: The history of ICC has been noticed by the Court of Appeal in Greig (supra) and, thus, it may not be necessary to retrace it over again.\n",
      "Paragraph 338: It is not disputed that the Government in terms of its guidelines recognizes only the Board. Its recognition whether formal or informal is evident as both the Union of India and the Board proceeded on that basis. In international arena the regulated cricket is also known as official cricket.\n",
      "Paragraph 339: The rules of the ICC suggest that a domicile of one country can play in county clubs but only citizens or other persons who come within the purview of the said rules must play for their country in test or other official matches in terms of the ICC Rules. The tournaments are held between the countries and at the domestic level between States/regions and the other clubs over which the Board has an exclusive and complete control. In the international level, the ICC recognizes the national federations only who are its members having regard to the fact that these federations either represent a country or a geographical area. The very fact that recognition of ICC has been extended to a geographical area (as for example, the West Indies comprising of so many countries), goes to show that for the said purpose the consensus amongst various bodies and several nations is necessary.\n",
      "Paragraph 340: It is true that a country as such is not a member of ICC and in some places of the Rules for the purpose of election of the President, the country is represented through its national federation which is its full time member. It is furthermore true that the ICC Rules refer as a nation not only a 'country' but also a geographical area covering several countries but a bare perusal of the rules in its entirety would clearly go to show that only those national federations which represent the country can become its whole time or associate members. The expression \"country\" has been used at numerous places. It is one thing to say that legally it is permissible to make a Club a member but unless it has the national patronage, it is inconceivable that it can obtain membership of ICC in any capacity. Theoretically in the ICC, the Board is a member but it without State patronage directly or indirectly would reduce its activities. In case any other body is recognized by the Union of India, it would not be entitled to regulate the sport of cricket in India. Perforce it has to abandon its functions outside the country.\n",
      "Paragraph 341: In the Rules framed by the ICC, the principles of natural justice containing elements (a) the right to a fair hearing; and (b) the rule against bias has been specifically provided for. These are in keeping with the function of public body and not private body. But, so far as the rules framed by the Board are concerned, the principles of natural justice are required to be followed only in the event a disciplinary action is contemplated and not otherwise.\n",
      "Paragraph 342: The submission of Mr. Venugopal that Union of India having made a categorical statement before the Parliament as also in its affidavit in the case of Rahul Mehra (supra) before the High Court of Delhi wherein it is accepted that the Board is not under the control of the Union of India nor there exist any statutory rules to regulate its functioning and further the issues raised in the said writ petition relate to the internal functioning of the Board, which is autonomous in its function, having regard to the materials on record may not be of much significance. We must moreover notice that the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports in an answer to the Parliament also stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 343: \"The promotion of the game of cricket in the country is the responsibility of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) which is an autonomous organization.\" Such responsibility on its part makes it a State actor.\n",
      "Paragraph 344: When a query was made from the Board to give reply to a starred question dated 11.12.2001, the Board in its letter dated 13.05.2003 replied as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 345: \"We would like to reiterate that the Annual Reports of BCCI are already available with your Ministry.\" The tenor of the letter, thus, runs contrary to the assertion of the Board that it has never sent its accounts to the Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 346: It is accepted by the Union of India that the Board is an autonomous organization and the Government of India does not hold any cricket match series as it is the function of the Board, but that is all the more reason as to why it has its own responsibilities towards officials, players, umpires, coaches, administrators and above all the cricket loving public.\n",
      "Paragraph 347: However, we may place on record that there are a number of documents filed by the Union of India which clearly go to show that either for sending Indian Team abroad or inviting a foreign team on the soil of India, the Board has invariably been taking permission from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. In the counter affidavit filed before the Bombay High Court, the Board raised a contention that it seeks permission of the Union of India for obtaining visas, foreign exchange and matters connected therewith; but the said contention cannot be accepted in view of the fact that had the same been the position, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (which has nothing to do in these matters), would not have been approached therefor and that too in the form prescribed in the guidelines.\n",
      "Paragraph 348: The Board's activities representing the country is not confined to international forums only. The Board within the country organizes and conducts the Ranji Trophy, the Irani Trophy, the Duleep Singh Trophy, the Deodar Trophy and the NKP Salve Challenge Trophy. Although, there are domestic events, indisputably only those who are members of the Board and/or recognized by it can take part therein and none else. This also goes to show that the Board regulates the domestic competitive cricket to the fullest measure and exercises control over its members which represents the five zones in India. All the States Federations besides a few other clubs which are its members, two of which it will bear repetition to state, are governmental organizations.\n",
      "Paragraph 349: Indisputably the Board is a regulator of cricket played at the country level both off and on the fields including selection of players and umpires.\n",
      "Paragraph 350: ICC possesses and exercises all the powers to regulate international competitive cricket. It exercises disciplinary power also as in case of violation of the rules, a country member or the player may be derecognized.\n",
      "Paragraph 351: The ICC exercises a monopoly over the sports at the international level whereas Board does so at the country level. It is the Board only, to the exclusion of all others, that can recognize bodies who are entitled to participate in the nominated tournaments. Players and umpires also must be registered with it. In the event of violation of its rules and regulations, which may include participation in an unauthorized tournaments without its permission, a player or umpire would forfeit his right to participate in all official cricket matches which for all intent and purport shall be the end of career of a professional cricketer or umpire.\n",
      "Paragraph 352: In our constitutional scheme rule of law would, by all means, prevail over rule of cricket. A body regulating the game of cricket would be compelled by the court to abide by rule of law.\n",
      "Paragraph 353: The hallowness of the claim of the Board that its players play for it and not for India is belied by the claim of the former players who categorically stated that they have played for India and not for the Board.\n",
      "Paragraph 354: Whenever players play for the Board, the Team is named as Board-Eleven.\n",
      "Paragraph 355: [See 'The Times of India'  October24, 2004 and 'Hindustan Times'  October 24, 2004]. It undertakes activities of entering into contracts for telecasting and broadcasting rights as also advertisements in the stadia.\n",
      "Paragraph 356: While considering the status of the Board vis-`-vis Article 12 of the Constitution of India, the Central Government's reluctance to interfere with its day to day affairs or allowing it to work as an autonomous body, non- assistance in terms of money or the administrative control thereover may not be of much relevance as it was not only given de facto recognition but also it is aided, facilitated or supported in all other respects by it.\n",
      "Paragraph 357: It would not be correct to contend that a monopoly status upon a body must be conferred either by way of statute or by the State by issuing an appropriate order in that behalf. The question as regard exercise of monopoly power by the Board of must be determined having regard to the ground realities i.e. it not only represents the country but also controls and regulates the entire field of competitive cricket.\n",
      "Paragraph 358: Despite the fact that the relationship between the Board and the players is not that of an employer and employee, but the players are within its complete control. Sports activities of the countries being not a commercial activity, as has been held in Cricket Association of Bengal (supra), the same must be considered from a larger spectrum of the Indian citizenary as a whole.\n",
      "Paragraph 359: It is not disputed that as of now except the Board there is no other authority in the field. The rules framed by the Board do not spell out as to how without virtual recognition of the Union of India as also the patronage of States whether de facto or de jure it could become a national federation and how it could become a member of the ICC. It does not furthermore disclose as to how it could having regard to its professed function as a private club, could grant to itself enormous powers as are replete in its rules and regulations. Rules and regulations framed by the Board speak out for themselves as to how it represents Indian cricket team and regulates almost all the activities pertaining thereto. It also legislates law of sports in India in the field of competitive cricket. There is no area which is beyond of the control and regulation of the Board. Every young person who thinks of playing cricket either for a State or a Zone or India must as of necessity be a member of the Board or its members and if he intends to play with another organization, it must obtain its permission so as to enable him or continue to participate in the official matches. The professionals devote their life for playing cricket. The Board's activities may impinge on the fundamental rights of citizens.\n",
      "Paragraph 360: There is no gainsaying that there is no organization in the world other than the ICC at the international level and the Board at the national level that control the game of first class cricket. It has, thus, enormous power and wields great influence over the entire field of cricket. Cricket when it comes to competitive matches no longer remains a mere entertainment  it commands such a wide public interest. It is now recognized that game of cricket as an activity gives a sense of identity and pride to a nation.\n",
      "Paragraph 361: Legal meaning attributed to the wordings of the Article 12 would lead to the conclusion that the Board is a State. It is true that while developing the law operating in the field a strict meaning was not adhered to by this Court but it may not now be possible to put the clock back. We must remind ourselves that if Article 12 is subjected to strict constructions as was sought to be canvassed by Lahoti, J. in his minority opinion in Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra), the same would give way to the majority opinion.\n",
      "Paragraph 362: In sum, the control of the Board over the sport of competitive cricket is deep and pervasive, nay complete.\n",
      "Paragraph 363: The word 'control' has been defined in Black's Law Dictionary in the following terms:\n",
      "Paragraph 364: \"Control-power or authority to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern, administer, oversee.\" In [?CITATION?], Dixon, J., observed that the word 'control' is 'an unfortunate word of such wide and ambiguous import that it has been taken to mean something weaker than 'restraint', something equivalent to 'regulation'. Having regard to the purport and object of activities of the Board, its control over 'cricket' must be held to be of wide amplitude.\n",
      "Paragraph 365: It is not correct that the Board represents itself in international area.\n",
      "Paragraph 366: If it represents the country, indisputably it must have the implied sanction of the Government of India to do so. Its activities, thus, have so far- reaching effect .\n",
      "Paragraph 367: The Union of India has since filed affidavits categorically stating that the Board is a 'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. It has further been stated that not only the Board is recognized de facto but it had all along been seeking permission for going abroad from the Ministry of Human Resource Development (Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports).\n",
      "Paragraph 368: The players who participate in the competitive cricket whether domestic or international are not amateurs; but professionals. They play on receipt of remuneration therefor and furthermore make a lot of earnings by way of advertisements. They participate in the game for a purpose.\n",
      "Paragraph 369: The Board's commands bind all who are connected with cricket. The rules and regulations framed by it for all intent and purport are \"the code\" which regulate an important aspect of national life. Such codes on the premise whereof the Board has been permitted by all concerned including the Union of India and the States to operate so as to regulate and control not only the sport of cricket as such but also all other intimately connected therewith and in particular the professionals.\n",
      "Paragraph 370: It is not in dispute that the players wear national colours in their attires and it also appears from the correspondences that the Board drew the attention to the Government of India that the players to show their pride of being Indian also exhibit Ashok Chakra on their helmets.\n",
      "Paragraph 371: [?CITATION?] this Court as regard right of a citizen to fly the Indian National Flag observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 372: \"14. National Flags are intended to project the identity of the country. They represent and foster national spirit.\n",
      "Paragraph 373: Their distinctive designs and colours embody each nation's particular character and proclaim the country's separate existence. Thus it is veritably common to all nations that a national flag has a great amount of significance\" The State had been taking on more and more sports related activities and thus courts have examined the purport and ambit of activities of such bodies keeping in view wider and wider range of measures the executive and the Central Government adopt.\n",
      "Paragraph 374: The Board, having regard to its functions and object, had also been granted exemption from payment of Income-tax. Such exemption has been granted with a view to fulfill its objectives to promote sports of cricket.\n",
      "Paragraph 375: The Board, thus, in terms of ICC Rules, is representative of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 376: The membership although is in the name of the Board; it is the country which matters. It may be that when the Board and the ICC were constituted the concept was that the game of cricket would be played by clubs but with the passage of time, the concept has undergone a sea change. In any event, the ICC does not say that it does not recognize the country and merely recognizes the clubs.\n",
      "Paragraph 377: The Board (although such a contention has not been raised in any affidavit but in the written submissions only) allegedly spends crores of rupees in providing funds to construction of stadia, running zonal cricket academies under national cricket academy, providing the State Associations with modern gymnasium equipments, medical expenses of the players, pension scheme and expenditure on coaches, physiotherapists, trainers, etc., but it is not disputed that it earns a lot of revenue through sale of tickets, advertisements in the stadia, selling of advertisement in the electronic media, giving out contracts by way of food stalls and installation of other stalls, selling of broadcasting and telecast rights, highlight programmes. The Board is admittedly not a charitable trust.\n",
      "Paragraph 378: The State legislature as also the Parliament have the legislative competence to make legislation in respect of sports, but no such legislation has yet seen the light of the day. We have noticed hereinbefore that the Board in terms of its Memorandum of Association as also rules and regulations framed by it is entitled to make laws for Cricket in India. The States and the Union of India despite knowledge did not object thereto.\n",
      "Paragraph 379: They, thus, made themselves bound by the said Rules and Regulations. In that sense, exercise of law making power contemplated by legislation has been outsourced to the Board.\n",
      "Paragraph 380: The Board which represents a nation with or without a statutory flavour has duties to perform towards the players, coaches, umpires, administrators and other team officials. They have a duty to create safe rules for the sport, if by reason thereof a physical injury to the player is to be avoided and to keep safety aspect under ongoing review. A body may be autonomous but with autonomy comes responsibility. Sport is a \"good thing\" wherefor a societal end is to be provided. Sport must receive encouragement from the State and the general public or at least not discouraged. Health, sociability and play are considered to be important values to be recognized in a human.\n",
      "Paragraph 381: Encouragement of games and sports in terms of Entry 33 of the State List and Entries 45 and 97 of the Union List is a State function. We have noticed the main objects of the Board which are to promote, control, regulate, make laws for the country and encourage the game of cricket. The Union of India or the respective Governments of the States in stead and place of making a legislation have thought it fit to allow the sports bodies to grow from its grass-root level by applying the reverse pyramid rules and by encouraging all associations and federations from village level to national level. We have seen that whereas in each State there is a State federation, they must as of practice or precedent become a member of the Board. State Federations and some other organizations essentially having regard to their respective nature of functions only are members of the Board. They include Association of Indian Universities, Railway Sports Control Board and Services Sports Control Board.\n",
      "Paragraph 382: Furthermore, having regard to the nature of activities, viz., the Board represents a sovereign country while selecting and fielding a team for the country with another sovereign country promoting and aiming at good relations with the said country as also peace and prosperity for the people, even at the domestic level the citizens of the said country may be held to be entitled to the right to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court even if thereby no personal fundamental right is directly infringed.\n",
      "Paragraph 383: With the opening up of economy and globalization, more and more governmental functions are being performed and allowed to be performed by private bodies. When the functions of a body are identifiable with the State functions, they would be State actors only in relation thereto.\n",
      "Paragraph 384: An authority necessarily need not be a creature of the statute. The powers enjoyed and duties attached to the Board need not directly flow from a statute. The Board may not be subjected to a statutory control or enjoy any statutory power but the source of power exercised by them may be traced to the legislative entries and if the rules and regulations evolved by it are akin thereto, its actions would be State actions. For the said purpose, what is necessary is to find out as to whether by reason of its nature of activities, the functions of the Board are public functions. It regulates and controls the field of cricket to the exclusion of others. Its activities impinge upon the fundamental rights of the players and other persons as also the rights, hopes and aspirations of the cricket loving public. The right to see the game of cricket live or on television also forms an important facet of the Board. A body which makes a law for the sports in India (which otherwise is the function of the State), conferring upon itself not only enormous powers but also final say in the disciplinary matter and, thus, being responsible for making or marring a citizen's sports career, it would be an authority which answers the description of \"other authorities\".\n",
      "Paragraph 385: The Board, it appears, even nominates cricketers for the Arjuna Awards.\n",
      "Paragraph 386: The game of cricket both in the domestic fora as also the international fora cannot reach the desired results unless the Board acts in terms of the governmental policies or the government is entwined in its management or control of the Board or any of its agencies  statutory or otherwise. Apart from the above, the other tests laid down in Brentwood Academy (supra), viz., \"willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents\", in our opinion, would make the Board as a State actor.\n",
      "Paragraph 387: The activities undertaken by the Board were taken note of in the case of Cricket Association of Bengal (supra). Therein this Court inter alia rejected the contention of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that the activities of the Association was a commercial one and it had been claiming a commercial right to exploit the sporting event as they did not have the right to telecast the sporting event through an agency of their choice in the following terms:\n",
      "Paragraph 388: \"We have pointed out that that argument is not factually correct and what in fact the BCCI/CAB is asserting is a right under Article 19(1)(a). While asserting the said right, it is incidentally going to earn some revenue. In the circumstances, it has the right to choose the best method to earn the maximum revenue possible. In fact, it can be accused of negligence and may be attributed improper motives, if it fails to explore the most profitable avenue of telecasting the event, when in any case, in achieving the object of promoting and popularizing the sport, it has to endeavour to telecast the cricket matches.\" The aforementioned findings pose a question. Could this Court arrive at such a finding, had it not been for the fact that the association exercises enormous power or it is a 'State' within the meaning of Article 12. If Cricket Association of Bengal (supra) was considered to be a pure private body where was the occasion for this Court to say that 'if it fails to explore the most profitable avenue of telecasting the event whereby it would achieve the object of promoting and popularizing the sport, it may be accused of negligence and may be attributed improper motives?' Applying the tests laid down hereinbefore to the facts of the present case, the Board, in our considered opinion, said description. It discharges a public function. It has its duties towards the public. The public at large will look forward to the Board for selection of the best team to represent the country. It must manage its housekeeping in such a manner so as to fulfill the hopes and aspirations of millions. It has, thus, a duty to act fairly. It cannot act arbitrarily, whimsically or capriciously. Public interest is, thus, involved in the activities of the Board. It is, thus, a State actor.\n",
      "Paragraph 389: We, therefore, are of the opinion that law requires to be expanded in this field and it must be held that the Board answers the description of \"Other Authorities\" as contained in Article 12 of the Constitution of India and satisfies the requisite legal tests, as noticed hereinbefore. It would, therefore, be a 'State'.\n",
      "Paragraph 390: PRECEDENT:\n",
      "Paragraph 391: Are we bound hands and feet by Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra)? The answer to the question must be found in the law of precedent. A decision, it is trite, should not be read as a statute. A decision is an authority for the questions of law determined by it. Such a question is determined having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein. While applying the ratio, the court may not pick out a word or a sentence from the judgment divorced from the context in which the said question arose for consideration. A judgment, as is well-known, must be read in its entirety and the observations made therein should receive consideration in the light of the questions raised before it. [See [?CITATION?] Although, decisions are galore on this point, we may refer to a recent [?CITATION?] wherein this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 392: \"It is trite that any observation made during the course of reasoning in a judgment should not be read divorced from the context in which they were used.\" It is further well-settled that a decision is not an authority for the proposition which did not fall for its consideration.\n",
      "Paragraph 393: It is also a trite law that a point not raised before a Court would not be an authority on the said question.\n",
      "Paragraph 394: In [?CITATION?], it is stated as follows :- \"11. This question was considered by the Court of Appeal in [?CITATION?], and it was laid down that when no consideration was given to the question, the decision cannot be said to be binding and precedents sub silentio and without arguments are of no moment.\n",
      "Paragraph 395: [?CITATION?], and [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 396: We have noticed, hereinbefore, that in Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra) the only question which arose for consideration was as to whether the decision of the Constitution Bench in Sabhajit Tewary (supra) was correctly rendered by a Constitution Bench of 5-Judges. As the said decision centered around the activities of CSIR vis-`-vis the tests laid down therefor in Sabhajit Tewary (supra), the ratio must be understood to have been laid down in respect of the questions raised therein. The questions raised herein were neither canvassed nor was there any necessity therefor. Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra), therefore, cannot be treated to be a binding precedent within the meaning of Article 141 of the Constitution of India having been rendered in a completely different situation.\n",
      "Paragraph 397: The question has been considered by us on the touchstone of new tests and from a new angle.\n",
      "Paragraph 398: ALLAYING THE APPREHENSION:\n",
      "Paragraph 399: Only because a body answers the description of a public authority, discharges public law functions and have public duties, the same by itself would not lead to the conclusion that all its functions are public functions.\n",
      "Paragraph 400: They are not. (See Donoghue (supra)) Many duties in public law would not be public duties as, for example, duty to pay taxes.\n",
      "Paragraph 401: By way of illustration, we may point out that whereas mandamus can issue directing a private body discharging public utility services in terms of a statute for supply of water and electricity energy, its other functions like flowing from a contract etc. would not generally be amenable to judicial review. (See Constitutional and Administrative Law By A.W. Bradley and K.D. Ewing  Page 303) There are numerous decisions of this Court where such a distinction between public law function and private law function has been drawn by this [?CITATION?], Kerala State Electricity Board Raghunath Gajanan Waingankar, [?CITATION?] In Johri Mal (supra) it is stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 402: \"The legal right of an individual may be founded upon a contract or a statute or an instrument having the force of law. For a public law remedy enforceable under Article 226 of the Constitution, the actions of the authority need to fall in the realm of public law be it a legislative act or the State, an executive act of the State or an instrumentality or a person or authority imbued with public law element. The question is required to be determined in each case having regard to the nature of and extent of authority vested in the State. However, it may not be possible to generalize the nature of the action which would come either under public law remedy or private law field nor is it desirable to give exhaustive list of such actions.\n",
      "Paragraph 403: (Emphasis supplied) The submission of the learned counsel for the Board that once it is declared to be a 'State'; the consequences would be devastating inasmuch as all its activities would be subject to government control, with respect, cannot be accepted as in absence of any statute or statutory rules no such control can ordinarily be exercised by Union of India or State.\n",
      "Paragraph 404: It is not necessary for us to consider as to whether for entering into a contract with the players or for their induction in a team, the provisions of Articles 14 and 16 are required to be complied with as no occasion threrefor has yet arisen. It is, however, necessary to mention that a question as to whether a function of the Board would be a public function or a private function would depend upon the nature and character thereof. This Court cannot be asked to give a hypothetical answer to a hypothetical question.\n",
      "Paragraph 405: The contention of Mr. Venugopal to the effect that the consequences of treating the Board as State will be disastrous inasmuch as all the national sports federations as well as those bodies which represent India in the international fora in the field of art, culture, beauty competitions, cultural events, music and dance, science and other conferences or competitions relating to any subject would become a 'State' is one of the desperation.\n",
      "Paragraph 406: We clarify that this judgment is rendered on the facts of this case. It does not lay down a law that all national sports federations would be State.\n",
      "Paragraph 407: Amongst other federations, one of the important factors which has been taken note of in rendering the decision is the fact that the game of cricket has a special place in India. No other game attracts so much attention or favour.\n",
      "Paragraph 408: Further, no other sport, in India, affords an opportunity to make a livelihood out of it. Of course, each case may have to be considered on its own merit not only having regard to its public functions but also the memorandum of association and the rules and regulations framed by it.\n",
      "Paragraph 409: Only because it is a State within the meaning of Article 12, the same by itself would not mean that it is bound by rule of reservation as contained in Clause 4 of Article 15 and Clause 4 of the Article 16 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 410: SCC 209], it has been held that Article 16(4) is an enabling provision and, thus, it is not mandatory. The State in its discretion may provide reservation or may not . [See also [?CITATION?]] Furthermore, only because a corporation or a society is a State, the same would not necessarily mean that all of its actions should be subject to judicial review. The court's jurisdiction in such matter is limited. [See Johrimal (supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 411: It is furthermore well-settled that issuance of a writ is discretionary in nature. The Court may in a given case and in larger interest may not issue any writ at all.\n",
      "Paragraph 412: Mr. Venugopal vehemently argued that if the Board is held to be a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, the doors of this Court and the High Courts would be knocked at very frequently questioning all and single action of the Board which may include selection of players for Indian Team, day to day functioning et al. We do not agree.\n",
      "Paragraph 413: Recently in Virendra Kumar Srivastava (supra), this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 414: \"Before parting with the case, it is necessary for us to clarify that even though a body, entity or Corporation is held to be a 'State' within the definition of Article 12 of the Constitution what relief to the aggrieved person or employee of such a body or entity is to be granted is a subject matter in each case for the court to determine on the basis of the structure of that society and also its financial capability and viability. The subject of denial or grant of relief partially or fully has to be decided in each particular case by the court dealing with the grievances brought by an aggrieved person against the bodies covered by the definition of 'State' under Article 12 of the Constitution.\" The \"in terrorem\" submission of Mr. Venugopal that a floodgate of litigation would open up if the Board is held to be a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution cannot also be accepted. Floodgate arguments about the claimed devastating effect of being declared a State must be taken with a grain of salt. The courts, firstly, while determining a constitutional question considers such a question to be more or less irrelevant. [See Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee and Another as would be noticed hereinafter that this Court has evolved principles of judicial restraint as regards interfering with the activities of a body in policy matters. It would further appear from the discussions made hereinbefore that as all actions of the Board would not be subject to judicial review. A writ would not lie where the lis involves only private law character.\n",
      "Paragraph 415: We are not oblivious of the fact that one of the grounds why the English Courts refused to broaden the judicial review concept so far as the sporting associations are concerned, that the same would open floodgate.\n",
      "Paragraph 416: (See P.P. Craig's Administrative Law) Unlike England, India has a written Constitution, and, thus, this Court cannot refuse to answer a question only because there may be some repercussions thereto. As indicated hereinbefore, even the decisions of this Court would take care of such apprehension.\n",
      "Paragraph 417: It is interesting to note that Lord Denning M.R. in [?CITATION?] held :- \"It has been suggested by the Chief Education Officer that, if an injunction is granted, chaos will supervene. All the arrangements have been made for the next term, the teachers appointed to the new comprehensive schools, the pupils allotted their places, and so forth. It would be next to impossible, he says, to reverse all these arrangements without complete chaos and damage to teachers, pupils and public. I must say this: if a local authority does not fulfil the requirements of the law, this court will see that it does fulfil them. It will not listen readily to suggestions of \"chaos\". The department of education and the council are subject to the rule of law and must comply with it just like everyone else. Even if chaos should result still the law must be obeyed but I do not think that chaos will result. The evidence convinces me that the \"chaos\" is much over- stated..I see no reason why the position should not be restored, so that the eight school retain their previous character until the statutory requirements are fulfilled. I can well see that there may be a considerable upset for a number of people, but I think it far more important to uphold the rule of law. Parliament has laid down these requirements so as to ensure that the electors can make their objections and have them properly considered. We must see that their rights are upheld.\" CONCLUSION :\n",
      "Paragraph 418: For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the considered view that the writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is maintainable. It is ordered accordingly.\n",

      "Paragraph 2: No.10111/2000 and connected cases. As these appeals involve questions which are analogous, they are heard and disposed of by this common judgment. As the ranks of the parties vary, they will be referred to by their abbreviated names.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Facts in CA Nos. 8599 and 8600 of 2003 :\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 2\\. The Malankara Syrian Catholic College Association of Archidiocese at Trivandrum is a Society registered under the Kerala Literacy, Scientific and Charitable Socieities Registration Act, 1955. It is a minority organisaion and an Educational Agency (for short 'the Society'). It has established and runs several private colleges in Kerala. The colleges are managed by a 'Managing Council' (for short 'the management') appointed by the Educational Agency. The Society has appointed a Manager for the colleges under its management, who implements the decisions of the management. Mar Ivanios College ('college' for short) is one of the colleges run by the said Educational Agency. The said college is an aided private minority institution affiliated to Kerala University under the Kerala University Act, 1974 ('Act\" for short). Educational instruction is provided in the college, in accordance with the provisions of the statutes, Ordinances and Regulations made under the Act. Each of the colleges run by the Society is headed by a Principal, who is responsible for the functional efficiency, quality of education and discipline.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 3\\. The post of Principal of the college fell vacant on 31.3.2000. The Manager issued an order dated 27.3.2000 giving charge of the post of Principal and Drawing & Disbursing Officer ('DDO' for short) to Rev. Daniel Kuzhithaakthil, a lecturer in the college. The said order was approved by the Vice-Chancellor of the University by order dated 15.4.2000.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: The order dated 27.03.2000 was challenged by one of the Lecturers - Dr. Varghese M. Mathunny in O.P. No.10111/2000, wherein an interim order was passed restraining Rev. Daniel from taking charge as Principal. Another Senior Lecturer of the college, Dr. P.V. Thomas also challenged the order dated 27.03.2000 by filing O.P. No. 14337/2000. An interim order was issued in that case on 24.5.2000, restraining Rev. Daniel from functioning as the Principal or DDO.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 4\\. In view of the interim stay preventing Rev. Daniel from acting as the Principal and DDO, the Management made an interim arrangement by appointing T. Jose, a senior lecturer in the College, to discharge the duties of Principal, pending regular appointment to the post. On 5.6.2000, the High Court modified the interim order and gave liberty to the Management to make appointment to the post of Principal on regular basis.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: In pursuance of it, on 6.6.2000, the Management appointed Rev. Daniel as the Principal on regular basis.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 5\\. The appointment of Rev. Daniel as Principal on 6.6.2000 on regular basis was challenged by T.Jose, (claiming to be the senior most among the eligible and fit lecturers) in Appeal No.5/2000 before the Kerala University Appellate Tribunal, raising two contentions : (i) that Rev. Daniel was ineligible to be appointed as Principal as he did not process the requisite qualifications for the post; and (ii) that the appointment was violative of Section 57(3) of the Act, which required the post of Principal, when filled by promotion, to be made on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness. The Tribunal, by an order dated 20.12.2000, held that Rev. Daniel fulfilled the eligibility criteria, but allowed the appeal holding that the appointment of Rev. Daniel as Principal violated Section 57(3) of the Act. The Tribunal directed the Manager to make a fresh appointment in accordance with law. The said order of the Tribunal was challenged by Rev. Daniel and the Society in O.P.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: No.3015/2001 and O.P. No. 3742/2001 contending that Section 57(3) of the Act was invalid and inapplicable in respect of minority institutions, as it interfered with the right of a minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and thereby violated Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India. T. Jose , the appellant before the Tribunal, also challenged the order of the Tribunal in O.P.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: No.10721/2001, as he was aggrieved by the finding of the Tribunal that Rev. Daniel possessed the qualifications for appointment to the post of Principal.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 6\\. The said five writ petitions were heard together and disposed of by a common judgment dated 5.6.2003. The High Court rejected the contention of the Educational Agency and Rev. Daniel that section 57(3) of the Act was violative of Article 30(1). The High Court held that the said Section applied to minority institutions also having regard to that Section, the seniormost from among the eligible and fit lecturers had to be appointed as the Principal. It held that Rev. Daniel was not the senior-most among the eligible and fit lecturers of the college and therefore his appointment could not be sustained.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: Consequently, the High Court rejected O.P. Nos.3015/2001 and 3742/2001 filed by Rev. Daniel and the Society O.P.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: No.10111/2000 filed by Dr. Varghese M. Mathunny was dismissed as having become infructuous as he had retired on 31.5.2001 and as he had not challenged the order dated 6.6.2000 appointing Rev. Daniel as Principal. O.P.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: No.10721/2001 filed by T.Jose was allowed. Even though T.Jose had also retired in the meanwhile on 31.3.2001, the High Court directed that his claim for promotion as Principal shall be considered with effect from the date (6.6.2000) when Rev.\n",

      "Paragraph 18: 7\\. Feeling aggrieved by the said Judgment dated 5.6.2003, the Society and Rev. Daniel have filed C.A. No.8599/2003 and C.A.No.8600/2003 respectively challenging the dismissal of their writ petitions OP No.3742/2001 and OP No.3015/2001.\n",

      "Paragraph 20: 8\\. St. Gregorious College, another aided minority educational institution, appointed P.G. Thomas Pannicker as Principal by order dated 25.9.2002. The said appointment was challenged by Thomas Lukose before the Kerala University Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No. 15/2002. The Tribunal allowed the said appeal by order dated 30.1.2003 and set aside the appointment of P.G. Thomas Pannicker as Principal and directed fresh selection. That was challenged by the Manager of St. Gregorious College and P.L. Thomas Pannicker, in O.P.\n",

      "Paragraph 23: Gregorious College and Thomas Pannicker in CA No.8576/2003.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: The Issue\n",
      "Paragraph 25: 9\\. The High Court relying on the decision of the Eleven- Judge Bench of this Court in [?CITATION?] has held that receipt of aid by a minority institution removes the protection under Article 30(1), by taking away its right to claim immunity from interference and therefore all regulations made by the State, governing the manner of making appointments and removal, as also the conditions of service of Principals and Lecturers, will be binding on such aided institution. The High Court held that aid carries the 'price' of surrender of a part of its freedom and independence in matters of administration. As a consequence, it held that Section 57(3) of the Act providing that appointments of Principal should be on the basis of seniority- cum-fitness, is valid and binding on minority institutions.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 10\\. The appellants contend that the right to appoint Principal and teachers is the most important facet of minority's \"right to administer\" under Article 30(1) of the Constitution. They submit that receipt of aid by minority institutions, does not, in any way, fetter or abridge their constitutional right to administer educational institutions, and therefore Section 57(3) of the Act requiring the appointment of only the senior-most of lecturers as Principal is violative of Article 30(1) of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 11\\. On the other hand, the respondents contend that minorities do not have an unfettered right under Article 30(1) to administer and manage its education institutions; that the State and its agencies can regulate certain facets of administration of private educational institutions by minorities, in particular by prescribing the minimum qualification, experience and other conditions bearing on merit for being appointed as a teacher or Principal; that if such institution is aided by the State, the State can make regulations governing the service conditions for teaching and other staff, which includes the post of Principal;\n",
      "Paragraph 28: and that Section 57(3) of the Act providing for the manner of filling the post of Principal by promotion, is therefore binding upon minority institutions receiving aid from the State.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 12\\. The rival contentions give rise to the following questions:\n",
      "Paragraph 30: (i) To what extent, the State can regulate the right of the minorities to administer their educational institutions, when such institutions receive aid from the State.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: (ii) Whether the right to choose a Principal is part of the right of minorities under Article 30(1) to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. If so, Section 57(3) of the Act would violate Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: Re : Question (i)\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 13\\. Article 30(1) gives minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. In [?CITATION?], a Constitution Bench of this Court explained 'right to administer' thus :\n",
      "Paragraph 34: \"Administration means 'management of the affairs' of the institution. This management must be free of control so that the founders or their nominees can mould the institution as they think fit, and in accordance with their ideas of how the interests of the community in general and the institution in particular will be best served. No part of this management can be taken away and vested in another body without an encroachment upon the guaranteed right.\" \"There is, however, an exception to this and it is that the standards of education are not a part of management as such. These standards concern the body politic and are dictated by considerations of the advancement of the country and its people. Therefore, if universities establish the syllabi for examinations they must be followed, subject however to special subjects which the institutions may seek to reach, and to a certain extent the State may also regulate the conditions of employment of teachers and the health and hygiene of students. Such regulations do not bear directly upon management as such although they may indirectly affect it. Yet the right of the State to regulate education, educational standards and allied matters cannot be denied. The minority institutions cannot be allowed to fall below the standards of excellence expected of educational institutions, or under the guise of exclusive right of management, to decline to follow the general pattern. While the management must be left to them, they may be compelled to keep in step with others.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 14\\. In [?CITATION?], a nine Judge Bench of this Court considered the scope and ambit of minority's right to administer educational institutions established by them. The majority were of the view that prescription of conditions of service would attract better and competent teachers and would not jeopardize the right of the management of minority institutions to appoint teachers of their choice. It was also observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 36: \"Autonomy in administration means right to administer effectively and to manage and conduct the affairs of the institutions. The distinction is between a restriction on the right of administration and a regulation prescribing the manner of administration. The right of administration is day to day administration. The choice in the personnel of management is a part of the administration. The university will always have a right to see that there is no mal- administration. If there is mal-administration, the university will take steps to cure the same. There may be control and check on administration in order to find out whether the minority institutions are engaged in activities which are not conducive to the interest of the minority or to the requirements of the teachers and the students.\" \"The ultimate goal of a minority institution too imparting general secular education is advancement of learning. This Court has consistently held that it is not only permissible but also desirable to regulate everything in educational and academic matters for achieving excellence and uniformity in standards of education.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: In the field of administration it is not reasonable to claim that minority institutions will have complete autonomy.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Checks on the administration may be necessary in order to ensure that the administration is efficient and sound and will serve the academic needs of the institution. The right of a minority to administer its educational institution involves, as part of it, a correlative duty of good administration.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 15\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 40: \"The excellence of the instruction provided by an institution would depend directly on the excellence of the teaching staff, and in turn, that would depend on the quality and the contentment of the teachers. Conditions of service pertaining to minimum qualifications of teachers, their salaries, allowances and other conditions of service which ensure security, contentment and decent living standards to teachers and which will consequently enable them to render better service to the institution and the pupils cannot surely be said to be violative of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 30(1) of the Constitution. The management of a minority Educational Institution cannot be permitted under the guise of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 30(1) of the Constitution, to oppress or exploit its employees any more than any other private employee.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: Oppression or exploitation of the teaching staff of an educational institution is bound to lead, inevitably, to discontent and deterioration of the standard of instruction imparted in the institution affecting adversely the object of making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: The management of minority institution cannot complain of invasion of the fundamental right to administer the institution when it denies the members of its staff the opportunity to achieve the very object of Article 30(1) which is to make the institution an effective vehicle of education.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 16\\. The scope of Article 30(1), with reference to the scope of the right to administer educational institutions, was also considered by this court in In [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 17\\. In TMA Pai (supra), this Court made it clear that a minority institution does not cease to be so, merely on receipt of aid from the State or its agencies. In other words, receipt of aid does not alter the nature or character of the minority educational institution receiving aid. Article 30(1) clearly implies that any grant that is given by the State to the minority institution cannot have such conditions attached to it which will in any way dilute or abridge the rights of the minorities to establish and administer educational institutions. But all conditions that have relevance to the proper utilization of the aid by an educational institution can be imposed. The High Court, however, wrongly construed TMA Pai and concluded that acceptance of aid by a minority institution takes away its right to claim immunity from interference and therefore the State can lay down any regulation governing the conditions of service of employees of aided minority institutions ignoring the constitutional guarantee under Article 30(1). For this purpose, the High Court relied on the observations in Paras 72 and 73 of TMA Pai (supra). The said paragraphs are extracted below :\n",
      "Paragraph 45: \"72. Once aid is granted to a private professional educational institution, the Government or the State agency, as a condition of the grant of aid, can put fetters on the freedom in the matter of administration and management of the institution. The State, which gives aid to an educational institution, can impose such conditions as are necessary for the proper maintenance of the high standards of education as the financial burden is shared by the State. The State would also be under an obligation to protect the interest of the teaching and non-teaching staff.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: In many States, there are various statutory provisions to regulate the functioning of such educational institutions where the States give, as a grant or aid, a substantial proportion of the revenue expenditure including salary, pay and allowances of teaching and non-teaching staff. It would be its responsibility to ensure that the teachers working in those institutions are governed by proper service conditions. The State, in the case of such aided institutions, has ample power to regulate the method of selection and appointment of teachers after prescribing requisite qualifications for the same. Ever since In [?CITATION?] this Court has upheld, in the case of aided institutions, those regulations that served the interests of students and teachers. Checks on the administration may be necessary in order to ensure that the administration is efficient and sound and will serve the academic needs of the institutions. In other words, rules and regulations that promote good administration and prevent maladministration can be formulated so as to promote the efficiency of teachers, discipline and fairness in administration and to preserve harmony among affiliated institutions.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 47: 73\\. There are a large number of educational institutions, like schools and non-professional colleges, which cannot operate without the support of aid from the State, Although these institutions may have been established by philanthropists or other public-spirited persons, it becomes necessary, in order to provide inexpensive education to the students, to seek aid from the State. In such cases, as those of the professional aided institutions referred to hereinabove, the Government would be entitled to make regulations relating to the terms and conditions of employment of the teaching and non-teaching staff whenever the aid for the posts is given by the State as well as admission procedures. Such rules and regulations can also provide for the reasons and the manner in which a teacher or any other member of the staff can be removed. In other words, the autonomy of a private aided institution would be less than that of an unaided institution.\" But the aforesaid observations in Paras 72 and 73 were not made with reference to aided minority educational institutions.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: The observations in para 72 were intended for aided non- minority private professional institutions. The observation in para 73 in the context of aided non-minority non-professional private institutions. The position of minority educational institutions securing aid from the State or its agencies was considered in Para 80 to 155, wherein it was clearly held that receipt of State-aid does not annihilate the right guaranteed to minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice under Article 30(1).\n",
      "Paragraph 49: 18\\. The observations of the Eleven-Judge Bench in TMA Pai (supra) in respect of the extent to which the right of administration of aided minority educational institutions could be regulated, are extracted below :\n",
      "Paragraph 50: \" the state cannot, when it chooses to grant aid to educational institutions, deny aid to a religious or linguistic minority institution only on the ground that the management of that institution is with the minority. We would, however, like to clarify that if an abject surrender of the right to management is made a condition of aid, the denial of aid would be violative of Article 30(2). However, conditions of aid that do not involve a surrender of the substantial right of management would not be inconsistent with constitutional guarantees, even if they indirectly impinge upon some facet of administration.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: It cannot be argued that no conditions can be imposed while giving aid to a minority institution. Whether it is an institution run by the majority or the minority, all conditions that have relevance to the proper utilization of the grant-in-aid by an educational institution can be imposed. . The conditions for grant or non-grant of aid to educational institutions have to be uniformly applied, whether it is a majority-run institution or a minority-run institution. As in the case of a majority run institution, the moment a minority institution obtains a grant of aid, Article 28 of the Constitution comes into play. When an educational institution is maintained out of State funds, no religious instruction can be provided therein.\" (Emphasis supplied) Among the questions formulated and answered by the majority while summarising conclusions, Question 5(c) and answer thereto has a bearing on the issue on hand : Question 5 ( c ) is extracted below :\n",
      "Paragraph 52: \"Whether the statutory provisions which regulate the facets of administration like control over educational agencies, control over governing bodies, conditions of affiliation including recognition/withdrawal thereof, and appointment of staff, employees, teachers and principals including their service conditions and regulation of fees, etc. would interfere with the right of administration of minorities ? The first part of the answer to Question 5 ( c ) related to unaided minority institutions. With reference to statutory provisions regulating the facets of administration, this court expressed the view that in case of an unaided minority educational institutions, the regulatory measure of control should be minimal; and in the matter of day-to- day management, like the appointment of staff (both teaching and non-teaching) and administrative control over them, the management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency. But such institutions should have to comply with the conditions of recognition and conditions of affiliation to a University or Board; and a rational procedure for the selection of teaching staff and for taking disciplinary action has to be evolved by the management itself.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: This Court also held that fees to be charged by unaided institutions cannot be regulated but no institution should charge capitation fee.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: The second part of the answer to Question 5( c ) applicable to aided minority institutions, is extracted below :- \"For redressing the grievances of employees of aided and unaided institutions who are subjected to punishment or termination from service, a mechanism will have to be evolved, and in our opinion, appropriate tribunals could be constituted, and till then, such tribunals could be presided over by a judicial officer of the rank of District Judge.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: The State or other controlling authorities, however, can always prescribe the minimum qualification, experience and other conditions bearing on the merit of an individual for being appointed as a teacher or a principal of any educational institution.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: Regulations can be framed governing service conditions for teaching and other staff for whom aid is provided by the State, without interfering with the overall administrative control of the management over the staff.\" (Emphasis supplied) The position enunciated in TMA Pai is reiterated in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 57: 19\\. The general principles relating to establishment and administration of educational institution by minorities may be summarized thus:\n",
      "Paragraph 58: (i) The right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice comprises the following rights :\n",
      "Paragraph 59: a) To choose its governing body in whom the founders of the institution have faith and confidence to conduct and manage the affairs of the institution;\n",
      "Paragraph 60: b) To appoint teaching staff (Teachers/Lecturers and Head-masters/Principals) as also non-teaching staff;\n",
      "Paragraph 61: and to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of its employees;\n",
      "Paragraph 62: c) To admit eligible students of their choice and to set up a reasonable fee structure;\n",
      "Paragraph 63: d) To use its properties and assets for the benefit of the institution;\n",
      "Paragraph 64: (ii) The right conferred on minorities under Article 30 is only to ensure equality with the majority and not intended to place the minorities in a more advantageous position vis- `-vis the majority. There is no reverse discrimination in favour of minorities. The general laws of the land relating to national interest, national security, social welfare, public order, morality, health, sanitation, taxation etc. applicable to all, will equally apply to minority institutions also.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: (iii) The right to establish and administer educational institutions is not absolute. Nor does it include the right to maladminister. There can be regulatory measures for ensuring educational character and standards and maintaining academic excellence. There can be checks on administration as are necessary to ensure that the administration is efficient and sound, so as to serve the academic needs of the institution. Regulations made by the State concerning generally the welfare of students and teachers, regulations laying down eligibility criteria and qualifications for appointment, as also conditions of service of employees (both teaching and non-teaching), regulations to prevent exploitation or oppression of employees, and regulations prescribing syllabus and curriculum of study fall under this category. Such regulations do not in any manner interfere with the right under Article 30(1).\n",
      "Paragraph 66: (iv) Subject to the eligibility conditions/qualifications prescribed by the State being met, the unaided minority educational institutions will have the freedom to appoint teachers/Lecturers by adopting any rational procedure of selection.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: (v) Extention of aid by the State, does not alter the nature and character of the minority educational institution.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: Conditions can be imposed by the State to ensure proper utilization of the aid, without however diluting or abridging the right under Article 30(1).\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 20\\. Aided institutions give instruction either in secular education or professional education. Religious education is barred in educational institutions maintained out of State fund.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: These aided educational minority institutions providing secular education or professional education should necessarily have standards comparable with non- minority educational institutions. Such standards can be attained and maintained only by having well qualified professional teachers. An institution can have the services of good qualified professional teachers only if the condition of service ensures security, contentment and decent living standards. That is why State can regulate the service conditions of the employees of the minority educational institutions to ensure quality of education. Consequently, any law intended to regulate the service conditions of employees of educational institutions will apply to minority institutions also, provided that such law does not interfere with the overall administrative control of the managements over the staff.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 21\\. We may also recapitulate the extent of regulation by the State, permissible in respect of employees of minority educational institutions receiving aid from the State, as clarified and crystalised in TMA Pai. The State can prescribe :\n",
      "Paragraph 72: (i) the minimum qualifications, experience and other criteria bearing on merit, for making appointments, (ii) the service conditions of employees without interfering with the overall administrative control by the Management over the staff.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: (iii) a mechanism for redressal of the grievances of the employees.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: (iv) the conditions for the proper utilisation of the aid by the educational institutions, without abridging or diluting the right to establish and administer educational institutions.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: In other words, all laws made by the State to regulate the administration of educational institutions, and grant of aid, will apply to minority educational institutions also. But if any such regulations interfere with the overall administrative control by the Management over the staff, or abridges/dilutes, in any other manner, the right to establish and administer educational institutions, such regulations, to that extent, will be inapplicable to minority institutions.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: Re: Question (ii) :\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 22\\. The Principal or Headmaster of an educational institution is responsible for the functional efficiency of the institution, as also the quality of education and discipline in the institution. He is also responsible for maintaining the philosophy and objects of the institution.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: 23\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court upheld the decisions of the Kerala High Court declaring sub-sections (1) (2) (3) of section 53 of the Kerala University Act, 1969 relating to appointment of Principals were ultra vires Article 30(1) in respect of minority institutions. This Court affirmed the following findings of the High Court (reported in 1969 Kerala Law Times 749) without independently considering the same :- \"The principal of a college is, as S.2(12) recognizes, the head of the college, and, the post of the principal is of pivotal importance in the life of a college; around him wheels the tone and temper of the institution; on him depends the continuity of its traditions, the maintenance of discipline and the efficiency of its teaching; and the right to choose the principal is perhaps the most important facet of the right to administer a college. The imposition of any trammel thereon  except to the extent of prescribing the requisite qualifications and experience or otherwise fostering the interests of the institution itself  cannot but be considered as a violation of the right guaranteed by article 30(1) of the Constitution, and, for the reasons we have already given, by article 19(1)(f) as well. To hold otherwise would be to make the rights \"a teasing illusion, a promise of unreality\". Provision may, of course, be made to ensure that only proper persons are appointed to the post of principal; the qualifications necessary may be prescribed, and the mode of selection for the purpose of securing the best men may be laid down. But to go beyond that and place any further fetter on the choice would be an unreasonable interference with the right of management.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: Therefore, so far as the post of principal is concerned, we think it should be left to the management to secure the services of the best person available. This, it seems to us, is of paramount importance, and the prospects of advancement of the staff must yield to it. The management must have as wide a field of choice as possible; yet sub- section (2) of Section 53 restricts the choice to the teachers of the colleges or of all the colleges, as the case may be, and enables the appointment of an outsider only if there is no suitable person in such college or colleges. That might well have the result of condemning the post to a level of dull mediocrity. A provision by which an outsider is to be appointed, or a junior member of the staff preferred to a senior member, only if he is of superior merit, the assessment of which must largely be left to the management, is understandable; but a provision which compels the management to appoint only a teacher of the college (or colleges) unless it pronounces all the teachers unsuitable, is clearly in derogation of the powers of the management, and not calculated to further the interest of the institution.. But we might say that there can be no objection to the appointment of the principal as of any other member of the staff being subject to the approval of some authority of the University so long as disapproval can be only on the ground that the person appointed has not the requisite qualifications. Also that if disapproval is not to be only on some such stated ground, but is left entirely to the will and pleasure of the appointing authority, that would be to deprive the educational agency of its power of appointment and would be bad for offending article 19(1)(f) and article 30(1).\" (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 24\\. The importance of the right to appointment of Principals/Head-masters and teachers of their choice by minorities, as an important part of their fundamental rights under Article 30 was highlighted in St. Xavier (supra) thus :\n",
      "Paragraph 81: \"It is upon the principal and teachers of a college that the tone and temper of an educational institution depend. On them would depend its reputation, the maintenance of discipline and its efficiency in teaching. The right to choose the principal and to have the teaching conducted by teachers appointed by the management after an overall assessment of their outlook and philosophy is perhaps the most important facet of the right to administer an educational institution. So long as the persons chosen have the qualifications prescribed by the University, the choice must be left to the management. That is part of the fundamental right of the minorities to administer the educational institution established by them.\" [Emphasis supplied]\n",
      "Paragraph 82: 25\\. In N.Ammad (supra) the appellant contended that he being the senior-most graduate teacher of an aided minority school, he should be appointed as the Headmaster and none else. He relied on Rule 44A of the Kerala Education Rules which provided that appointment of Headmaster shall ordinarily be according to seniority, from the seniority list prepared and maintained under clauses (a) and (b) of Rule 34. This Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 83: \"Selection and appointment of Headmaster in a school (or Principal of a college) are of prime importance in administration of that educational institution. The Headmaster is the key post in the running of the school. He is the hub on which all the spokes of the school are set around whom they rotate to generate result. A school is personified through its Headmaster and he is the focal point on which outsiders look at the school. A bad Headmaster can spoil the entire institution, an efficient and honest Headmaster can improve it by leaps and bounds. The functional efficacy of a school very much depends upon the efficiency and dedication of its Headmaster. This pristine precept remains unchanged despite many changes taking place in the structural patterns of education over the years.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: How important is the post of Headmaster of a school has been pithily stated by a Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in [?CITATION?] Chief Justice M.S. Menon has, in a style which is inimitable, stated thus :\n",
      "Paragraph 85: \"The post of the headmaster is of pivotal importance in the life of a school. Around him wheels the tone and temper of the institution; on him depends the continuity of its traditions, the maintenance of discipline and the efficiency of its teaching. The right to choose the headmaster is perhaps the most important facet of the right to administer a school, and we must hold that the imposition of any trammel thereon  except to the extent of prescribing the requisite qualifications and experience  cannot but be considered as a violation of the right guaranteed by Article 30(1) of the Constitution. To hold otherwise will be to make the right 'a teasing illusion, a promise of unreality'.\" Thereafter, this Court concluded that the management of minority institution is free to find out a qualified person either from the staff of the same institution or from outside, to fill up the vacancy; and that the management's right to choose a qualified person as the Headmaster of the school is well insulated by the protective cover of Article 30(1) of the Constitution and it cannot be chiselled out through any legislative act or executive rule except for fixing up the qualifications and conditions of service for the post; and that any such statutory or executive feat would be violative of the fundamental right enshrined in Article 30(1) and would therefore be void. This Court further observed that if the management of the school is not given the wide freedom to choose the person for holding the key- post of Principal subject, of course, to the restriction regarding qualifications to be prescribed by the State, the right to administer the School would get much diminished.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: 26\\. In Board of Secondary Education and Teachers Training (supra), this Court held :\n",
      "Paragraph 87: \"The decisions of this Court make it clear that in the matter of appointment of the Principal, the management of a minority educational institution has a choice. It has been held that one of the incidents of the right to administer a minority educational institution is the selection of the Principal. Any rules which takes away this right of the management have been held to be interfering with the right guaranteed by Article 30 of the Constitution. In this case, both Julius Prasad selected by the management and the third respondent are qualified and eligible for appointment as Principal according to rules. The question is whether the management is not entitled to select a person of their choice. The decisions of this court including the decision in [?CITATION?] and Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v. State of Gujarat make it clear that this right of the minority educational institution cannot be taken away by any rules or regulations or by any enactment made by the State. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the High Court was not right in holding otherwise. The State has undoubtedly the power to regulate the affairs of the minority educational institutions also in the interest of discipline and excellence. But in that process, the aforesaid right of the management cannot be taken away, even if the Government is giving hundred per cent grant.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 88: 27\\. It is thus clear that the freedom to choose the person to be appointed as Principal has always been recognized as a vital facet of the right to administer the educational institution. This has not been, in any way, diluted or altered by TMA Pai.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: Having regard to the key role played by the Principal in the management and administration of the educational institution, there can be no doubt that the right to choose the Principal is an important part of the right of administration and even if the institution is aided, there can be no interference with the said right. The fact that the post of the Principal/Headmaster is also covered by State aid, will make no difference.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: 28\\. The appellant contends that the protection extended by Article 30(1) cannot be used against a member of the teaching staff who belongs to the same minority community. It is contended that a minority institution cannot ignore the rights of eligible lecturers belonging to the same community, senior to the person proposed to be selected, merely because the institution has the right to select a Principal of its choice. But this contention ignores the position that the right of the minority to select a Principal of its choice is with reference to the assessment of the person's outlook and philosophy and ability to implement its objects. The management is entitled to appoint the person, who according to them is most suited, to head the institution, provided he possesses the qualifications prescribed for the posts. The career advancement prospects of the teaching staff, even those belonging to the same community, should have to yield to the right of the management under Article 30(1) to establish and administer educational institutions.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: 29\\. Section 57(3) of the Act provides that the post of Principal when filled by promotion is to be made on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness. Section 57(3) trammels the right of the management to take note of merit of the candidate, or the outlook and philosophy of the candidate which will determine whether he is supportive of the objects of the institution. Such a provision clearly interferes with the right of the minority management to have a person of their choice as head of the institution and thus violates Article 30(1). Section 57(3) of the Act cannot therefore apply to minority run educational institutions even if they are aided.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: 30\\. In view of the above, we allow these appeals and, consequently, set aside the judgment dated 5.6.2003 of the High Court. As a consequence, O.P.Nos.10111/2000, 10721/2001 and 14337/2000 stand dismissed. O.P.No.3015, 3742 and 6621/2003 filed by the College Managements/Selected Principals are allowed.\n",

      "Paragraph 2: 1\\. Whether Section 5 of the [Limitation Act, 1963] (for short, `the [Limitation Act]') can be invoked by this Court for allowing the aggrieved person to file an appeal under Section 125 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (for short, `the Electricity Act') after more than 120 days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (for short, `the Tribunal') is the question which requires 2 determination in this appeal filed against order dated 17.5.2007 passed by the Tribunal in I.A. No.4 of 2007 in Appeal No.21 of 2006.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 2\\. Appellant, Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board was established under Section 58 of the M.P. Reorganization Act, 2000. In a sense, it is a successor of Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board insofar as the State of Chhattisgarh is concerned. A dispute arose between the appellant and respondent No.3 - Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board in the matter of payment of FLEE charges to the beneficiaries in the Western Region under the \"Frequency Linked Energy Exchange\" scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1.6.1992. The FLEE charges were payable to the beneficiaries on the basis of monthly advises issued by Western Regional Electricity Board (renamed as Western Regional Board Committee) (respondent No.5 herein). The matter was considered by respondent No.1 - Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, which passed an order dated 8.12.2005 fixing the liability of the appellant and respondent No.3 in the matter of payment of FLEE charges.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 3\\. The appellant challenged the aforementioned order in Appeal No.21/2006, which was allowed by the Tribunal vide its order dated 14.11.2006. Soon thereafter, respondent No.3 filed IA No.4/2007 for issue 3 of a direction to respondent No.5 to recalculate FLEE charges in accordance with the Tribunal's order in relation to post-reorganization period. By order dated 17.5.2007, the Tribunal allowed that application and directed respondent No.5 to recalculate FLEE charges in accordance with order dated 14.11.2006.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 4\\. Feeling aggrieved by the last mentioned order of the Tribunal, the appellant filed this appeal on 24.12.2007. Along with the appeal, the appellant filed an application for condonation of 160 days' delay. The reasons for not filing appeal within the period of 60 days specified in Section 125 of the Electricity Act, as disclosed in the application are as under: - i) The impugned order had been pronounced by the Tribunal on 17.5.2007 but the counsel for the appellant did not receive intimation of the said pronouncement and as such he was not aware of the same.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: ii) That the procedure which was being followed by the Tribunal at that time was that the Registry of the Tribunal used to telephonically give advance intimation to the counsel of the parties regarding pronouncement of the order.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 4 iii) The appellant came to know about the order in July, 2007 when respondent No.5 sent intimation for payment of FLEE charges to the beneficiaries in the Western Region. Thereupon, the appellant informed its counsel about the impugned order who then sent letter dated 26.7.2007 to the Registrar of the Tribunal that intimation regarding pronouncement of the order had not been given to him (the date has been wrongly typed in paragraph 3 of the application as 26.11.2007).\n",
      "Paragraph 8: iv) Respondent No.3 had filed a review petition against order dated 14.11.2006, which was not decided by the Tribunal along with I.A. No.4 of 2007 and the same was withdrawn on 25.10.2007.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: v) Thereafter, the impugned order was considered and discussed by the appellant and after obtaining legal opinion, it was decided to file an appeal.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: vi) In the light of the decision taken by the appellant, the counsel proceeded to prepare the appeal but some delay was caused due to extensive pleadings and voluminous documents.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 5\\. In the reply filed on behalf of respondent No.3, it has been averred that the impugned order was communicated by the Deputy Registrar of the Tribunal vide his letter dated 11.6.2007; that the appellant and the 5 respondents before the Tribunal were informed by the said letter that the matter was disposed of on 14.5.2007 and the parties may request for a copy of the order in PDF format through e-mail at registrar-aptel@nic.in or apply for a certified copy and further that the order would also be available in the Tribunal's website (www.aptel.gov.in). It has been further averred that letter sent by the Deputy Registrar of the Tribunal was received by the appellant on 21.6.2007 which was entered in its receipt register at serial No.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 2082 and subsequently, the same was received by the office of the Chief Engineer (Commercial) on 29.6.2007. Respondent No.3 has supported this assertion by placing on record photostat copies of the inward register maintained in the office of Secretary of the appellant, which were made available pursuant to an application filed under the Right to Information Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: Respondent No.3 has then relied upon the appellant's assertion that it came to know about order dated 17.5.2007 in July, 2007 and prayed that in the absence of any explanation by the appellant for remaining silent from July, 2007 to December, 2007, the appeal cannot be entertained. As regards the review application, respondent No.3 has averred that the same has no bearing on the appellant's grievance against order dated 17.5.2007 and in the absence of any explanation for the delay after 21.6.2007, the appeal should be dismissed as barred by time.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 6\n",
      "Paragraph 15: 6\\. In the rejoinder affidavit filed on behalf of the appellant, it has been pleaded that in the absence of communication of order by the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions contained in Chapter XVI of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (Procedure, Form, Fee and Record of Proceedings) Rules, 2007 (for short, `the Rules'), the appeal cannot be dismissed as barred by time. It has then been averred that letter dated 7.6.2007 of the Tribunal, which was signed by Deputy Registrar on 11.6.2007 cannot be treated as communication of order dated 17.5.2007. It has been further averred that letter dated 7.6.2007 was received in the secretariat of the appellant on 25.6.2007 and the same was forwarded to the concerned department on 28.6.2007. In paragraph 6 of the affidavit, it has been averred that officers of the appellant had no knowledge of the impugned order till the receipt of intimation from respondent No.5 in July 2007 regarding payment to the beneficiaries in the Western Region and, thereafter, steps were taken for filing appeal.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 7\\. Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, learned senior counsel for the appellant argued that even though the appeal was filed after more than 120 days counted from the date of the Tribunal's order and, in terms of proviso to Section 125 of the Electricity Act, this Court can extend the time for filing 7 an appeal up to a maximum of 60 days only, power under Section 5 read with Section 29(2) of the [Limitation Act] can be exercised for condonation of delay beyond the period of 120 days. In support of this argument, Shri Prasad placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in [?CITATION?] Learned senior counsel laid considerable emphasis on the fact that by virtue of the impugned order huge liability has been created against the appellant and if the appeal is not entertained, it will suffer irreparable injury.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: 8\\. Shri C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned senior counsel appearing for respondent No.3 argued that in view of the plain language of the proviso to Section 125 of the Electricity Act, this Court has no power to extend the period for filing an appeal beyond 120 days and the provisions of the [Limitation Act] cannot be invoked for negating the legislative intendment to prescribe special limitation for filing an appeal against any decision or order of the Tribunal. Learned senior counsel further argued that letter dated 7.6.2007 sent by Deputy Registrar of the Tribunal informing the parties that the IA was disposed of on 17.5.2007 and they may request for a copy of the order in PDF format through e-mail or apply for a certified copy amounts to communication of the order within the meaning of Section 125 of the 8 Electricity Act read with Rule 98 of the Rules and the appeal filed after more than 120 days from the date of receipt of letter dated 7.6.2007 is liable to be dismissed as barred by time. Learned senior counsel submitted that even if intimation given by the Deputy Registrar of the Tribunal vide letter dated 7.6.2007 is ignored, the appeal is liable to be dismissed because the appellant had become aware of the Tribunal's order on 17.7.2007 i.e., the day on which letter dated 6.7.2007 sent by respondent No.5 was received in the office of its Secretary. Learned senior counsel submitted that if the period of limitation is counted from 17.7.2007, the appeal could be filed by 15.9.2007 whereas the same was actually filed on 24.12.2007. Learned senior counsel then invited the Court's attention to the memo of appeal and application filed for condonation of delay to show that the same had been prepared on 7.9.2007 but were filed on 24.12.2007 i.e., after more than three and half months. In support of his argument that this Court cannot extend the time beyond 60 days in terms of proviso to Section 125 of the Electricity Act, Shri Vaidyanathan relied upon the judgments of this Court in [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]\n",

      "Paragraph 36: 10\\. The Electricity Act was enacted in the backdrop of dismal performance of various state electricity boards and alarming decline in the availability of power necessary for domestic, agricultural and industrial sectors. Before enactment of the Electricity Act, the electricity supply industry was governed by the [Indian Electricity Act 1910], The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and the [Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998].\n",
      "Paragraph 37: The [Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948] mandated the creation of electricity board for every state. The state electricity boards had the responsibility of arranging the supply of electricity in the state. Over a period of time, the performance of state electricity boards deteriorated on account of various factors including their inability to take decisions on tariffs in a professional and independent manner. In practice, the state governments started determining tariff and huge concessions were provided to various segments of the consumers, many of which were not deserving. Cross-subsidies had reached unsustainable level. To address this issue and to provide for 12 independent determination of tariffs, the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998 was enacted. Under that Act, the Central Government created the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and most of the state governments created the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions either under the Central Act or under their respective state legislations with a view to implement the policy of encouraging private sector participation in generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and to harmonize and rationalize the provisions of the three Acts, the Electricity Act was enacted. Part II thereof contains provisions under which the Central Government is entitled to prepare the National Electricity Policy and tariff policy, in consultation with the state governments and the Central Electricity Authority for development of the power system based on optimal utilisation of resources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear substances or materials, hydro and renewable sources of energy. Under the same part, the Central Government can prepare and notify national policies, permitting stand alone systems for rural areas, for rural electrification and for bulk purchase of power and management of local distribution in rural areas through panchayat institutions, users' associations, co-operative societies, non-governmental organisations or franchisees. Part III contains provision relating to generation of electricity. Part IV regulates grant of licenses for 13 transmission of electricity, distribution of electricity and trading in electricity. Part V deals with transmission of electricity including inter- state transmission. Part VI deals with distribution of electricity. Part VII contains provision relating to tariff. The provisions contained in Part IX provide for establishment of the Central Electricity Regulatory Authority and its functions and duties and those contained in Part X provide for establishment of the Central and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions and their functions. The Electricity Act also envisages establishment of Tribunal to hear appeals against the orders of adjudicating officers or regulatory commissions (Part XI). In terms of Section 111, any person aggrieved by an order made by an adjudicating officer except the one made under Section 127 or an order made by an appropriate Commission under this Act can prefer an appeal to the Tribunal. The composition of the Tribunal and qualifications prescribed for appointment of Chairperson and Member shows that the legislature intended to create a specialized adjudicatory forum for deciding various disputes emanating from the operation of the Act. Section 125 provides for an appeal to this Court against any order or decision of the Tribunal which can be filed within 60 days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Tribunal. The limitation placed on the jurisdiction of this Court is that the appeal can be entertained only on one or 14 more of the grounds specified in Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Proviso to Section 125 empowers this Court to entertain the appeal within a further period not exceeding 60 days, if it is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal within the said period.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: In other words, an appeal under Section 125 can be filed within a maximum period of 120 days if this Court is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing the same within 60 days from the date of communication of the decision or order appealed against. Part XII contains provisions relating to investigation leading to assessment of electricity charges payable by the consumer and enforcement of the orders of assessment. It also contains provisions for appeal against the final order passed under Section 126. Part XIV contains provisions to deal with theft of electricity, electric lines and materials, interference with meters and work of licensees and also provides for fiscal penalties and substantive punishments. Section 145 declares that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which an assessing officer referred to in Section 126 or an appellate authority referred to in Section 127 or the adjudicating officer appointed under the Act is empowered by or under the Act to determine and no injunction shall be granted in such matters.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 15\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 11\\. The brief analysis of the scheme of the Electricity Act shows that it is a self-contained comprehensive legislation, which not only regulates generation, transmission and distribution of electricity by public bodies and encourages public sector participation in the process but also ensures creation of special adjudicatory mechanism to deal with the grievance of any person aggrieved by an order made by an adjudicating officer under the Act except under Section 127 or an order made by the appropriate commission. Section 110 provides for establishment of a Tribunal to hear such appeals. Section 111(1) and (2) lays down that any person aggrieved by an order made by an adjudicating officer or an appropriate commission under this Act may prefer an appeal to the Tribunal within a period of 45 days from the date on which a copy of the order made by an adjudicating officer or the appropriate commission is received by him. Section 111(5) mandates that the Tribunal shall deal with the appeal as expeditiously as possible and endeavour to dispose of the same finally within 180 days from the date of receipt thereof. If the appeal is not disposed of within 180 days, the Tribunal is required to record reasons in writing for not doing so.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: Section 125 lays down that any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Tribunal can file an appeal to this Court within 60 days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Tribunal. Proviso to Section 16 125 empowers this Court to entertain an appeal filed within a further period of 60 days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing appeal within the initial period of 60 days. This shows that the period of limitation prescribed for filing appeals under Sections 111(2) and 125 is substantially different from the period prescribed under the [Limitation Act] for filing suits etc. The use of the expression `within a further period of not exceeding 60 days' in Proviso to Section 125 makes it clear that the outer limit for filing an appeal is 120 days. There is no provision in the Act under which this Court can entertain an appeal filed against the decision or order of the Tribunal after more than 120 days. The object underlying establishment of a special adjudicatory forum i.e., the Tribunal to deal with the grievance of any person who may be aggrieved by an order of an adjudicating officer or by an appropriate commission with a provision for further appeal to this Court and prescription of special limitation for filing appeals under Sections 111 and 125 is to ensure that disputes emanating from the operation and implementation of different provisions of the Electricity Act are expeditiously decided by an expert body and no court, except this Court, may entertain challenge to the decision or order of the Tribunal. The exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil courts (Section 145) qua an order made by an adjudicating officer is also a pointer in that direction. It is thus 17 evident that the Electricity Act is a special legislation within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the [Limitation Act], which lays down that where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the one prescribed by the Schedule, the provisions of Section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) shall apply for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application unless they are not expressly excluded by the special or local law.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 12\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court interpreted Section 29(2) of the [Limitation Act] in the backdrop of the plea that the provisions of that Act are not applicable to the proceedings under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. It was argued that the words \"expressly excluded\" appearing in Section 29(2) would mean that there must be an express reference made in the special or local law to the specific provisions of the [Limitation Act] of which the operation is to be excluded. While rejecting the argument, the three-Judge Bench observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 44: \"...........what we have to see is whether the scheme of the special law, that is in this case the Act, and the nature of the remedy provided therein are such that the Legislature intended it to be a complete code by itself which alone should govern the 18 several matters provided by it. If on an examination of the relevant provisions it is clear that the provisions of the [Limitation Act] are necessarily excluded, then the benefits conferred therein cannot be called in aid to supplement the provisions of the Act. In our view, even in a case where the special law does not exclude the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the [Limitation Act] by an express reference, it would nonetheless be open to the Court to examine whether and to what extent the nature of those provisions or the nature of the subject-matter and scheme of the special law exclude their operation.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 45: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 13\\. Section 34(3) of the [Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996], which is substantially similar to Section 125 of the Electricity Act came to be interpreted in [?CITATION?]. The precise question considered in that case was whether the provisions of Section 5 of the [Limitation Act] are applicable to an application challenging an award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The two-Judge Bench referred to earlier decisions in [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and held:\n",
      "Paragraph 47: \"12\\. As far as the language of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial words are \"but not thereafter\" used in the proviso to sub-section (3). In our opinion, this phrase would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 19 29(2) of the [Limitation Act], and would therefore bar the application of Section 5 of that Act. Parliament did not need to go further. To hold that the court could entertain an application to set aside the award beyond the extended period under the proviso, would render the phrase \"but not thereafter\" wholly otiose. No principle of interpretation would justify such a result.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 16\\. Furthermore, Section 34(1) itself provides that recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award \"in accordance with\"\n",
      "Paragraph 49: sub-section (2) and sub-section (3). Sub-section (2) relates to grounds for setting aside an award and is not relevant for our purposes. But an application filed beyond the period mentioned in Section 34, sub-section (3) would not be an application \"in accordance with\" that sub-section. Consequently by virtue of Section 34(1), recourse to the court against an arbitral award cannot be made beyond the period prescribed. The importance of the period fixed under Section 34 is emphasised by the provisions of Section 36 which provide that \"where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under Section 34 has expired ... the award shall be enforced under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court\".\n",
      "Paragraph 50: This is a significant departure from the provisions of the [Arbitration Act, 1940]. Under the 1940 Act, after the time to set aside the award expired, the court was required to \"proceed to pronounce judgment according to the award, and upon the judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow\" (Section 17).\n",
      "Paragraph 51: Now the consequence of the time expiring under Section 34 of the 1996 Act is that the award becomes immediately enforceable without any further act of the court. If there were any residual doubt on the interpretation of the language used in Section 34, the scheme of the 1996 Act would resolve the issue in favour of curtailment of the court's powers by the exclusion of the operation of Section 5 of the [Limitation Act].\"\n",
      "Paragraph 52: (emphasis supplied) 20\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 14\\. In Singh Enterprises v. C.C.E., Jamshedpur and others (supra), the Court interpreted Section 35 of Central Excise Act, 1944, which is pari materia to Section 125 of the Electricity Act and observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 54: \"The Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals) as also the Tribunal being creatures of statute are vested with jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond the permissible period provided under the statute. The period up to which the prayer for condonation can be accepted is statutorily provided. It was submitted that the logic of Section 5 of the [Limitation Act, 1963] (in short \"the [Limitation Act]\") can be availed for condonation of delay. The first proviso to Section 35 makes the position clear that the appeal has to be preferred within three months from the date of communication to him of the decision or order. However, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from presenting the appeal within the aforesaid period of 60 days, he can allow it to be presented within a further period of 30 days. In other words, this clearly shows that the appeal has to be filed within 60 days but in terms of the proviso further 30 days' time can be granted by the appellate authority to entertain the appeal. The proviso to sub- section (1) of Section 35 makes the position crystal clear that the appellate authority has no power to allow the appeal to be presented beyond the period of 30 days. The language used makes the position clear that the legislature intended the appellate authority to entertain the appeal by condoning delay only up to 30 days after the expiry of 60 days which is the normal period for preferring appeal. Therefore, there is complete exclusion of Section 5 of the [Limitation Act]. The Commissioner and the High Court were therefore justified in holding that there was no power to condone the delay after the expiry of 30 days' period.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 55: (emphasis supplied) The same view was reiterated in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 21\n",
      "Paragraph 57: 15\\. In [?CITATION?], a three-Judge Bench considered the scheme of the Central Excise Act, 1944 and held that High Court has no power to condone delay beyond the period specified in Section 35-H thereof. The argument that Section 5 of the [Limitation Act] can be invoked for condonation of delay was rejected by the Court and observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 58: \"30\\. In the earlier part of our order, we have adverted to Chapter VI-A of the Act which provides for appeals and revisions to various authorities. Though Parliament has specifically provided an additional period of 30 days in the case of appeal to the Commissioner, it is silent about the number of days if there is sufficient cause in the case of an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal. Also an additional period of 90 days in the case of revision by the Central Government has been provided.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: However, in the case of an appeal to the High Court under Section 35-G and reference application to the High Court under Section 35-H, Parliament has provided only 180 days and no further period for filing an appeal and making reference to the High Court is mentioned in the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 32\\. As pointed out earlier, the language used in Sections 35, 35- B, 35-EE, 35-G and 35-H makes the position clear that an appeal and reference to the High Court should be made within 180 days only from the date of communication of the decision or order. In other words, the language used in other provisions makes the position clear that the legislature intended the appellate authority to entertain the appeal by condoning the delay only up to 30 days after expiry of 60 days which is the preliminary limitation period for preferring an appeal. In the absence of any clause condoning the delay by showing sufficient cause after the prescribed period, there is complete 22 exclusion of Section 5 of the [Limitation Act]. The High Court was, therefore, justified in holding that there was no power to condone the delay after expiry of the prescribed period of 180 days.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 35\\. It was contended before us that the words \"expressly excluded\" would mean that there must be an express reference made in the special or local law to the specific provisions of the [Limitation Act] of which the operation is to be excluded. In this regard, we have to see the scheme of the special law which here in this case is the Central Excise Act. The nature of the remedy provided therein is such that the legislature intended it to be a complete code by itself which alone should govern the several matters provided by it. If, on an examination of the relevant provisions, it is clear that the provisions of the [Limitation Act] are necessarily excluded, then the benefits conferred therein cannot be called in aid to supplement the provisions of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: In our considered view, that even in a case where the special law does not exclude the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the [Limitation Act] by an express reference, it would nonetheless be open to the court to examine whether and to what extent, the nature of those provisions or the nature of the subject- matter and scheme of the special law exclude their operation. In other words, the applicability of the provisions of the [Limitation Act], therefore, is to be judged not from the terms of the Limitation Act but by the provisions of the Central Excise Act relating to filing of reference application to the High Court.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 63: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 16\\. In view of the above discussion, we hold that Section 5 of the [Limitation Act] cannot be invoked by this Court for entertaining an appeal filed against the decision or order of the Tribunal beyond the period of 120 days specified in Section 125 of the Electricity Act and its proviso. Any interpretation of Section 125 of the Electricity Act which may attract 23 applicability of Section 5 of the [Limitation Act] read with Section 29(2) thereof will defeat the object of the legislation, namely, to provide special limitation for filing an appeal against the decision or order of the Tribunal and proviso to Section 125 will become nugatory.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 17\\. The judgment in Mukri Gopalan v. Cheppilat Puthanpurayil Aboobacker (supra) on which reliance has been placed by Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad has no bearing on this case. The issue considered in that case was whether Section 5 of the [Limitation Act] can be invoked for condoning the delay in filing an appeal under Section 18 of the Kerala Rent Control Act. A two-Judge Bench interpreted Section 18 of the Kerala Rent Control Act and held that even though that section is a special provision, in the absence of any indication of maximum period within which the appeal can be entertained by the Appellate Authority, Section 5 of the Limitation Act would get attracted. It is significant to note that there is no provision in the Kerala Rent Control Act similar to the one contained in proviso to Section 125 of the Electricity Act, Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and Section 35(1) or 35-H of the Central Excise Act, 1944.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: Therefore, the ratio of Mukri Gopalan v. Cheppilat Puthanpurayil Aboobacker (supra) cannot be invoked for declaring that this Court has the 24 power to entertain an appeal under Section 125 of the Electricity Act after 120 days counted from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Tribunal.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 18\\. The next question which requires consideration is as to what is the date of communication of the decision or order of the Tribunal for the purpose of Section 125 of the Electricity Act. The word `communication' has not been defined in the Act and the Rules. Therefore, the same deserves to be interpreted by applying the rule of contextual interpretation and keeping in view the language of the relevant provisions. Rule 94(1) of the Rules lays down that the Bench of the Tribunal which hears an application or petition shall pronounce the order immediately after conclusion of the hearing. Rule 94(2) deals with a situation where the order is reserved. In that event, the date for pronouncement of order is required to be notified in the cause list and the same is treated as a notice of intimation of pronouncement. Rule 98(1) casts a duty upon the Court Master to immediately after pronouncement transmit the order along with the case file to the Deputy Registrar. In terms of Rule 98(2), the Deputy Registrar is required to scrutinize the file, satisfy himself that provisions of rules have been complied with and thereafter, send the case file to the Registry for taking steps to prepare copies of the order and their communication to the 25 parties. If Rule 98(2) is read in isolation, one may get an impression that the registry of the Tribunal is duty bound to send copies of the order to the parties and the order will be deemed to have been communicated on the date of receipt thereof, but if the same is read in conjunction with Section 125 of the Electricity Act, which enables any aggrieved party to file an appeal within 60 days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Tribunal, Rule 94(2) which postulates notification of the date of pronouncement of the order in the cause list and Rule 106 under which the Tribunal can allow filing of an appeal or petition or application through electronic media and provide for rectification of the defects by e-mail or net, it becomes clear that once the factum of pronouncement of order by the Tribunal is made known to the parties and they are given opportunity to obtain a copy thereof through e-mail etc., the order will be deemed to have been communicated to the parties and the period of 60 days specified in the main part of Section 125 will commence from that date.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: 19\\. The issue deserves to be considered from another angle. As mentioned above, Rule 94(2) requires that when the order is reserved, the date of pronouncement shall be notified in the cause list and that shall be a valid notice of pronouncement of the order. The counsel appearing for the 26 parties are supposed to take cognizance of the cause list in which the case is shown for pronouncement. If title of the case and name of the counsel is printed in the cause list, the same will be deemed as a notice regarding pronouncement of order. Once the order is pronounced after being shown in the cause list with the title of the case and name of the counsel, the same will be deemed to have been communicated to the parties and they can obtain copy through e-mail or by filing an application for certified copy.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 20\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court considered whether an award made under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 can be treated to have been communicated on the date of its making. The application filed by the respondent for making reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act was rejected by the Collector on the ground that the same had been made after more than six months from the date of award i.e., 25.3.1951. The High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant. This Court noted that no notice of the award was given to the appellant as per the requirements of Section 12(2) and it was only on or about January, 1953 that he received the information about making of the award. He then filed application on 24.2.1953 for reference. This Court considered the nature of 27 the award made by the Collector under Section 12(2) and held that the period of six months prescribed for making application would commence from the date the award was made known to the party. Paragraph 6 of the judgment which contains discussion on the issue of communication of award reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 70: \"There is yet another point which leads to the same conclusion.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: If the award is treated as an administrative decision taken by the Collector in the matter of the valuation of the property sought to be acquired it is clear that the said decision ultimately affects the rights of the owner of the property and in that sense, like all decisions which affect persons, it is essentially fair and just that the said decision should be communicated to the said party. The knowledge of the party affected by such a decision, either actual or constructive, is an essential element which must be satisfied before the decision can be brought into force. Thus considered the making of the award cannot consist merely in the physical act of writing the award or signing it or even filing it in the office of the Collector; it must involve the communication of the said award to the party concerned either actually or constructively. If the award is pronounced in the presence of the party whose rights are affected by it it can be said to be made when pronounced. If the date for the pronouncement of the award is communicated to the party and it is accordingly pronounced on the date previously announced the award is said to be communicated to the said party even if the said party is not actually present on the date of its pronouncement. Similarly if without notice of the date of its pronouncement, an award is pronounced and a party is not present the award can be said to be made when it is communicated to the party later. The knowledge of the party affected by the award, either actual or constructive, being an essential requirement of fairplay and natural justice the expression \"the date of the award\" used in the proviso must mean the date when the award is either communicated to the party or is known by him either actually or constructively. In 28 our opinion, therefore, it would be unreasonable to construe the words \"from the date of the Collector's award\" used in the proviso to Section 18 in a literal or mechanical way.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 72: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 73: 21\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court considered a somewhat similar question in the context of filling an appeal under Section 15 of the U.P. Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1935. The Allahabad High Court held that the date of the communication of the order will be the starting point for limitation of filing an appeal. While approving the view taken by the High Court, this Court observed as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 74: \"In our opinion, the judgment of the High Court is right and cannot be interfered with by this Court. Apart from the reasons given by this Court in the earlier judgment to the effect that the order must be made known either directly or constructively to the party affected by the order in order to enable him to prefer an appeal if he so likes, we may give one more reason in our judgment and that is this: It is plain that mere writing an order in the file kept in the office of the Taxation Officer is no order in the eye of law in the sense of affecting the rights of the parties for whom the order is meant. The order must be communicated either directly or constructively in the sense of making it known, which may make it possible for the authority to say that the party affected must be deemed to have known the order. In a given case, the date of putting the order in communication under certain circumstances may be taken to be the date of the communication of the order or the date of the order but ordinarily and generally speaking, the order would be effective against the person affected by it only when it comes to his knowledge either directly or constructively, otherwise not.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 29 On the facts stated in the judgment of the High Court, it is clear that the respondent had no means to know about the order of the Taxation Officer rejecting his prayer until and unless he received his letter on October 29, 1964. Within the meaning of Section 15 of the U.P. Motor Vehicle Taxation Act that was the date of the order which gave the starting point for preferring an appeal within 30 days of that date.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 76: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 22\\. In [?CITATION?], a two-Judge Bench of Madras High Court considered the question whether the limitation of one year prescribed for filing revision under Section 33-A (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 is to be computed from the date when the order was signed by the Income-tax Commissioner or the date on which the petitioner had an opportunity of coming to know of the order. It was argued on behalf of the department that other provisions of the Act have been amended to provide for appeal within specified time to be counted from the date of the receipt of the order sought to be appealed against, but no such amendment was made in Section 33-A and therefore, the period of limitation will start from the date of order. While rejecting the argument, Rajamannar, C.J., referred to earlier decisions in [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] and observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 78: 30 \"...........The only question that we have to decide is as to whether there is anything in the reasoning of the learned Judges in [?CITATION?] & [?CITATION?] which makes the application of the rule laid down by them dependent on the provisions of a particular statute. We think there is none. On the other hand, we consider that the rule laid down by the learned Judges in the above two decisions \\- & we are taking the same view - is based upon a salutary & just principle, namely that, if a person is given a right to resort to the remedy to get rid of an adverse order within a prescribed time, limitation should not be computed from a date earlier than that on which the party aggrieved actually knew of the order or had an opportunity of knowing the order & therefore, must be presumed to have had knowledge of the order.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 79: 23\\. In [?CITATION?], a three-Judge Bench highlighted a distinction between making of an order and communication thereof to the affected person in the context of Section 35-E (3) and (4) of the Central Excise Act, 1944. The Bench noted the scheme of Section 35, distinction between sub-sections (3) and (4) thereof and held that in case where the order is subject to appeal, the same is required to be communicated to the affected person. Relevant portions of that judgment are extracted below:\n",
      "Paragraph 80: \"5\\. Before we discuss the arguments of the learned counsel, it is necessary to set out some relevant provisions in the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: Section 35 of the Act provides for an appeal by a person aggrieved by any decision or order passed under the Act by a Central Excise Officer lower than a Collector of Central Excise 31 and that such an appeal will have to be filed \"within three months from the date of the communication to him of such decision or order\". Sub-section (5) of Section 35-A requires that on the disposal of the appeal, the Collector (Appeals) shall communicate the order passed by him to the appellant, the adjudicating authority and the Collector of Central Excise.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: Section 35-B provides for a right of appeal to any person aggrieved by, among other orders, (1) an order passed by the Collector (Appeals) under Section 35-A and (2) a decision or order passed by the Collector of Central Excise as an adjudicating authority. Such an appeal will have to be filed \"within three months from the date on which the order sought to be appealed against is communicated to the Collector of Central Excise or as the case may be the other party preferring the appeal\". The Appellate Tribunal also is required to send a copy of the order passed in the appeal to the Collector of Central Excise and the other party to the appeal..................\n",
      "Paragraph 83: .....\n",
      "Paragraph 84: 8\\. At this stage itself we may state that sub-section (4) of the Act provides that the adjudicating authority shall file the application before the Tribunal in pursuance of the order made under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) \"within a period of three months from the date of communication of the order under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) to the adjudicating authority\".\n",
      "Paragraph 85: 9\\. The words \"from the date of decision or order\" used with reference to the limitation for filing an appeal or revision under certain statutory provisions had come up for consideration in a number of cases. We may state that the ratio of the decisions uniformly is that in the case of a person aggrieved filing the appeal or revision, it shall mean the date of communication of the decision or order appealed against. However, we may note a few leading cases on this aspect.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: 10\\. Under Section 25 of the Madras Boundary Act, 1860 the starting point of limitation for appeal by way of suit allowed by that section was the passing of the Survey Officer's decision and in two of the earliest cases, namely, Annamalai Chetti v.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: Col. J. G. Cloete and Seshama v. Sankara it was held that the decision was passed when it was communicated to the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: 32 In Secretary of State for India in Council v. Gopisetti Narayanaswami Naidu Garu construing a similar provision in the Survey and Boundary Act, 1897 the same High Court held that a decision cannot properly be said to be passed until it is in some way pronounced or published under such circumstances the parties affected by it have a reasonable opportunity of knowing what it contains. \"Till then though it may be written out, signed and dated, it is nothing but a decision which the officer intends to pass. It is not passed so long it is open to him to tear off what he has written and write something else.\" In Raja Harish Chandra Raj Singh v. Deputy Land Acquisition Officer construing the proviso to Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act which prescribed for applications seeking reference to the court, a time-limit of six weeks of the receipt of the notice from the Collector under Section 12(2) or within six months from the date of the Collector's award whichever first expires, this Court held that the six months period will have to be calculated from the date of communication of the award. In Asstt. Transport Commissioner, Lucknow v. Nand Singh construing the provision of Section 15 of the U.P. Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, it was held that for an aggrieved party the limitation will run from the date when the order was communicated to him.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: 11\\. The ratio of these judgments were applied in interpreting Section 33-A(2) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 in Muthia Chettiar v. CIT with reference to a right of revision provided to an aggrieved assessee. Section 33-A(1) of the Act on the other hand authorised the Commissioner to suo moto call for the records of any proceedings under the Act in which an order has been passed by any authority subordinate to him and pass such order thereon as he thinks fit. The proviso, however, stated that the Commissioner shall not revise any order under that sub- section \"if the order (sought to be revised) has been made more than one year previously\". Construing this provision the High Court in Muthia Chettiar case held that the power to call for the records and pass the order will cease with the lapse of one year from the date of the order by the subordinate authority and the ratio of date of the knowledge of the order applicable to an aggrieved party is not applicable for the purpose of exercising 33 suo moto power. Similarly in another decision reported in Viswanathan Chettiar v. CIT construing the time-limit for completion of an assessment under Section 34(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1922, which provided that it shall be made \"within four years from the end of the year in which the income, profit and gains were first assessable,\" it was held that the time- limit of four years for exercise of the power should be calculated with reference to the date on which the assessment or reassessment was made and not the date on which such assessment or reassessment order made under Section 34(2) was served on the assessee.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: 13\\. So far as the party who is affected by the order or decision for seeking his remedies against the same, he should be made aware of passing of such order. Therefore courts have uniformly laid down as a rule of law that for seeking the remedy the limitation starts from the date on which the order was communicated to him or the date on which it was pronounced or published under such circumstances that the parties affected by it have a reasonable opportunity of knowing of passing of the order and what it contains. The knowledge of the party affected by such a decision, either actual or constructive is thus an essential element which must be satisfied before the decision can be said to have been concluded and binding on him. Otherwise the party affected by it will have no means of obeying the order or acting in conformity with it or of appealing against it or otherwise having it set aside. This is based upon, as observed by Rajmannar, C.J. in Muthia Chettiar v. CIT \"a salutary and just principle\". The application of this rule so far as the aggrieved party is concerned is not dependent on the provisions of the particular statute, but it is so under the general law.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 91: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 92: 24\\. Reverting to the facts of this case, we find that even though the name of the counsel for the appellant was not shown in the cause list of 14.5.2007 i.e., the date on which the impugned order was pronounced by the Tribunal, 34 the factum of pronouncement was conveyed to the parties including the appellant vide letter dated 7.6.2007, which was signed by the Deputy Registrar on 11.6.2007 and they were informed that they can obtain copy through e-mail or make an application for certified copy. Undisputedly, that letter was received in the secretariat of the appellant on 21.6.2007. The appellant had come to know about the impugned order in July 2007 from another source i.e., respondent No.5, which had sent communication for payment of FLEE charges. The communication sent by respondent No.5 was received by the appellant on 17.7.2007. It is, thus, evident that on 21.6.2007 or at least on 17.7.2007, the appellant had come to know through proper channel that the order has been pronounced by the Tribunal in I.A.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: No.4/2007. It is not clear from the record whether the appellant had applied for certified copy or obtained the one through e-mail, but this much is evident that the appellant did obtain/receive a copy of order dated 17.5.2007.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: If that was not so, the appellant could not have filed appeal under Section 125 of the Electricity Act. The preparation of appeal, which bears the date 7.9.2007 is a clinching evidence of the fact that the appellant had not only become aware of the order of the Tribunal, but had obtained copy thereof.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: However, instead of filing appeal within 60 days from the date of receipt of letter dated 7.6.2007 sent by the registry of the Tribunal or the 35 communication sent by respondent No.5, the appellant chose to file appeal only on 24.12.2007 and that too despite the fact that the same was prepared on 7.9.2007. The appellant has not offered any tangible explanation as to why the appeal could not be filed for more than three and half months after its preparation. Thus, there is no escape from the conclusion that the appeal has been filed after more than 120 days from the date of communication of the Tribunal's order and, as such, the same cannot be entertained.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: 25\\. In the result, the appeal is dismissed. However, the parties are left to bear their own costs.\n",

      "Paragraph 5: 2\\. This batch of appeals arise out of a judgment and order dated 23rd June, 2009 passed by a Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court at Guwahati whereby and whereunder the Memorandum dated 11th 3 September, 2003 issued by the Government of Meghalaya purported to be in terms of Section 138 (2)(b) of the [Motor Vehicles Act, 1988] (for short `the Act') was held to be illegal and a writ of or in the nature of mandamus was issued directing the Government of Mehalaya to make Rules in exercise of its powers thereunder.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 3\\. The basic fact of the matter is not in dispute.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: Several writ petitions were filed before the High Court alleging that trucks carrying cargo in the State of Meghalaya are compelled to pay substantial amounts to various entites at innumerable points who broadly fall under four categories - (1) persons operating weighbridges on various terms and conditions stipulated by the State of Meghalaya ; (2) the local tribal chiefs known as Sylems and Sardars ; (3) the authorities implementing the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and (4) the Police officers of the State of Meghalaya.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: The Sylems and Sardars being the local tribal chiefs, admitted establishment of such toll gates and collection of monies from the cargo carrying vehicles asserting customary rights in them therefor and which are said to be protected by Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India and the laws made by the District Council thereunder.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 4 Indisputably a batch of the writ petitions including the connected appeals relating to the right of Sylems and Sardars who established Toll Gates and collection of monies by them, had been heard in part by the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 5 It is also not in dispute that various interim orders were passed in the said pending mattes. The Gauhati High Court, however, took up for hearing a batch of six matters in regard to the legality of collection of monies by the operators of the weighbridges in the State of Meghalaya opining that the purported grievances made 6 in the other writ petitions relating to establishment of toll gates and collection of monies by other agencies could be determined later.\n",

It may also be stated that so far illegal collection of tolls by the Respondent No. 6 is concerned; no Motor Vehicle Inspector has been posted in the Check gates as mentioned in the petition. As such illegal collection or extortion by the said person from the Members of the Petitioner's Association does not arise. The statements made in the petition are general statements containing wild allegations and the same are vague in nature. Whenever, any such complaint was received by the authority regarding any collection of illegal tolls, necessary steps were taken in the matter by the District Administration.\"\n",

      "Paragraph 37: 11\\. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants would contend that the appellants have preferred these appeals against the impugned judgment because in absence of any valid receipt granted to them by the authorized weighbridge owners, they would not be permitted to carry on inter-state transport business and thus their right under Article 301 of the Constitution would be violated.\n",

They read as under :- \"1\\. This procedure shall be followed by the Transport Department for granting of permission of installation and operation of Weigh Bridge for commercial and regulatory purposes.\n",

      "Paragraph 47: 14\\. Indisputably an interim order was passed on 11th June, 2008 directing stoppage of collection of monies from the truck owners/drivers by the various local tribal chiefs. Pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof the Deputy Commissioner, West Khasi Hills, District of 11 Meghalaya issued an order dated 20th February, 2009 directing the said persons to remove/stop all the illegal Toll gates/Check gates/Weigh Bridge on public roads and stop collection of illegal tolls therein immediately within one week from the date of issue of the said letter.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 15\\. Writ petitions were filed thereagainst and a learned Single Judge of the High Court kept the said stay order in abeyance during the pendency of the writ petitions. Writ appeals preferred thereagainst are pending before the Division Bench of the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: 16\\. As indicated heretobefore although various questions were raised in the writ petitions filed by the Association of the Coal Dealers and Truck Owner as also by tribal chiefs, the High Court thought it fit not to go into other questions except the one involved in these appeals.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 17\\. It is not in dispute that the Act in unequivocal terms provides to specify among other things the weight which a carrier of a given description may carry. The said provisions are necessary not only for construction and maintenance of road but also to prevent accidents.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 18\\. The Act provides for registration of the Motor Vehicles in terms of the provisions contained in Chapter IV of the Act. Section 41 prescribes that an application therefor is required to be accompanied by such documents, particulars and information and shall be made within such 12 period as may be prescribed by the Central Government. In terms of Section 58 of the said Act, the Central Government is authorized to notify the gross vehicle weight, and axle weight of certain types of transport vehicles.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: Sub-section (3) of Section 113 of the Act prohibits any person to drive or cause or allow to be driven in any public place any motor vehicle \\- (a) the unladen weight of which exceeds the unladen weight specified in the certificate of registration and (b) the laden weight of which exceeds the gross vehicle weight specified in the certificate of registration.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 19\\. Section 114 of the Act, which is relevant for our purpose, reads as under:- \"114\\. Power to have vehicle weighed.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: (1) Any officer of the Motor Vehicles Department authorised in this behalf by the State Government shall, if he has reason to believe that a goods vehicle or trailer is being used in contravention of section 113,] require the driver to convey the vehicle to a weighing device, if any, within a distance of ten kilometres from any point on the forward route or within a distance of twenty kilometres from the destination of the vehicle for weighment;\n",
      "Paragraph 55: and if on such weighment the vehicle is found to contravene in any respect the provisions of section 113 regarding weight, he may, by order in writing, direct the driver to off-load the excess weight at his own risk and not to remove the vehicle or trailer from that place until the 13 laden weight has been reduced or the vehicle or trailer has otherwise been dealt with so that it complies with section 113 and on receipt of such notice, the driver shall comply with such directions.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: (2) Where the person authorised under sub- section (1) makes the said order in writing, he shall also endorse the relevant details of the overloading on the goods carriage permit and also intimate the fact of such endorsement to the authority which issued that permit.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 57: 20\\. Section 138 of the said Act empowers the State Government to make rules. Sub-section 2(b) thereof states that such rules may provide for \"the installation and use of weighing devices\".\n",
      "Paragraph 58: Section 194 of the said Act reads as under :- \"194\\. Driving vehicle exceeding permissible weight. (1) Whoever drives a motor vehicle or causes or allows a motor vehicle to be driven in contravention of the provisions of section 113 or section 114 or section 115 shall be punishable with minimum fine of two thousand rupees and an additional amount of one thousand rupees per tonne of excess load, together with the liability to pay charges for off-loading of the excess load.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: (2) Any driver of a vehicle who refuses to stop and submit his vehicle to weighing after being directed to do so by an officer authorised in this behalf under section 114 or removes or causes the removal of the load or part of it prior to weighing shall be punishable with fine which may extend to three thousand rupees.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 14 Section 211 of the Act provides for power to levy fee.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: It reads :- \"211\\. Power to levy fee.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: Any rule which the Central Government or the State Government is empowered to make under this Act may, notwithstanding the absence of any express provision to that effect, provide for the levy of such fees in respect of applications, amendment of documents, issue of certificates, licences, permits, tests, endorsements, badges, plates, countersignatures, authorisation, supply of statistics or copies of documents or orders and for any other purpose or matter involving the rendering of any service by the officers or authorities under this Act or any rule made thereunder as may be considered necessary:\n",
      "Paragraph 63: Provided that the Government may, if it considers necessary so to do, in the public interest by general or special order, exempt any class of persons from the payment of any such fee either in part or in full.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 64: Section 212 provides for publication, commencement and laying of rules and notifications. Sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) thereof read as under:- \"212\\. Publication, commencement and laying of rules and notifications.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 15 (1) The power to make rules under this Act is subject to the condition of the rules being made after previous publication.\n",

      "Paragraph 67: (3) Every rule made by any State Government shall be laid, as soon as may be after it is made before the State Legislature.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 68: 21\\. We may at this juncture also notice the provisions of Section 23 of the [General Clauses Act, 1897] which reads :-\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 23\\. Provisions applicable to making of rules or bye-laws after previous publication.- Where, by any (Central Act) or Regulation, a power to make rules or bye-laws is expressed to be given subject to the condition of the rules or bye-laws being made after previous publication, then the following provisions shall apply, namely:- (1) the authority having power to make the rules or bye- laws shall, before making them, publish a draft of the proposed rules or bye- laws for the information of person likely to be affected thereby.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: (2) the publication shall be made in such manner as that authority deems to be sufficient, or, if the condition with respect to previous publication so requires, in such manner as the (Government concerned) prescribed.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: (3) there shall be published with the draft a notice specifying a date on after which the draft will be taken into consideration.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: 16 (4) the authority having power to make the rules or bye-laws , and where the rules or bye-laws are to be made with the sanction, approval or concurrence of another authority, that authority also, shall consider any objection or suggestion which may me received by the authority having power to make the rules or bye-laws from any person with respect to the draft before the date so specified.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: (5) the publication in the (Official Gazette) of a rule or bye-law purporting to have been made in exercise of a power to make rules or bye-laws after previous publication shall be conclusive proof that the rule or bye-law has been duly made.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 74: 22\\. The core question which arises for consideration in these appeals is as to whether the State Government is empowered to issue any executive order in respect of the matters required to be prescribed by Rules.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 23\\. Article 162 of the Constitution of India in unequivocal terms provides that the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws. Such executive powers having regard to the Rule of Executive Business are framed in terms of Article 166. Clause (3) of Article 166 empowers the Governor to make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of the State, and for the allocation among Minister of the said business in so far as it is not business with respect to which the Governor is by or under the Constitution required to act in his discretion.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 17\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 24\\. The Memorandum was issued in the name of the Governor. It is not in dispute that it was authenticated in terms of clause (2) of Article 166 of the Constitution. The power was exercised by the State under the provisions of the Act. The said order was to remain in force till Rules are framed in the prescribed manner.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: The provisions of the Act mandate that the unladen weight and laden weight must be determined. Indisputably, weighing devices had to be provided for the said purpose. It is true that for the said purpose Rules may have to be framed. It is, however, a well settled principle of law that even in a case where the statute provides for certain things to be done, subject to Rules, any action taken without framing the Rules would not render any action invalid. If a statute is workable even without framing of the Rules, the same has to be given effect to. The law itself except in certain situations does not envisage vacuum.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: 25\\. Non compliance of the provisions relating to \"laden weight\" and \"unladen weight\" being penal in nature must be held to be imperative in character. For the purpose of construction of the provisions of the Act the Courts will have to take into consideration the freedom on the part of the citizens as also non citizens to carry out trade and business in terms of 18 Article 301 of the Constitution of India, subject of course to the other provisions thereof.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 26\\. The High Court itself noticed the two primary contentions of the writ petition for its consideration, which read :- \"Essentially the grievances in these cases is two fold - (1) the State lacks the necessary authority of law to collect such fee and (2) even if the authority in law exists, that those who are entrusted with the responsibility of rendering the services and collecting the fee are acting in excess of the authority conferred on them.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 81: 27\\. The second contention was not answered.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: In fact there was no sufficient pleadings brought on record by the parties in that behalf. The State for giving effect to the provisions of the statute may upon itself take the burden of providing for weighbridges and collection of fees etc. in exercise of its power under Article 298 or Article 162 of the Constitution of India. It may, however, permit to provide parties to install weighbridges, subject to regulations.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: 28\\. The Memorandum in question provides broad terms and conditions under which the private parties were authorized to set up weighbridges and collection of fees. Power of the State to do so is not in question. It is not a 19 case where fees are required to be prescribed for undertaking administrative action.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: 29\\. Apart from Section 211 of the Act the State is entitled to make laws for collection of fees in respect of any manner enumerated in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India as would be evident from Entry 66 thereof. If it itself carries on business, it is entitled to lay down the norms therefor.\n",
      "Paragraph 85: 30\\. Where the State or the State controlled agencies render services for the purpose of effectuation of the provisions of a Central Act, it, in our opinion, is entitled to charge a reasonable amount in respect thereof.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: 31\\. We may, in this behalf, refer to a decision of this Court in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] The question which arose for consideration therein was as to whether in absence of any law regulating the appointment and succession of Chiefs and Headmen, a notice issued to the respondent therein to show cause as to why he should not be removed from his office, was valid. The respondent questioned the said legality of the show cause notice as also the order of suspension passed against him on the grounds :- \"(i) That he could not be removed by administrative orders but only by making a law ;\n",
      "Paragraph 87: 20 (ii) that the Executive Committee could not take any action in this case, and (iii) that the order of suspension was ultra vires.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 88: Wanchoo, J. speaking for the Court opined as under :- \"The High Court seems to be of the view that until such a law is made there could be no power of appointment of a Chief or Siem like the respondent and in consequence there would be no power of removal either. With respect, it seems to us that the High Court has read far more into para 3(1)(g) than is justified by its language. Para 3(1) is in fact something like a legislative list and enumerates the subjects on which the District Council is competent to make laws. Under para 3(1)(g) it has power to make laws with respect to the appointment or succession of Chiefs or Headmen and this would naturally include the power to remove them. But it does not follow from this that the appointment or removal of a Chief is a legislative act or that no appointment or removal can be made without there being first a law to that effect. The High Court also seems to have thought that as there was no provision in the Sixth Schedule in terms of Articles 73 and 162 of the Constitution, the administrative power of the District Council would not extend to the subjects enumerated in para 3(1). Now para 2(4) provides that the administration of an autonomous district shall vest in the District Council and this in our opinion is comprehensive enough to include all such executive powers as are necessary to be exercised for the purposes of the administration of the district. It is true that where executive power impinges upon the rights of citizens it will have to be backed by an appropriate law; but where executive power is concerned only with the 21 personnel of the administration it is not necessary \\-- even though it may be desirable -- that there must be laws, rules or regulations governing the appointment of those who would carry on the administration under the control of the District Council. \"\n",
      "Paragraph 89: The said decision has been noticed by this Court in [?CITATION?] It was held therein:- \"6\\. The High Court has held that the disposal of property forming part of the compensation pool was \"subject\" to the rules framed as contemplated by Sections 8 and 40 of the Act and since no rules had been framed by the Central Government with regard to the disposal of the urban agricultural property forming part of the compensation pool, the authority constituted under the Act had no jurisdiction to dispose of urban agricultural property by auction-sale.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: Unless rules were framed as contemplated by the Act, according to the High Court the Central Government had no authority in law to issue executive directions for the sale and disposal of urban agricultural property. This view was taken, placing reliance on an earlier decision of a Division Bench of that court in Bishan Singh v. Central Government. The Division Bench in Bishan case took the view that since the disposal of the compensation pool property was subject to the rules that may be made, and as no rules had been framed, the Central Government had no authority in law to issue administrative directions providing for the transfer of the urban agricultural land by auction-sale. In our opinion the view taken by the High Court is incorrect. Where a statute confers powers on an authority to do certain acts or exercise power in respect of certain matters, subject to rules, the exercise of power conferred by the statute does not depend on the existence of rules unless the statute 22 expressly provides for the same. In other words framing of the rules is not condition precedent to the exercise of the power expressly and unconditionally conferred by the statute. The expression \"subject to the rules\" only means, in accordance with the rules, if any. If rules are framed, the powers so conferred on authority could be exercised in accordance with these rules. But if no rules are framed there is no void and the authority is not precluded from exercising the power conferred by the statute.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 91: 32\\. Mr. Sharma would lay emphasis on the opinion of the Bench in Cajee (supra) that executive power infringing upon the rights of the citizens would have to be backed by appropriate law.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: The aforementioned observation was made in the context of the Constitutional provisions contained in the Sixth Schedule.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: There exists a distinction between an executive order made in terms of Articles 73 and 162 of the Constitution of India and one made under the Sixth Schedule thereof.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: Furthermore the levy of charges towards rendering services by itself does not infringe upon the right of any person.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: 33\\. Services of the weighbridges are required to be obtained by the drivers/owners of the trucks for fulfillment of their statutory obligations.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: 23 They cannot obtain such services free of any charges. When private parties are given the right to set up such weighbridges, indisputably they would be entitled to reasonable profit.\n",
      "Paragraph 97: It was not the contention of the writ petitioner-respondent that the charges levied for getting their trucks weighed at the weighbridges are exorbitant or they are compelled to get their trucks weighed at several places, although they otherwise fulfill the statutory requirements laid down in Section 211 of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 98: 34\\. Our attention has been drawn by Mr. Sharma to a decision of this Court in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 99: \"44\\. Coming now to fees, a \"fee\" is generally defined to be a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by some governmental agency. The amount of fee levied is supposed to be based on the expenses incurred by the Government in rendering the service, though in many cases the costs are arbitrarily assessed. Ordinarily, the fees are uniform and no account is taken of the varying abilities of different recipients to pay. These are undoubtedly some of the general characteristics, but as there may be various kinds of fees, it is not possible to formulate a definition that would be applicable to all cases.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 100: The ratio laid down therein is not in dispute.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: 24\n",
      "Paragraph 102: 35\\. We may, however, notice that the question has been considered by a Constitution Bench of this Court in [?CITATION?]. The Bench noticed the difference between `a tax' `a fee' and `a compensatory tax\" inter alia in the following terms :- \"40\\. Tax is levied as a part of common burden.\n",
      "Paragraph 103: The basis of a tax is the ability or the capacity of the taxpayer to pay. The principle behind the levy of a tax is the principle of ability or capacity. In the case of a tax, there is no identification of a specific benefit and even if such identification is there, it is not capable of direct measurement. In the case of a tax, a particular advantage, if it exists at all, is incidental to the State's action. It is assessed on certain elements of business, such as, manufacture, purchase, sale, consumption, use, capital, etc. but its payment is not a condition precedent. It is not a term or condition of a licence. A fee is generally a term of a licence. A tax is a payment where the special benefit, if any, is converted into common burden.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: 41\\. On the other hand, a fee is based on the \"principle of equivalence\". This principle is the converse of the \"principle of ability\" to pay. In the case of a fee or compensatory tax, the \"principle of equivalence\" applies. The basis of a fee or a compensatory tax is the same. The main basis of a fee or a compensatory tax is the quantifiable and measurable benefit. In the case of a tax, even if there is any benefit, the same is incidental to the government action and even if such benefit results 25 from the government action, the same is not measurable. Under the principle of equivalence, as applicable to a fee or a compensatory tax, there is an indication of a quantifiable data, namely, a benefit which is measurable.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 105: [See also [?CITATION?] ].\n",
      "Paragraph 106: 36\\. Although not very relevant, we may notice that this Court in [?CITATION?] has held that even the draft rules may be followed where no rules in accordance with the statutory provisions have been framed. {See also [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]}.\n",
      "Paragraph 107: 37\\. Mr. Ranjit Kumar relying on the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?], would contend that the High Court had no jurisdiction to direct State to frame Rules. We need no go into the said question as before us Mr.Ranjan Mukherjee, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Meghalaya made a categorical statement that the Rules would be framed within eight weeks.\n",
      "Paragraph 108: 26\n",
      "Paragraph 109: 38\\. This Court in Surinder Singh (supra) opined that a copy of the order must be produced before the High Court before the same can be quashed.\n",
      "Paragraph 110: The validity of an order issued by the State Government, furthermore should be questioned by a person aggrieved upon raising grounds therefor. The State must be given an opportunity to file a counter-affidavit meeting those grounds.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: 39\\. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. The same is, therefore, set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: 40\\. The writ petitioners, however, would be at liberty to file additional affidavit (s) questioning the validity or otherwise of the said Memorandum.\n",
      "Paragraph 113: The High Court must also give an opportunity to the State and other interested parties to present their respective cases before the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: 41\\. The High Court in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case may also consider the desirability of consideration of the matters pending before it together, if not already disposed of, so that the points raised by the writ-petitioners may be dealt with comprehensively.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: 1\\. Leave granted.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: 2\\. The short question that falls for determination in this appeal is whether the respondent-Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (for short BSNL) could have blacklisted the appellant for allotment of future contracts for all times to come. High Court of Judicature at Bombay before whom the blacklisting order was assailed by the appellant has answered that question in the affirmative and dismissed Writ Petition No.2289 of 2011 filed by the appellant giving rise to the present appeal.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 3\\. Two tender notices for supply of Permanent Lubricated HDPE Pipe (Telecom Ducts) and Installation of O.F. Cable through Blowing Technique were issued by BSNL in the year 2004 and 2005. It is common ground that the appellant-company emerged successful in regard to both the tender notices.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: It is also not in dispute that several orders for supply of the material were placed with the appellant-company during the years 2004-2006 and that goods were supplied to various consignee units of BSNL pursuant to the same. The appellants case is that a receipt certificate was issued in its favour after delivery of the goods and that bills for payment of the price of the goods were raised in triplicate to the Chief Controller of Accounts, WTP BSNL, Mumbai from time to time. The appellants further case is that a single account to receive 95% of the payment due from BSNL was maintained by it and since the amounts received from the respondent-BSNL by cheques did not carry any particulars of the consignment for which such payment was being made it could, in no way, discover excess payment, if any, released by BSNL against the bills sent by the appellant.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 4\\. The appellants further case is that on gaining knowledge about the excess payments received by it, an offer for reconciliation of the accounts was made to the BSNL and since any such reconciliation was likely to take 30 to 45 days, the appellant offered to adjust the excess amount credited to its account towards the outstanding bills on an ad hoc basis. A letter dated 10th May, 2006 was, according to the appellant, addressed to the respondent-BSNL in that regard.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 5\\. The respondent-BSNL on the other hand has a different story to tell.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: According to it four of its officers had abused their official position and fraudulently generated 'voucher numbers' on the duplicate and triplicate copies of the bills submitted by the appellant to facilitate payments as if the said bills were genuine thereby causing wrongful loss to the respondent- BSNL and a corresponding gain to the appellant. There was in this process an excess payment of Rs.7.98 crores made and credited to the account of the appellant by the accounts officer of respondent-BSNL.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 6\\. Taking note of the fraudulent payments made to the appellant, the BSNL lodged an FIR with CBI ACB Mumbai against one of its Senior Accounts Officers and a Director of the appellant-company alleging commission of offences punishable under Section 120B read with Section 420 Indian Penal Code and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Investigation that followed has culminated in a charge-sheet filed before the Special Judge for CBI cases, Bombay in which four officials of the BSNL including D. Tripathi-Senior Accounts Officer, Laxman Dixit-Assistant Accounts Officer, Krishnakumari Patnaik-Junior Accounts Officer, Poolchand Yadav-Cashier and Lalit Gupta-Director and Bhavani Sharma-Consultant of the appellant-company have been arraigned as accused persons.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 7\\. What is important for the present is that by a letter dated 21st April, 2010, BSNL blacklisted the appellant permanently on the ground that the appellant had committed gross misconduct and irregularities by receiving excessive payments amounting to Rs.7,98,55,508/- from BSNL thereby wrongfully causing loss to the said company. The appellant denied these allegations, inter alia, contending that BSNL Policy/Manual did not provide for punitive action in the nature of blacklisting and that excess payment at best was an irregularity which had been cured by refund of the amount in question. The appellant also alleged that reconciliation of accounts revealed that the appellant was entitled to an amount, far in excess of the payments received by it. That assertion was repeated in a legal notice sent by the appellant- company but since BSNL took no corrective action in terms of the reconciliation, W.P. No.4536 of 2010 was filed before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in which it assailed the blacklisting order. The High Court allowed the petition on the short ground that the appellant had not been afforded any opportunity of being heard before the blacklisting order was issued by the respondent. The High Court did not go into the merits of the dispute but reserved liberty to the appellant to raise all such contentions as were open to it if and when BSNL issued a show cause notice for blacklisting it again. The BSNL was left free to pass a fresh order and take a final decision in the matter within six weeks from the date of the issue of the show cause notice.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 8\\. A show cause notice was accordingly issued by BSNL on 4th November, 2010 to which the appellant filed a reply. The appellant was also called for a personal hearing in support of its reply to the show cause notice as directed by the High Court. By an order dated 15th January, 2011 BSNL once again directed the blacklisting of the appellant, inter alia, holding that the appellant had defrauded BSNL by using duplicate and triplicate copies of the bills that stood already cleared for payment. These bogus and fraudulent claims made under bogus and fabricated bills were then processed by some of the officers of the BSNL for payment resulting in double and at times triple payment in favour of the appellant. The relevant portion of the blacklisting order is to the following effect:\n",
      "Paragraph 11: Hence, the supplier with a clear intention to defraud BSNL, WTP, Mumbai, have prepared duplicate and triplicate copies of bills already processed for payment and have again put up the same for payment with BSNL. Thus, in short these were bogus and/or fraudulent claims made on the basis of forged and/or fabricated bills/documents. Thereafter, by joining hands with some of the erring officers of BSNL, the supplier has got the afore mentioned duplicate and triplicate copies of bills processed for payment and have fraudulently received double/triple payment(s) for supplying material only once.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: Therefore, by not only claiming but also receiving double and/or triple payment on the basis of forged/fabricated/duplicate and triplicate copies of same bills, the supplier has committed gross fraud on the public exchequer.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: The fraudulent act on the part of supplier got completed by not only claiming such bogus payments but also by receiving the same from BSNL. Moreover, by letter dated 10th May, 2006, the supplier has not only acknowledged but have also accepted the fact of claiming as also accepting aforesaid bogus payments and hence the supplier had agreed for reconciliation of same after deducting such bogus payments. If the accounts would not have reconciled, the supplier would have caused huge losses to the public exchequer.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: Hence, there is every apprehension that if the supplier is allowed to deal in any manner with the BSNL in future, the supplier will venture into committing same and/or similar fraud (s) on the public exchequer and therefore, it is not at all in the interest of public exchequer that the supplier continues to be authorised supplier of BSNL.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: Hence, in view of the all the above facts and circumstances and the entire record and proceedings of this case, it is possible for this organisation to take a view to permanent banning and impose penalty upon the supplier so as to prevent the supplier from dealing with entire BSNL, throughout the country in any manner, consequently stopping all the future business transactions of entire BSNL with the supplier.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: Hereby M/s. Kulja Industries Ltd., Solan (Himachal Pradesh) is permanently banned and is consequently prevented from having any business dealing with entire BSNL through the country.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: This is issued with the approval of the competent authority.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Sd/- AGM (MM) 15.1.2011 O/o CGM, WTP, Mumbai-54\n",
      "Paragraph 19: 9\\. Aggrieved by the above order the appellant once again approached the High Court in W.P. No. 2289 of 2011 which was heard and dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court in terms of the order impugned in this appeal. The High Court was of the opinion that reconciliation of the account had proved that the appellant had received payment twice over for the supplies made by it and that merely because the excess payment received had been subsequently refunded by the appellant did not obliterate the act of misconduct and fraud. The High Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 20: In the order impugned, the Authority has stated that on the reconciliation of the account, it was found as a fact that the Petitioner has received payment twice for the supply of the same material, because the supply was ongoing and the amount was found to be payable to the Petitioner, that was paid to him.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: Mere payment of the amount does not wipe out the fact that the Petitioner had submitted the Bills claiming double payment. In our opinion, in view of this finding, no interference is called for in the order impugned. The Petition is rejected. No costs.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 10\\. The present appeal calls in question the correctness of the above order of the High Court as noticed earlier.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: 11\\. Appearing for the appellant-company, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, strenuously argued that debarring the appellant permanently and for all times to come was wholly arbitrary and unjustified. It was contended that the blacklisting order had serious civil consequences for the person blacklisted making it obligatory for the Authority passing the order to act fairly and reasonably. Inasmuch as respondent-BSNL had blacklisted the appellant permanently, the decision was neither fair nor reasonable. Paras 31 and 32 of the bid document also, according to the learned counsel, provides for blacklisting only for a suitable period. This implies that blacklisting had to be for a definite period and not for all times to come.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: Since the products manufactured by the appellant were mostly, if not entirely, supplied for consumption to the respondent-BSNL, any order permanently blacklisting the appellant from entering into contracts making supplies was tantamount to rendering the appellant jobless and economically defunct. No such order of blacklisting could, therefore, be sustained as the punishment implicit in such an order was totally disproportionate to the gravity of the offence allegedly committed by the appellant.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: 12\\. On behalf of the respondent-BSNL, it was argued by Mr. Bansal that the blacklisting order under challenge was not relatable to paras 31 and 32 of the bid document. The order simply declared the petitioner-company ineligible for allotment of any contract in future in terms of para 2.3 of the tender document, the relevant portion wherefore reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 2.3 Disqualification Clause: The supplier/ Manufacturers in the following category are not eligible to bid in the said tender.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: i ....\n",
      "Paragraph 28: ii. Firms against whom investigation cases are registered with the CBI or other statutory investigations agencies of State/Central Govt.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: iii ....\n",
      "Paragraph 30: 13\\. It was further contended by the learned counsel that even if the order was held to be referable to paras 31 and 32 of the bid document, an order permanently blacklisting the appellant was also justified having regard to the nature of the fraud committed by it in collusion with the officers of the respondent-corporation and involving a huge amount of nearly eight crores.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: 14\\. We may at the outset deal with the contention whether paras 31 and 32 of the bid document to which Mr. Rohtagi has made reference is the only source of the power to blacklist a defaulting contractor. These paras are as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 31. Purchaser reserves the right to disqualify the supplier for a suitable period who habitually failed to supply the equipment in time. Further, the suppliers whose equipment do not perform satisfactory in the field in accordance with the specifications may also be disqualified for a suitable period as decided by the purchaser.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 32\\. Purchaser reserves the right to blacklist a bidder for a suitable period in case he fails to honour his bid without sufficient grounds.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: 15\\. A plain reading of the above would show that BSNL, the purchaser has reserved the right to disqualify any supplier who (a) habitually fails to supply the equipment in time or (b) the equipment supplied by the supplier does not perform satisfactory in the field in accordance with the specifications or (c) fails to honour his bid without sufficient grounds.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 16\\. A literal construction of the provisions of paras 31 and 32 extracted above would mean that the power to disqualify or blacklist a supplier is available to the purchaser only in the three situations enumerated in paras 31 and 32 and no other. Any such interpretation would, however, give rise to anomalous results. We say so because in cases where a supplier is found guilty of much graver offences, failures or violations, resulting in much heavier losses and greater detriment to the purchasers in terms of money, reputation or prejudice to public interest may go unpunished simply because all such acts of fraud, misrepresentation or the like have not been specifically enumerated as grounds for blacklisting of the supplier in paras 31 and 32 of the tender document. That could in our opinion never be the true intention of the purchaser when it stipulated paras 31 and 32 as conditions of the tender document by which the purchaser has reserved to itself the right to disqualify or blacklist bidders for breach or violation committed by them. If bidders who commit a breach of a lesser degree could be punished by an order of blacklisting there is no reason why a breach of a more serious nature should go unpunished, be ignored or rendered inconsequential by reason only of an omission of such breach or violation in the text of paras 31 and 32 of the tender document. Paras 31 and 32 cannot, in that view, be said to be exhaustive; nor is the power to blacklist limited to situations mentioned therein.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 17\\. That apart the power to blacklist a contractor whether the contract be for supply of material or equipment or for the execution of any other work whatsoever is in our opinion inherent in the party allotting the contract. There is no need for any such power being specifically conferred by statute or reserved by contractor. That is because blacklisting simply signifies a business decision by which the party affected by the breach decides not to enter into any contractual relationship with the party committing the breach. Between two private parties the right to take any such decision is absolute and untrammelled by any constraints whatsoever.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: The freedom to contract or not to contract is unqualified in the case of private parties. But any such decision is subject to judicial review when the same is taken by the State or any of its instrumentalities. This implies that any such decision will be open to scrutiny not only on the touchstone of the principles of natural justice but also on the doctrine of proportionality. A fair hearing to the party being blacklisted thus becomes an essential pre- condition for a proper exercise of the power and a valid order of blacklisting made pursuant thereto. The order itself being reasonable, fair and proportionate to the gravity of the offence is similarly examinable by a writ Court. The legal position on the subject is settled by a long line of decisions rendered by this Court starting with [?CITATION?] where this Court declared that blacklisting has the effect of preventing a person from entering into lawful relationship with the Government for purposes of gains and that the Authority passing any such order was required to give a fair hearing before passing an order blacklisting a certain entity. This Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 20. Blacklisting has the effect of preventing a person from the privilege and advantage of entering into lawful relationship with the Government for purposes of gains. The fact that a disability is created by the order of blacklisting indicates that the relevant authority is to have an objective satisfaction. Fundamentals of fair play require that the person concerned should be given an opportunity to represent his case before he is put on the blacklist. \n",
      "Paragraph 39: 18\\. Subsequent decisions of this Court in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] among others have followed the ratio of that decision and applied the principle of audi alteram partem to the process that may eventually culminate in the blacklisting of a contractor.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 19\\. Even the second facet of the scrutiny which the blacklisting order must suffer is no longer res integra. The decisions of this Court in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] have ruled against arbitrariness and discrimination in every matter that is subject to judicial review before a Writ Court exercising powers under Article 226 or Article 32 of the Constitution. It is also well settled that even though the right of the writ petitioner is in the nature of a contractual right, the manner, the method and the motive behind the decision of the authority whether or not to enter into a contract is subject to judicial review on the touchstone of fairness, relevance, natural justice, non-discrimination, equality and proportionality. All these considerations that go to determine whether the action is sustainable in law have been sanctified by judicial pronouncements of this Court and are of seminal importance in a system that is committed to the rule of law.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: We do not consider it necessary to burden this judgment by a copious reference to the decisions on the subject. A reference to the following passage from the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?] should, in our view, suffice:\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 11. It is well settled that every action of the State or an instrumentality of the State in exercise of its executive power, must be informed by reason. In appropriate cases, actions uninformed by reason may be questioned as arbitrary in proceedings under Article 226 or Article 32 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: Reliance in this connection may be placed on the observations of this Court in [?CITATION?] ... In case any right conferred on the citizens which is sought to be interfered, such action is subject to Article 14 of the Constitution, and must be reasonable and can be taken only upon lawful and relevant grounds of public interest. Where there is arbitrariness in State action of this type of entering or not entering into contracts, Article 14 springs up and judicial review strikes such an action down. Every action of the State executive authority must be subject to rule of law and must be informed by reason. So, whatever be the activity of the public authority, in such monopoly or semi-monopoly dealings, it should meet the test of Article 14 of the Constitution. If a Governmental action even in the matters of entering or not entering into contracts, fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness, the same would be unreasonable. It appears to us that rule of reason and rule against arbitrariness and discrimination, rules of fair play and natural justice are part of the rule of law applicable in situation or action by State instrumentality in dealing with citizens in a situation like the present one. Even though the rights of the citizens are in the nature of contractual rights, the manner, the method and motive of a decision of entering or not entering into a contract, are subject to judicial review on the touchstone of relevance and reasonableness, fair play, natural justice, equality and non-discrimination in the type of the transactions and nature of the dealing as in the present case.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 20\\. The legal position governing blacklisting of suppliers in USA and UK is no different. In USA instead of using the expression Blacklisting the term debarring is used by the Statutes and the Courts. The Federal Government considers suspension and debarment as a powerful tool for protecting taxpayer resources and maintaining integrity of the processes for federal acquisitions. Comprehensive guidelines are, therefore, issued by the government for protecting public interest from those contractors and recipients who are non-responsible, lack business integrity or engage in dishonest or illegal conduct or are otherwise unable to perform satisfactorily. These guidelines prescribe the following among other grounds for debarment:\n",
      "Paragraph 45: a) Conviction of or civil judgment for -- (1) Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public or private agreement or transaction;\n",
      "Paragraph 46: (2) Violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes, including those proscribing price fixing between competitors, allocation of customers between competitors, and bid rigging;\n",
      "Paragraph 47: (3) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, receiving stolen property, making false claims, or obstruction of justice; or (4) Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects your present responsibility;\n",
      "Paragraph 48: (b) Violation of the terms of a public agreement or transaction so serious as to affect the integrity of an agency program, such as (1) A willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one or more public agreements or transactions;\n",
      "Paragraph 49: (2) A history of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance of one or more public agreements or transactions; or (3) A willful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction;\n",
      "Paragraph 50: (c) xxxx (d) Any other cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it affects your present responsibility.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 21\\. The guidelines also stipulate the factors that may influence the debarring officials decision which include the following:\n",
      "Paragraph 52: a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: d) Whether contractor has been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: (e) Whether and to what extent did the contractor plan, initiate or carry out the wrongdoing.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: (f) Whether the contractor has accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognized the seriousness of the misconduct.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: (g) Whether the contractor has paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: ((h) Whether contractor has cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: (i) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within the contractors organization.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: (j) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: (k) Whether the contractor has taken appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: (l) Whether the contractor fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 22\\. As regards the period for which the order of debarment will remain effective, the guidelines state that the same would depend upon the seriousness of the case leading to such debarment.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 23\\. Similarly in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, there are statutory provisions that make operators ineligible on several grounds including fraud, fraudulent trading or conspiracy to defraud, bribery etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 24\\. Suffice it to say that debarment is recognised and often used as an effective method for disciplining deviant suppliers/contractors who may have committed acts of omission and commission or frauds including misrepresentations, falsification of records and other breaches of the regulations under which such contracts were allotted. What is notable is that the debarment is never permanent and the period of debarment would invariably depend upon the nature of the offence committed by the erring contractor.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 25\\. In the case at hand according to the respondent-BSNL, the appellant had fraudulently withdrawn a huge amount of money which was not due to it in collusion and conspiracy with the officials of the respondent- corporation. Even so permanent debarment from future contracts for all times to come may sound too harsh and heavy a punishment to be considered reasonable especially when (a) the appellant is supplying bulk of its manufactured products to the respondent-BSNL and (b) The excess amount received by it has already been paid back.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: 26\\. The next question then is whether this Court ought to itself determine the time period for which the appellant should be blacklisted or remit the matter back to the authority to do so having regard to the attendant facts and circumstances. A remand back to the competent authority has appealed to us to be a more appropriate option than an order by which we may ourselves determine the period for which the appellant would remain blacklisted. We say so for two precise reasons. Firstly, because blacklisting is in the nature of penalty the quantum whereof is a matter that rests primarily with the authority competent to impose the same. In the realm of service jurisprudence this Court has no doubt cut short the agony of a delinquent employee in exceptional circumstances to prevent delay and further litigation by modifying the quantum of punishment but such considerations do not apply to a company engaged in a lucrative business like supply of optical fibre/HDPE pipes to BSNL. Secondly, because while determining the period for which the blacklisting should be effective the respondent-Corporation may for the sake of objectivity and transparency formulate broad guidelines to be followed in such cases. Different periods of debarment depending upon the gravity of the offences, violations and breaches may be prescribed by such guidelines. While, it may not be possible to exhaustively enumerate all types of offences and acts of misdemeanour, or violations of contractual obligations by a contractor, the respondent-Corporation may do so as far as possible to reduce if not totally eliminate arbitrariness in the exercise of the power vested in it and inspire confidence in the fairness of the order which the competent authority may pass against a defaulting contractor.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 27\\. In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the order passed by the High Court and allow writ petition No.2289 of 2011 filed by the appellant but only to the extent that while the order blacklisting the appellant shall stand affirmed, the period for which such order remains operative shall be determined afresh by the competent authority on the basis of guidelines which the Corporation may formulate for that purpose.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: The needful shall be done by the Corporation and/or the competent authority expeditiously but not later than six months from today. The parties are left to bear their own costs. \n"

      "Paragraph 3: Leave granted.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 2\\. Two questions that arise for consideration in this appeal by special leave are:\n",
      "Paragraph 5: (1) Whether transfer of the 31 employees (appellants) from Crimping Department to Twisting Department by the respondent - employer tantamounts to change in respect of matter specified in item nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule II necessitating notice under Section 42(1) of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946? (2) Whether Letters Patent Appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent was maintainable from the judgment and order dated October 1, 2007 passed by the learned single Judge in Special Civil Application No. 21828/2006? 3\\. We may briefly notice the relevant facts first.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: Garden Silk Mills Ltd. - respondent (hereinafter referred to as, \"employer\") have their mills at Vareli,Taluka Palsane, District Surat. The mills have many departments including Crimping Department and Twisting Department which are located in the same campus. The appellants (hereinafter referred to as, \"employees\"), prior to May 3, 1996, were working as Crimping Operators in the Crimping Department. Initially on May 3, 1996, these employees were informed that they have been transferred to Twisting Department and they must henceforth do their duties in that department. The employees did not join their duties in the Twisting Department and, accordingly, the employer issued written order on May 4, 1996 to these employees individually intimating them that their services have been transferred from Crimping 2 Department to Twisting Department. In the transfer order, it was clarified that there is no change in their service conditions; they will continue to receive same pay scale and all other benefits which they have been getting while working in the Crimping Department.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 4\\. The employees sent request letter under Section 42 (4) of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946 (for short, \"BIR Act\") to the employer requesting them to withdraw the transfer order dated May 4, 1996. The employees also requested the employer to place them at original post in the Crimping Department.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 5\\. On May 9, 1996, the employer sent a reply to the request letter and reiterated that by transfer from Crimping Department to Twisting Department, there has been no change in their service conditions. The employer expressed its inability to withdraw the transfer order. The employer also warned the employees if they did not resume their duty in the Twisting Departing as Twister, an endorsement, \"refused to work\" would be made in the muster roll.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 3\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 6\\. The employees then approached the Labour Court by making an application under Sections 77 and 78 of the BIR Act. According to the employees, they have been working as operators in Crimping Department and they are not conversant to run the twisting machines and by transferring them from Crimping Department to Twisting Department, there is total change in the type of their work. They averred that by transferring them from Crimping Department to Twisting Department, the employer has permanently decreased the strength of the Crimping Department and consequential increase in the Twisting Department. The employees alleged that their transfer by the employer tantamounts to change in respect of matter specified in items nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule II of the BIR Act and, therefore, notice of change under Section 42(1) was required to be given and the prescribed procedure must have been necessarily followed.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 7\\. Yet another application challenging the orders of transfer was made by the Surat Silk Mills Labour Union, representative union, before the Labour Court, Surat.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 4\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 8\\. The employer contested both applications on diverse grounds. Inter alia, it was stated that there is no change in respect of service conditions, pay scale, benefits, designation and type of work as well as continuity of service by transfer of these employees from Crimping Department to the Twisting Department. The employer denied that their action of transferring the employees was covered by item nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule II but, according to them, their action is covered under item 2 of Schedule III of the BIR Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 9\\. It is not necessary to refer to the first round of litigation as the matter was ultimately remanded to the Labour Court for fresh consideration. Before the Labour Court, the parties led documentary evidence but did not lead any oral evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: 10\\. The 1st Labour Court, Surat disposed of both applications by a common order dated September 6, 2001. In its order, 1st Labour Court recorded a finding that the employees had failed to prove that the employer had made change in relation to item nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule II. This is what the 1st Labour Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 5 \"...... it has been held that the applicant has not been able to prove that transfer of workmen has been resulting into strength in crimping department and increase in the strength of twisting department. In such circumstances, application has not been able to prove that opponent has made change in relation to items of Schedule 2 namely item no. 1 and 2. It has been held that opponent has not made any type of illegal change whatsoever and, therefore, it is held that the applicant is not entitled to any of the reliefs as prayed for in OT Application No. 22/96 and OT Application No. 26/96.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: Further, it is also required to be noted that as regards relief no. 2 and 3 in OT Application No. 26/96 sought by the applicant, prayer made is that by ordering for workload to run more than 25 machines and altering wages of the applicants, there has been illegal change effected by the opponent but no such fact has been established by the applicant which has been discussed in this matter in para 11 earlier.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: In all the aforesaid circumstances and for the reasons in this matter as discussed as a whole, the applicant has failed in establishing that the opponent has made illegal change and, therefore, it is held that the opponent has not made any type of illegal change.......\"\n",
      "Paragraph 19: 11\\. Aggrieved by the order of the 1st Labour Court dated September 6, 2001, the employees and the union preferred a joint appeal under Section 84 of BIR Act before the Industrial Court, Surat.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: 12\\. The Industrial Court did not agree with the findings of the 1st Labour Court in its order dated March 9, 2006. It held:\n",
      "Paragraph 21: \"... In the present case, no evidence is produced on record to show whether any strength of workmen with crimping department or twisting department is 6 decided or not; or no agreement if any in this respect has been produced. The appellants could have been able to produce corroborative evidence in respect of the number of permanent workmen by getting produced the muster roll maintained by the opponent in respect of Crimping Department and Twisting Department for the situation prevailing before 4.5.1996 and thereafter. However, the appellants have not produced any oral as well as documentary evidence in respect of number of permanent workmen working in the Crimping Department or Twisting Department and, therefore, the submission of the present appellants that there will be decrease in number of workmen in Crimping Department and increase in the number of workmen in Twisting Department, cannot be proved. The aforesaid finding which is given by the Labour Court is contrary and false to the documentary evidence on record. As I have stated hereinabove, the workmen concerned with both the aforesaid applications have been transferred vide written order from Crimping Department to Twisting Department. There is no dispute between the parties in that respect. If 31 workmen of Crimping Department are to be transferred to Twisting Department, then in one department there will be decease in number of workmen and increase in number of workmen in other department. In that respect, there is no need to make counting as to how many total workmen were there in Crimping or Twisting Department. By way of aforesaid transfer, there is permanent decrease in number of Crimping operators in the Crimping Department. It is said permanent because it is not the say of the company that on transfer of these workmen from Crimping Department, the workmen of other departments will be appointed on these posts by way of transfer. If there was a counter exchange of workmen of Crimping Department and Twisting Department, then the basic defence taken by the management that we have done assignment of work and transfer of works within the establishment i.e. to entrust work in the factory to workmen; to transfer them; would have been proper and this would have fallen in item no. 2 of Schedule-III for which no notice under Section 42(1) is necessary. Thus, the finding given by the Labour Court that the act of management 7 falls under Item No. 2 of Schedule-III is false and erroneous. If the management has said that our act is not included in Item Nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule-II then it is the duty of the Management to show before the Court as to the number of total workmen of the Twisting and Crimping Department. Instead of this, it has been held that the burden is on the appellants, is not proper. ......\n",
      "Paragraph 22: In the case before the Labour Court, the Management has transferred 31 workmen from Crimping Department to twisting Department. In that respect there is no dispute between the parties. Even there is no defence of the respondent that we have transferred 31 workmen from Crimping Department to Twisting Department and from Twisting Department to Crimping Department. If it was the case of only counter exchange, then the case of appellants would not have fallen under Item Nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule - II and the contention raised by the respondent i.e.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: company, that the matter with respect to entrusting the work to workmen and transferring them, falls under Item No. 2 of Schedule-III, could have been accepted. Thus, the Labour Court has believed the authority cited by Shri Chaudhari as correct one. But the Labour Court has held that the appellant union has not been able to prove that there is decrease in number of workmen Crimping Department. When there is no dispute between the parties at the time of transfer of 31 workmen of one department to another Department, there is no need for the Union to prove the decrease in number of workmen. Thus, the finding recorded by the Labour Court is in fact erroneous....\"\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 13\\. The Industrial Court, Surat set aside the order of the 1st Labour Court and directed the employer to withdraw the orders of transfer dated May 4, 1996 and to entrust to the employees, work of the original post.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: 8\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 14\\. The employer challenged the order of the Industrial Court by filing a petition (Special Civil Application) under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution before the High Court of Gujarat. The learned Single Judge dismissed the petition on October 1, 2007 holding thus:\n",
      "Paragraph 27: \"...The Industrial Court has rightly considered the difference between Schedule II and III item Nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule-II and Item No. 2 of Schedule-III and find out the real intention of the employer and come to the conclusion that it is not merely a transfer of 31 employees but, an intention of the employer to reduce the strength from crimping department and increase the strength in twisting department which fall within Item Nos. 1and 2 of Schedule-II of the act which requires notice of change, which is not given and, therefore, it amounts to illegal change.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 28: 15\\. Aggrieved by the order of the learned Single Judge, the employer preferred Letters Patent Appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent before the Division Bench. The Division Bench, after hearing the parties found the appeal meritorious and by its order dated May 14, 2008, allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: The Division Bench also set aside the judgment and order passed by the Industrial Court, Surat and restored the judgment and order dated September 6, 2001 passed by the Labour Court, Surat.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: 9 Re: Question (1) 16\\. Clause (18) of Section 3 defines \"Industrial matter\"\n",
      "Paragraph 31: to mean \"any matter relating to employment, work, wages, hours of work, privileges, rights or duties of employers or employees or the more, terms and conditions of employment.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 17\\. Section 42(1) which is relevant for consideration of this question reads thus:- \"Section 42 - Notice of change (1) Any employer intending to effect any change in respect of an industrial matter specified in Schedule II shall give notice of such intention in the prescribed form to the representative of employees. He shall send a copy of such notice to the Chief Conciliator, the Conciliator for the industry concerned for the local area, the Registrar, the Labour Officer and such other person as may be prescribed. He shall also affix copy of such notice at a conspicuous place on the premises where the employees affected by the change are employed for work and at such other place as may be directed by the Chief Conciliator in any particulars case.\"\n",

      "Paragraph 34: (3) .....\n",
      "Paragraph 35: (4) ....\"\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 18\\. Section 46(4) provides that no employer shall make any change in any industrial matter mentioned in Schedule II before giving notice of change as required by the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 42 and any change made in 10 contravention of the provisions of sub-Section (1), (2) of (3) shall be illegal.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: 19\\. Item 1 of Schedule II reads: \" Reduction intended to be of permanent or semi-permanent character in the number of persons employed or to be employed in any occupation or process or department or departments or in a shift not due to force majeure.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 20\\. Item 2 of Schedule II refers to: \"Permanent or semi- permanent increase in the number of persons employed or to be employed in any occupation or process or department or departments.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 21\\. Item 2 of Schedule III reads: \" Assignment of work and transfer of workers within the establishment.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 22\\. A close look at the Item Nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule II and Item 2 of Schedule III would show that insofar as assignment of work and transfer of workers within the establishment is concerned, the subject is precisely and specifically covered by Item 2 of Schedule III. The expression, `assignment of work and transfer of workers within the establishment' is plain and admits of no ambiguity. If the 11 orders of transfer are of the description mentioned in item 2 of Schedule III, item 2 of Schedule III must come into full play.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: Item nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule II operate altogether in a different field. Basically, Items 1 and 2 of Schedule II deal with reduction in the number of persons employed or to be employed in any occupation or process or department or departments or in a shift or permanent or semi permanent increase in the number of persons employed or to be employed in any occupation or process or department or departments.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: A mere transfer of workers within the establishment would not attract Item Nos. 1 and 2 of Schedule II but would be covered by Item 2 of Schedule III as there is a specific item in this regard. A specific item would exclude the items of general character and, in that view of the matter, in the matters of transfer of workers within the establishment and assignment of work by the employer, the specific Item 2 of Schedule III is attracted.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 23\\. The orders of transfer dated May 4, 1996 apparently make it clear that there is no change in the service conditions of the workers viz. the workers continue to enjoy same pay scales, 12 rights and benefits flowing from service and the type of work also remains the same. The only thing that has been done by the impugned orders of transfer is that these workers have been asked to discharge their duties in the Twisting Department instead of Crimping Department.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 24\\. It is pertinent to notice that the employees did not produce any evidence to establish that there was difference in the work in the Crimping Department and the Twisting Department or that work of operator at the crimping and twisting machines is different. No evidence has been led by the employees about the fixed number of employees in the Crimping Department. In the absence of any evidence by the workers about any fixed number of workers in the Crimping Department and Twisting Department, there is no foundation laid for consideration of the question of reduction in the Crimping Department and increase in number in the Twisting Department by impugned orders of transfer. Obviously, the burden lay on the workers to establish that the number of workers in each of these departments i.e. Crimping Department and Twisting Department has been determined 13 and that due to the action of the employer, there has been decrease or increase in the number of workers in these two departments.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 25\\. We are not persuaded by the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellants that there is a basic difference in the nature of machines in the Crimping and Twisting Departments and that workers are not trained to work at Twisting Machines. If that were so, the workers ought to have led evidence in that regard which they never did.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 26\\. The Division Bench of the High Court in this regard considered the matter thus:\n",
      "Paragraph 47: \"...We do appreciate that transfer of the employees from one department to another, in absence of corresponding transfer, would necessarily result into reduction in manpower in one department and corresponding increase in the manpower in the other department. But, we are unable to agree that Item 1 of the Schedule II to the Act is intended to cover the cases like the one before us. Had that been the legislative intent the \"assignment of work and the transfer of workers within the establishment\" would not have been included in Schedule III to the act. If the reasoning of the Industrial court were accepted, the above referred Item 2 in Schedule III to the Act would become nugatory. The cardinal principle of interpretation of statutes requires that the interpretation which would render a part of the legislation nugatory or otiose should be avoided.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: What is required is harmonization or conciliation amongst the two seemingly contradictory or repugnant provisions in an enactment. As the matter \"assignment of work and transfer of workers within the 14 establishment\" has been specifically included in Schedule III to the Act, it cannot be artificially brought under Item 1 of Schedule II by reference to the presumable consequences of such transfer or assignment of work.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 49: 27\\. We agree with the view of the High Court and for the reasons already indicated above, we answer question (1) in the negative.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: Re.: Question (2) 28\\. In the Case of Umaji Kesho Meshram vs.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: Radhikabai,1, this Court had an occasion to consider the question whether any appeal lies under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court before the Division Bench of two Judges of the High Court from the judgment and order of the learned single Judge of the High Court in petition filed under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution. The Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 52: \"100\\. According to the Full Bench even were clause 15 to apply, an appeal would be barred by the express words of clause 15 because the nature of the jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 is the same inasmuch as it consists of granting the same relief, namely, scrutiny of records and control of subordinate courts and tribunals and, therefore, the exercise of jurisdiction under these articles would be covered by the expression \"revisional jurisdiction\" and \"power of superintendence\". We are afraid, the Full Bench has misunderstood the scope and effect of the powers 1 1986 (Supp) SCC 401 15 conferred by these articles. These two articles stand on an entirely different footing. As made abundantly clear in the earlier part of this judgment, their source and origin are different and the models upon which they are patterned are also different. Under Article 226 the High Courts have power to issue directions, orders and writs to any person or authority including any Government. Under Article 227 every High Court has power of superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territory in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction. The power to issue writs is not the same as the power of superintendence. By no stretch of imagination can a writ in the nature of habeas corpus or mandamus or quo warranto or prohibition or certiorari be equated with the power of superintendence. These are writs which are directed against persons, authorities and the State. The power of superintendence conferred upon every High Court by Article 227 is a supervisory jurisdiction intended to ensure that subordinate courts and tribunals act within the limits of their authority and according to law (see [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]. The orders, directions and writs under Article 226 are not intended for this purpose and the power of superintendence conferred upon the High Courts by Article 227 is in addition to that conferred upon the High Courts by Article 226. Though at the first blush it may seem that a writ of certiorari or a writ of prohibition partakes of the nature of superintendence inasmuch as at times the end result is the same, the nature of the power to issue these writs is different from the supervisory or superintending power under Article 227. The powers conferred by Articles 226 and 227 are separate and distinct and operate in different fields. The fact that the same result can at times be achieved by two different processes does not mean that these two processes are the same.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 101\\. Under Article 226 an order, direction or writ is to issue to a person, authority or the State. In a proceeding under that article the person, authority or State against whom the direction, order or writ is sought is a necessary party. Under Article 227, however, what comes up before the High Court is the 16 order or judgment of a subordinate court or tribunal for the purpose of ascertaining whether in giving such judgment or order that subordinate court or tribunal has acted within its authority and according to law.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: Prior to the commencement of the Constitution, the Chartered High Courts as also the Judicial Committee had held that the power to issue prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts was an exercise of original jurisdiction (see [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and[?CITATION?]). In the last mentioned case which dealt with the nature of a writ of quo warranto, the Judicial Committee held:\n",
      "Paragraph 55: \"In Their Lordships' opinion any original civil jurisdiction possessed by the High Court and not in express terms conferred by the Letters Patent or later enactments falls within the description of ordinary original civil jurisdiction.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 56: By Article 226 the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts prior to the commencement of the Constitution has been made wider and more extensive and conferred upon every High Court. The nature of the exercise of the power under Article 226, however, remains the same as in the case of the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts. A series of decisions of this Court has firmly established that a proceeding under Article 226 is an original proceeding and when it concerns civil rights, it is an original civil proceeding (see, for instance, [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 57: 102\\. Consequently, where a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution is according to the Rules of a particular High Court heard by a Single Judge, an intra-court appeal will lie from that judgment if such a right of appeal is provided in the Charter of that High Court, whether such Charter be Letters Patent or a statute. Clause 15 of the Letters 17 Patent of the Bombay High Court gives in such a case a right of intra-court appeal and, therefore, the decision of a Single Judge of that High Court given in a petition under Article 226 would be appealable to a Division Bench of that High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: 107\\. Petitions are at times filed both under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. The case of [?CITATION?] before this Court was of such a type. Rule 18 provides that where such petitions are filed against orders of the Tribunals or authorities specified in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side Rules or against decrees or orders of courts specified in that rule, they shall be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge. The question is whether an appeal would lie from the decision of the Single Judge in such a case. In our opinion, where the facts justify a party in filing an application either under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution, and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles, in fairness and justice to such party and in order not to deprive him of the valuable right of appeal the court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226, and if in deciding the matter, in the final order the court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227, this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to be appealed against is under Article 226. Such was the view taken by the Allahabad High Court in [?CITATION?] and by the Punjab High Court in [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] and we are in agreement with it.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 29\\. In the case of [?CITATION?], this Court held that for determining the question of maintainability of an appeal against the Judgement of the single Judge in a writ 2 1993 (Suppl.) 1 SCC 9 18 petition where both Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution have been mentioned, the Division Bench has to find out whether in substance the judgment has been passed by the learned single Judge in exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. The Court held thus:\n",
      "Paragraph 60: \"2\\. The only question involved in this matter is as to whether the High Court was right in holding that a Letters Patent Appeal will not lie against the judgment delivered by a learned Single Judge in a petition which was filed under both the Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. Having gone through the judgment of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench and having heard learned counsel for the parties, in our opinion, the question about the scope of Letters Patent Appeal under clause 15 has been clearly laid down by this Court in a judgment reported in [?CITATION?] \"Petitions are at times filed both under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. The case of [?CITATION?] before this Court was of such a type. Rule 18 provides that where such petitions are filed against orders of the tribunals or authorities specified in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side Rules or against decrees or orders of courts specified in that rule, they shall be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge. The question is whether an appeal would lie from the decision of the Single Judge in such a case.

Such was the view taken by the Allahabad High Court in [?CITATION?] and by the Punjab High Court in [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] and we are in agreement with it.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 3\\. It is clear that so far as the present case was concerned the relief granted by the learned Single Judge clearly indicate that he was exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 and not under Article 227 of the Constitution and in this view of the matter and in the light of what has been laid down by this Hon'ble Court in the judgment referred to above a Letters Patent Appeal under clause 15 would be maintainable before the Division Bench of the High Court. The appeal is, therefore, allowed and the judgment passed by the learned Division Bench is set aside. The matter is sent back to the High Court and it is expected that the Division Bench will hear the appeal on merits and dispose it of in accordance with law expeditiously preferably within four months from today.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 62: 30\\. In Sushilabai Laxminarayan Mudliyar and others vs.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: Nihalchand Waghajibhai Shah and Others3, the Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 64: \"4.The Full Bench of the Bombay High Court wrongly understood the above Umaji Kesho Meshram case. In Umaji case it was clearly held that where the facts justify a party in filing an application either under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles in fairness of justice to party and in order not to deprive him of valuable right of appeal the Court ought to treat the application as being made under 3 1993 Suppl. (1) SCC 11 20 Article 226, and if in deciding the matter, in the final order the Court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227, this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to be appealed against is under Article 226\\. Rule 18 of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules read with clause 15 of the Letters Patent provides for appeal to the Division Bench of the High Court from a judgment of the learned Single Judge passed on a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. In the present case the Division Bench was clearly wrong in holding that the appeal was not maintainable against the order of the learned Single Judge. In these circumstances we set aside the impugned order of the Division Bench and direct that the Letters Patent Appeal filed against the judgment of the learned Single Judge would now be heard and decided on merits.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 31\\. The issue concerning maintainability of Letters Patent Appeal from an order of single Judge in the writ petition filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, again came up for consideration before this Court in the case of [?CITATION?] This Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 66: \"13\\. The learned Single Judge of the High Court, in our opinion, committed an error in interfering with the findings of fact arrived at by the Board of Revenue.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: The Division Bench of the High Court also wrongly dismissed the LPA without noticing that an appeal would be maintainable if the writ petition was filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India as was held by this Court in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 68: 32\\. The discussion on the subject would be incomplete without reference to two recent decisions of this Court viz., (i) [?CITATION?], and (ii) [?CITATION?]. In the case of Visan Kumar Shiv Charan Lal, this Court referred to earlier decisions in the case of [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?], and held:\n",
      "Paragraph 69: \"8\\. ......\"Even when in the cause title of an application both Article 226 and Article 227 of the Constitution have been mentioned, the learned single Judge is at liberty to decide, according to facts of each particular case, whether the said application ought to be dealt with only under Article 226 of the Constitution. For determining the question of maintainability of an appeal against such a judgment of the Single Judge the Division bench has to find out whether in substance the judgment has been passed by the learned Single Judge in exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. In the event in passing his judgment on an application which had mentioned in its cause title both Articles 226 and 227, the Single Judge has in fact invoked only his supervisory powers under Article 227, the appeal under clause 15 would not lie. The clause 15 of the Letters Patent expressly bars appeals against orders of Single Judges passed under revisional or supervisory powers. Even when the learned Single Judge's order has been passed under both the articles, for deciding the maintainability against such an order what would be relevant is the principal or main relief granted by the judgment passed by 5 [?CITATION?] learned Single Judge and not the ancillary directions given by him. The expression `ancillary' means, in the context, incidental or consequential to the main part of the order.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 70: 33\\. In Visan Kumar Shiv Charan Lal, this Court further held that the determining factor is the real nature of principal order passed by the Single Judge which is appealed against and neither mentioning in the cause title of the application of both the Articles nor granting of ancillary order thereupon by the Single Judge would be relevant and in each case the Division Bench must consider the substance of the Judgment under appeal to ascertain whether the Single Judge has mainly or principally exercised his jurisdiction under Article 226 or Article 227 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 34\\. In Ramesh Chandra Sankla, this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 72: \"32\\. In our judgment, the learned Counsel for the appellant is right in submitting that nomenclature of the proceeding or reference to a particular Article of the Constitution is not final or conclusive. He is also right in submitting that an observation by a Single Judge as to how he had dealt with the matter is also not decisive. If it were so, a petition strictly falling under Article 226 simpliciter can be disposed of by a Single Judge observing that he is exercising power of superintendence under Article 227of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: Can such statement by a Single Judge take away from the party aggrieved a right of appeal against the judgment if otherwise the petition is under Article 226 of the Constitution and subject to an intra 23 court/Letters Patent Appeal? The reply unquestionably is in the negative.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 74: 35\\. If the judgment under appeal falls squarely within four corners of Article 227, it goes without saying that intra court appeal from such judgment would not be maintainable .\n",
      "Paragraph 75: On the other hand, if the petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court for issuance of certain writ under Article 226, although Article 227 is also mentioned, and principally the judgment appealed against falls under Article 226, the appeal would be maintainable. What is important to be ascertained is the true nature of order passed by the Single Judge and not what provision he mentions while exercising such powers. We agree with the view of this Court in Ramesh Chandra Sankla that a statement by learned Single Judge that he has exercised power under Article 227, cannot take away right of appeal against such judgment if power is otherwise found to have been exercised under Article 226. The vital factor for determination of maintainability of intra court appeal is the nature of jurisdiction invoked by the party and the true nature of principal order passed by the Single Judge.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 24\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 36\\. Insofar as the present case is concerned, in the cause title of the writ petition (Special Civil Application), Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution have been mentioned.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: A careful reading of the writ petition shows that writ petition is not confined to supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. The employer has invoked jurisdiction of the High Court by praying for a writ of certiorari. The prayer clause in the writ petition reads, \"In view of the aforesaid premises your Lordships may be pleased to issue a writ of certiorari or any other appropriate order......\" . The judgment of the Single Judge is, thus, traceable to Article 226. The statement made by the Single Judge in his order that no case for interference is made out under Article 227 of the Constitution is not decisive. Moreover, the Division Bench in its order observed, \"though long drawn arguments were advanced on the question of maintainability of this Appeal, there rally was not a serious contest on the question of maintainability of the Appeal.\" For all these reasons, we hold that Letters Patent Appeal was maintainable from the order dated October 1, 2007 passed by the learned Single Judge. We answer question (2) in affirmative.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: 25 37 By way of foot-note, we may observe that during the course of hearing of the appeal, we were informed by the Senior Counsel for the employer that dispute has been resolved amicably with twelve employees. We gave an opportunity to the remaining employees to settle the dispute with the employer as has been done by twelve employees, and although employer expressed their willingness, but the remaining employees found the offer of the employer unacceptable.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 38\\. In the result, appeal fails and is dismissed with no order as to costs.\n",

      "Paragraph 3: Dr. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 1\\. Leave granted.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 2\\. This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 1.8.2008 passed by the High Court of Calcutta in FMA No.782 of 2007; MAT No.4487 of 2005; and CAN No.4852 of 2006 by which the Division Bench has allowed the appeal of the respondent against the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge dated 16.9.2005 passed in Writ Petition No.2539(W) of 2005 by which the learned 1 Single Judge had rejected the claim of the respondent for parity in pay and issuance of direction to upgrade the post held by him.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 3\\. Facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that the appellant No.2 issued an advertisement in \"The Statesman\"\n",
      "Paragraph 7: newspaper dated 22.9.1993 inviting applications for the post of Speech Therapist/Audiologist at the Durgapur Steel Plant in S-6 grade in Medical and Health Services. The respondent applied in response to the said advertisement. An interview was held on 17.6.1996 and the respondent's name found place at serial no.4 in the merit list. As none of the first three candidates joined, the appointment was offered to the respondent vide letter dated 17.6.1996. The respondent joined the said post without any protest. After serving for a few years, respondent started claiming parity with one Shri B.V. Prabhakar, employed at Rourkela Steel Plant, a different unit of the same company who was holding the post of E-1 grade in executive cadre though designated as Speech Therapist/Audiologist. Respondent made representation dated 1.9.2004 not claiming parity in pay but to change the cadre and upgrade his post, accord relaxation in eligibility and give him the pay-scale of the post of E-1 grade from the date of 2 his joining the service. The said representation stood rejected vide order dated 12/14.10.2004 by the Authorities, observing that upgradation of his post to executive cadre was not permissible under the policy of the company, and as the respondent was working in non- executive cadre, he could not claim parity with an employee in another unit of the company on a post of executive cadre.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 4\\. Being aggrieved, the respondent preferred the writ petition before the High Court claiming the same relief, however, the learned Single Judge dismissed the same vide judgment and order dated 16.9.2005. The respondent challenged the said judgment by filing an intra court appeal. The said appeal has been allowed, issuing direction to the present appellants to grant the pay-scale to the respondent as was being paid to Shri B.V. Prabhakar at the Rourkela Steel Plant in the executive cadre and that too from the date of his initial appointment. The arrears also were to be paid within six weeks.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: Hence, this appeal.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 5\\. Shri Rajiv Dhawan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants has submitted that the said B.V. Prabhakar had been appointed vide order dated 20.4.1987 in Rourkela Steel Plant in 3 executive cadre in E-1 grade taking into account his experience in service in the Bokaro Steel Plant, another unit of the company. There are different set of rules governing the services of the employees of all different plants/units of the company and all the employees are not governed by the Central Rules. The respondent has not been appointed in the centralised service nor is his post transferable. The mode of appointment and selection of employees in each unit is different and made independently. The respondent had applied in pursuance of an advertisement dated 22.9.1993 for a non-executive post along with eight other candidates. Respondent's name was at serial no.4 in the merit list/panel. The name of Shri Sourav Mukhopadhyay, serving in Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as BHEL) appeared at serial no.1 in the panel, however as he was getting higher pay in BHEL than the post in question, he asked for pay protection. His demand was not acceptable to the appellants, thus, he declined the offer. The post was offered to Shri Mithlesh Kumar, the next candidate in the panel, but he did not turn up to join. The third candidate in panel claimed for upgrading the post which was not acceptable to the company for the reason that the post had been advertised with certain grade and pay-scale and it was not 4 possible for the unit to upgrade the same. On refusal to join by the third candidate, the post was offered to the respondent and he accepted and joined the post without protest in S-6 grade on 17.6.1996 on the terms and conditions incorporated in his appointment letter.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: The post to which the respondent claimed parity is not equivalent to the post held by him and therefore, the question of pay parity could not arise. The relief sought by the respondent had been of upgradation of post, granting relaxation of eligibility with retrospective effect. Such a relief could not be granted to him. Each plant/unit has to make the recruitment as per the local needs and as per the requirements of the plant. Thus, all the units do not have the same service conditions. A post may be in executive cadre in one unit and may be in non-executive cadre in another unit. Unequals cannot be treated equals. Thus, there was no justification for the Division Bench to allow the appeal filed by the respondent. Pay parity claimed by the respondent could not be given to him as he was holding a non- executive post, while Shri B.V. Prabhakar was holding the post in executive cadre in another unit of the same company. Hence, the appeal deserves to be allowed.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 5\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 6\\. Per contra, Shri S.K. Keshote, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent has vehemently opposed the appeal contending that parity in pay is a fundamental right of an employee. Both the posts carry the same nature of work and responsibilities. There is no difference in both the posts qualitatively. It is immaterial whether Shri B.V. Prabhakar was holding the post in executive cadre. The relief has been granted by the Division Bench of the High Court after considering all relevant factors and judgments of this Court. The impugned judgment and order does not require any interference and thus, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 7\\. We have considered the rival submissions made by both learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: 8\\. Undoubtedly, several posts were advertised on 22.9.1993 by the appellant No.2 to fill up the vacancies in Durgapur Steel Plant including the post of Speech Therapist/Audiologist in S-6 grade and post of Doctor in grade E-1, Executive in Medical and Health Services. The respondent applied for the post in grade S-6 as he was not eligible for the post of grade E-1 wanting the qualification of a Doctor. Respondent in his representation made to the Authorities, 6 claimed the change of cadre and upgradation of his post. The last part of his representation dated 1.9.2004 reads as under:- \"I may kindly be placed/selected in Executive cadre waiving some criteria applicable to eligible candidate for Executive posts, if nothing can be done to place me initially from the date of my joining in DSP in Executive cadre.\" (Emphasis added) Thus, it is evident from the aforesaid representation that the respondent requested the employer to waive the eligibility criteria and upgrade his post to the executive cadre with retrospective effect, i.e., from the date of his initial joining.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: The said representation stood rejected vide order dated 12/14.10.2004 with observation that non-executive post could not be upgraded to the executive cadre as per the policy of the company.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: More so, there was no enabling provision for grant of relaxation to the eligibility criteria.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: 9\\. The respondent approached the High Court by filing the writ petition, inter alia, claiming the following reliefs:- \"(a) A writ of and/or in the nature of Mandamus commanding the respondents, their men, agents and/or assigns to rescind and/or cancel the memos bearing no.PL- 1/1(101)/6/07/Theraphy/004/2217 dated 1.10.2004, and DMHS/Misc/reply/October dated 12/14.10.2004, issued by 7 the Manager (Personnel/recruitment), SAIL, DSP and the Director (M & HS), Durgapur Steel Plant respectively, forthwith;\n",
      "Paragraph 19: (b) A writ of and/or in the nature of Mandamus commanding the respondents, each one of them, their servants, agents and/or assigns to fix up the scale of pay of the petitioner commensurate to the post of E-1 as it is prevailing in other units of SAIL, forthwith;\n",

      "Paragraph 24: ....................................................................\"\n",
      "Paragraph 25: 10\\. Appellants contested the case pointing out that it was not 8 permissible under the statutory rules/policy of the company to meet the demand of the respondent-employee. Had it been so, the appointment could have been offered to Shri Sourav Mukhopadhyay who claimed protection of pay which he was getting in BHEL, or to accede to the request made by other panellists to upgrade the post and in that manner the company could have got the service of a better candidate than the respondent. The writ petition was dismissed vide judgment and order dated 16.9.2005 observing that two unequals cannot be treated equals. Thus, the respondent was not dealt with any discrimination as there was no post in Durgapur Steel Plant of Speech Therapist/Audiologist in executive cadre. The relief sought could not be granted to him and there was no reason to accept the writ petition.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: The Division Bench failed to appreciate what the relief claimed by the respondent was and further that two unequals cannot be treated equals. The Division Bench was swayed by an impression that it was not permissible for the employer-Company to have different pay- scales in two different units existing at different locations, though such a course is always permissible for the management.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 11\\. We have thoroughly examined the Personnel Manual prepared by the Steel Authority of India Ltd. in 1992. It prescribes different 9 posts in different grades. E-1 grade posts include Management Trainees, Junior Managers and Medical Officers. Clause 5.3.1 clearly provides that centralised services are limited for few posts only which are Executive posts in grade E-6 and above; Management Trainees (Technical) in E-1 grade; and Junior Manager (F & A) in grade E-1 etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: Clause 5.3.2 reads as under:- \"Direct recruitment to all other posts, executive as well as non-executive, will be done at the respective Plant/Unit level, unless decided otherwise by the competent authority.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 29: Clause 16.2 provides that all appointments offered shall be made by respective Unit/Plant. Thus, it is evident that the services of the respondent were governed by rules governing the Unit/Plant i.e.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: Durgapur Steel Plant. It was not centralised service and every unit was to be treated as a separate and independent in these regards though belonging to the same company. In peculiar circumstances, it may be open to the authority to place a particular post in executive cadre and such a post may be required to be filled up by an experienced/qualified person. Another unit may not require such a higher post, considering the local needs and requirements. In such a 1 fact-situation, it is neither desirable nor permissible to allow the claim of parity by the respondent holding a post in non-executive cadre to a post in executive cadre. Nor it is permissible for the court to have a judicial review of the reasons for which the said post has been kept in executive cadre in another unit. Such a requirement may be present in the Unit at Rourkela Steel Plant. However, it cannot be doubted that the said Shri B.V. Prabhakar had been appointed in 1987 about two decades prior to the respondent. Parity in pay with a person of such seniority may not be justified.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: 12\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court considered the provisions of Articles 39 (d), 14 and 16 of the Constitution and held that the principle of `equal pay for equal work' is not always easy to apply. There are inherent difficulties in comparing and evaluating the work done by different persons in different organisations, or even in the same organisation. There may be differences in educational or technical qualifications, which may have a bearing on the skills which the holders bring to their job although the designation of the job may be the same. There may also be other considerations which have relevance to efficiency in service, which may justify differences in pay scales on the basis of criteria 1 such as experience and seniority, or a need to prevent stagnation in the cadre, so that good performances can be elicited from persons who have reached the top of the pay scale. There may be various other similar considerations which may have a bearing on efficient performance in a job.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 13\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court held as under:- \"To claim a relief on the basis of equality, it is for the claimants to substantiate a clear-cut basis of equivalence and a resultant hostile discrimina- tion before becoming eligible to claim rights on a par with other group vis-a-vis an alleged discrim- ination........ Equal pay for equal work\" is a concept which requires for its applicability com- plete and wholesome identity between a group of employees claiming identical pay scales and the other group of employees who have already earned such pay scales. The problem about equal pay cannot always be translated into a mathemat- ical formula.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 14\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court considered a similar issue and ob- served that while determining the issue of parity in pay, large number of considerations and various dimensions of the job are required to be taken up by the courts. The accuracy required by the job and the dex- 1 terity it entails may differ from job to job. It cannot be evaluated by the mere averments in the self - serving affidavits or counter affidavits of the parties. It must be left to be evaluated and determined by ex- pert body. The Court further held as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 34: \"The discrimination complained of must be within the same establishment owned by the same management. A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with differ- ent management, or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master. Unless it is shown that there is a discrimination amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment, the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" cannot be enforced....\"(Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 15\\. In M[?CITATION?], this Court dealt with an issue of pay parity between Speech Therapists and Audiologists and held that merely because Speech Therapists perform similar duties and functions in other institutions, are paid higher pay-scales is no good ground to accept the petitioner's claim for equal pay. There may be difference in educational qualifications, quality and volume of work required to be performed by the hearing therapists in other institu- tions. The person claiming parity must sufficiently produce material before the Court to adjudicate upon such a complicated issue of factu- 1 al determination. More so, if the employer is not the same, the prin- ciple of equal pay for equal work would not be applicable.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 16\\. It is the duty of an employee seeking parity of pay under Article 39(d) of the Constitution of India to prove and establish that he had been discriminated against, as the question of parity has to be decided on consideration of various facts and statutory rules etc. The doctrine of `equal pay for equal work' as enshrined under Article 39 (d) of the Constitution read with Article 14 thereof, cannot be applied in a vacu- um. The constitutional scheme postulates equal pay for equal work for those who are equally placed in all respects. The Court must consider the factors like the source and mode of recruitment/appointment, the qualifications, the nature of work, the value thereof, responsibilities, reliability, experience, confidentiality, functional need, etc. In other words, the equality clause can be invoked in the matter of pay scales only when there is wholesome/wholesale identity between the holders of two posts. The burden of establishing right and parity in employment is only on person claiming such right. (Vide [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; and [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 37: 17\\. This Court while deciding a similar issue in [?CITATION?], held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 38: \"The evaluation of duties and responsibilities of different posts and determination of the pay scales applicable to such posts and determination of parity in duties and responsibilities are complex executive functions, to be carried out by expert bodies. Granting parity in pay scale depends upon comparative job evaluation and equation of posts.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: The principle `equal pay for equal work' is not a fundamental right but a constitutional goal. It is dependent on various factors such as educational qualifications, nature of the jobs, duties to be performed, responsibilities to be discharged, experience, method of recruitment, etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: Comparison merely based on designation of posts is misconceived. Courts should approach such matters with restraint and interfere only if they are satisfied that the decision of the Government is patently irrational, unjust and prejudicial to any particular section of employees.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 1 The burden to prove disparity is on the employees claiming parity.\" (emphasis added) (See also [?CITATION?])\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 18\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court accepted the factors laid down by the Committee of Chief Sec- retaries which was constituted for settling the disputes regarding equa- tion of posts arising out of the [States Reorganisation Act, 1956], wherein the following four factors had been held to be determinative of the issue of equivalence of posts:- 1\\. The nature and duties of a post;\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 2\\. The responsibilities and powers exercised by the officer holding a post, the extent of territorial or other charge held or responsibilities discharged;\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 3\\. The minimum qualifications, if any, prescribed for recruitment to the post; and 4.The salary of the post.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 19\\. In [?CITATION?]; and [?CITATION?], a similar view has been reiterated observing that equal status and nature 1 and responsibilities of the duties attached to the two posts have to be taken into consideration for equivalence of the post.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 20\\. Similar view has been reiterated in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; and [?CITATION?], wherein this Court following the earlier judgment in P.K. Roy (Supra) held that the salary of the post alone may not be a determining factor, the other three criterion should also be fulfilled.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: 21\\. In [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; and [?CITATION?], this Court held that whether the determination of two posts are equal or not, is a job of the Expert Committee and the court should not interfere with it unless the decision of the Committee is found to be unreasonable or arbitrary or made on extraneous con- siderations. More so, it is an executive function to fix the service con- ditions etc. and lies within the exclusive domain of the rule making authority.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 1 (See also [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 49: 22\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 50: \"In our opinion fixing pay scales by courts by applying the principle of equal pay for equal work upsets the high constitutional principle of separa- tion of powers between the three organs of the State. Realising this, this Court has in recent years avoided applying the principle of equal pay for equal work, unless there is complete and whole- sale identity between the two groups........\"\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 23\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 52: \"......it is not open to the court to consider whether the equation of posts made by the Central Government is right or wrong. This was a matter exclusively within the province of the Central Gov- ernment. Perhaps the only question the court can enquire into is whether the four principles cited above had been properly taken into account. This is the narrow and limited field within which the su- pervisory jurisdiction of the court can operate\".\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 24\\. It is a settled legal proposition that it is not always impermissible to provide two different pay-scales in the same cadre on the basis of selection based on merit with due regard to experience 1 and seniority. (Vide J.P. Chaurasia (Supra) and Meva Ram Kanojia (Supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 54: 25\\. \"Non-uniformities would not in all events violate Article 14.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 55: Thus, a mere difference does not always amount to discrimination.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: (Vide [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]; and Official Liquidator (Supra)).\n",
      "Paragraph 57: 26\\. In view of the above, the law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that parity of pay can be claimed by invoking the provisions of Articles 14 and 39(d) of the Constitution of India by establishing that the eligibility, mode of selection/recruitment, nature and quality of work and duties and effort, reliability, confidentiality, dexterity, functional need and responsibilities and status of both the posts are identical. The functions may be the same but the skills and responsibilities may be really and substantially different. The other post may not require any higher qualification, seniority or other like factors. Granting parity in pay scales depends upon the comparative evaluation of job and equation of posts. The person claiming parity, must plead necessary averments and prove that all things are equal 1 between the concerned posts. Such a complex issue cannot be adju- dicated by evaluating the affidavits filed by the parties. The onus to establish the discrimination by the employer lies on the person claim- ing the parity of pay. The expert committee has to decide such issues, as the fixation of pay scales etc. falls within the exclusive domain of the executive. So long as the value judgment of those who are responsible for administration i.e. service conditions etc., is found to be bonafide, reasonable, and on intelligible criteria which has a rational nexus of objective of differentiation, such differentiation will not amount to discrimination. It is not prohibited in law to have two grades of posts in the same cadre. Thus, the nomenclature of a post may not be the sole determinative factor. The courts in exercise of their limited power of judicial review can only examine whether the decision of the State authorities is rational and just or prejudicial to a particular set of employees. The court has to keep in mind that a mere difference in service conditions does not amount to discrimination.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: Unless there is complete and wholesale/wholesome identity between the two posts they should not be treated as equivalent and the Court should avoid applying the principle of equal pay for equal work.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 2\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 27\\. The present case requires to be examined in view of the afore- said settled legal propositions. Undoubtedly, the respondent had ap- plied in response to an advertisement for the post of Grade S-6 and not for Grade E-1 as he did not possess the requisite qualifications for the post in the said Grade. The name of the respondent had appeared at serial No. 4 in the merit list and he was offered appointment only for the reason that the candidates whose names appeared at serial Nos.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 1 and 3 asked for pay protection/up-gradation of the post, and it was not acceptable to the employer. The candidate whose name appeared at serial No.2 in the merit list, did not join though was offered the ap- pointment. The respondent accepted the appointment in Grade S-6 on the terms and conditions incorporated in his appointment letter without any protest. The relief sought by the respondent is the same, which had, in fact been asked by two candidates in the merit list, above the respondent. If such a demand was acceptable to the appel- lants they could have gotten a more meritorious candidate than re- spondent. Grant of the relief sought by the respondent is violative of equality clause contained in Article 14 of the Constitution of India qua other candidates in the panel above the respondent who did not join for not granting the same relief though it had been sought at least 2 by two of them at the initial state of recruitment. By the impugned or- der, the respondent has not been granted the post in Grade E-1 but salary equivalent to that of Shri B.V. Prabhakar has been granted to the Respondent. The order itself is mutually inconsistent and contra- dictory. The representation of the respondent had been for waiving the criteria meaning thereby that the respondent sought a relaxation in the eligibility criteria for the post in Grade E-1. It is evident from the rep- resentation itself that the respondent never possessed the eligibility for the post of Grade E-1. The Law does not prohibit an employer to have different grade of posts in two different units owned by him.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: Every unit is an independent entity for the purpose of making recruit- ment of most of its employees. The respondent had not been appoin- ted in centralised services of the company. Shri B.V. Prabhakar, had been appointed in E-1 Grade, in the Rourkela unit, considering his past services in the Bokaro Steel Plant, another unit of the company, for about two decades prior to the recruitment of the respondent. As every unit may make appointments taking into consideration the local needs and requirement, such parity claimed by the respondent cannot be held to be tenable. The reliefs sought by the respondent for up- gradation of the post and waiving the eligibility criteria had rightly 2 been refused by the appellants and by the learned Single Judge. In such a fact-situation, there was no justification for the Division Bench to allow the writ petition, granting the benefit from the date of initial appointment of the respondent. The respondent has not produced any tangible material to substantiate his claim, thus, he could not dis- charge the onus of proof to establish that he had made some justifiable claim. The respondent miserably failed to make out a case for pay parity to the post of E-1 Grade in executive cadre. The appeal, thus, deserves to be allowed.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: 28\\. Before parting with the case, it may be pertinent to state that al- though a Plant/Unit of the appellant-company is competent to make appointment in the executive and non-executive cadres in the said plant/unit, however, it has no authority to determine the grade or the pay scale of a post or determine and sanction the number of posts since the same relates to the recruitment policy of the appellant-com- pany. This would be evident from the perusal of the Recruitment Plan of the appellant-company laid down at Clause 7.1 of the Personnel Manual which reads:\n",
      "Paragraph 64: \"The Recruitment Plan will form part of the annu- al Human Resource Plan of the Company. Among 2 other things, the Human Resource Plan will clearly state the skill/grade wise requirement of man power in the Company i.e., the Plants/Units, and the subsidiaries separately. Any deviation from the approved plan/mix will be subject to the prior approval of Chairman/Board.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 65: In view of the above, the competent authority in the corporate office of the appellant-company is directed to consider the issue ex- peditiously relating to anomaly raised by the respondent herein for fu- ture recruitments.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: Present appeal impugnes the judgment and order dated 28.05.2012 passed by the High Court of Delhi, thereby dismissing the writ petition which was filed by the appellant. It so happened that the appellant had entered into two contracts dated 20.02.1995 with the Union of India, through Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) in the year 1992 relating to exploration of certain oil fields which the Union of India had selected in Gujarat and other States. These contracts were on production sharing basis for Dholka and Wavel Oil Fields respectively. It started the production after entering into the contract and filed its income tax return on the income generated from the aforesaid production. In the returns, the appellant claimed benefit of Section 42 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). Section 42 is a special provision for deductions in the case of business for prospecting, etc. for mineral oil. It provides for certain additional allowances as are specified in the agreement, details thereof would be taken note of hereinafter. We may, however, point out here itself that such allowances, as stipulated in the Section, are to be specifically mentioned in the agreement as well, which is entered into with the Central Government and it is also necessary that such an agreement has been laid on the Table of each House of Parliament.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: The Income Tax Authorities extended the benefit of granting deductions under the aforesaid provisions from the year 2001-02 (assessment years onwards) when the appellant commenced commercial production in the aforesaid two oil fields. However, while making assessment for the Assessment Year 2005-06, the Assessing Officer observed that there were no such provisions made in the Agreements which were signed between the Central Government and the appellant and in the absence of such stipulation in the agreement, the appellant was not entitled to the benefit of deductions under Section 42 of the Act. Realising that the Agreements did not contain such a provision, the appellant wrote to the MoPNG stating that though there was such an arrangement agreed to as per the understanding between the two parties, non-inclusion thereof was an inadvertent omission in the Contracts that were signed. The MoPNG wrote to Ministry of Finance (MoF) accepting the aforesaid omissions and requested the MoF to give clarification in this behalf. As no clarification came from the MoF, the Assessing Officer disallowed the claim for deduction under Section 42(1)(b) and 42(1)(c) of the Act. At this stage, the appellant preferred writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in the High Court of Delhi with the following prayers.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Therefore it is most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue:- (I) A writ, direction or order declaring that the petitioner is entitled, in respect of the two Production Sharing Contracts dated 20.02.1995 executed with the petitioner for the Dholka and Wavel Oil Fields in Gujarat, to the benefit of the said deductions (set forth in Article 16 of the MPSC and reproduced in Annexure P1) under Section 42 of the Income- Tax Act, 1961, from the date of these Production Sharing Contracts, as has been stated and declared by the respondent no. 1 (i.e., the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas) in several of its communications; and that the petitioner is entitled to the said Deductions on the same footing as all other contractors who have executed PSCs with the Union of India;\n",
      "Paragraph 4: (ii) A writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari quashing the impugned order dated 31.12.2007 issued by Respondent No. 1; the notice dated 28.03.2008 for re-opening of the petitioner's income-tax assessments for the Assessment Years 2001-2002; 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 and the notice dated 01.05.2008 for re-opening the assessment for the Assessment Year 2004- 05; and (iii) Such other writ order or direction as this Hon'ble Court may deem just and proper in the circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice, be passed in favour of the petitioner. This writ petition which has been dismissed by the High Court vide impugned judgment dated 28.05.2012 holding that the appellant is not entitled to any deductions under Section 42 of the Act in the absence of stipulations to this effect in the Contracts signed between the parties. This decision is the subject matter of challenge before us in the present appeal.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: Now, the facts in detail:\n",
      "Paragraph 6: The Union of India (UOI), through the MoPNG, issued a Notice Inviting Tenders in August 1992 (1992 NIT), along with a Model Production Sharing Contract (MPSC), for Development of Oil and Gas Fields from various companies in relation to some selected oil fields in Gujarat and other States. Article 16 of the above-mentioned MPSC contained a specific provision, which provided certain financial benefits and deductions in relation to taxes etc. that would be allowed to contractors/developers, as per the requirements of Section 42 of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: The MoF by its Office Memorandum dated 18.06.1992, raised an issue that Section 293-A of the Act would not apply to contracts of the nature mentioned above, and that benefits under the special provisions of Section 42 of the Act would not be available to foreign companies, such as the appellant, which enter into such contracts with the Central Government. The MoPNG by its Office Memorandum, dated 22.06.1992 (OM) referred the issue to the Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs specifically seeking its opinion on applicability of Section 42 and Section 293-A of the Act to the 1992 NIT and the MPSC.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: The Ministry of Law gave its opinion dated 21.07.1992 to the effect that benefit of both Section 293A and Section 42 should be extended to foreign companies in order to make their participation in these oil fields viable.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: The appellant (along with its erstwhile joint venture partner Larsen and Toubro Ltd., whose stake was also subsequently acquired by the appellant) submitted its bid dated 29.03.1993 in response to the 1992 NIT.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: The appellant was allotted the Dholka abnd Wavel Oil Fields in Gujarat near Ahmedabad, by the MoPNG. Two production sharing contracts, each dated 20.02.1995, were executed by the appellant with the MoPNG for Dholka and Wavel Oil Fields, respectively (the Two PSCs). According to the appellant, since no amendments to Article 16 of MPSC had been suggested nor contemplated b y the Union of India, it was (and is) the belief and legitimate expectation of the appellant that all the benefits, financial or otherwise, offered in Article 16 of the MPSC to the prospective bidders were duly included in the above two PSCs.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: From 2001 the appellant commenced commercial production from the Dholka and Wavel Oil Fields (delayed on account of the UOI's delay in handling over the fields) and availed the benefits of Section 42 Deductions provided in Article 16 of the MPSC, which were duly allowed by the concerned Income Tax Officer at Ahmedabad. The UOI's share of petroleum profit was also determined in accordance with the assumption that, and on the consideration that the appellant was entitled to the benefit of the Section 42 deductions and the UOI consequently also enjoyed a larger quantum as petroleum profits that it otherwise would have. The accounts and calculations of the appellant claiming the Section 42 deductions and passing on the benefit to the UOI in the form of an increased quantum of petroleum profit in terms of the two PSCs , were duly audited and approved by the MoPNG's government auditors.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: While the things proceeded in the aforesaid manner, it so happened in the case of some other Production Sharing Contracts, which did not specifically contain the fiscal benefits and the deduction envisaged by Article 16 of the MPSC, the Income Tax Authorities questioned the basis on which such assesses had claimed deduction/ allowances under Section 42. This move of the Income Tax Authorities prompted the MoPNG to write OM dated 17.06.2005 to the MoF, Department of Revenue to clarify to the relevant Income-Tax Authorities that the provisions of Section 42 of the Income-Tax Act would be applicable to all PSCs, including those thirteen (13) PSCs executed by the Union of India, which did not expressly contain these provisions, for the purpose of computing profits and gains, after allowing the Section 42 deductions. The appellant's two PSCs are among these thirteen (13) PSCs referred to by the MoPNG in this Office Memorandum. The OM noted that it would not be equitable and fair if Section 42 deductions were denied in respect of these 13 PSCs.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: Since the entire dispute pertains to deductions under Section 42 of the Act, at this stage we reproduce the said provisions hereunder:\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 42. Special provision for deductions in the case of business for prospecting, etc., for mineral oil.[(1)] For the purpose of computing the profits or gains of any business consisting of the prospecting for or extraction or production of mineral oils in relation to which the Central Government has entered into an agreement with any person for the association or participation 90[of the Central Government or any person authorised by it in such business] (which agreement has been laid on the Table of each House of Parliament), there shall be made in lieu of, or in addition to, the allowances admissible under this Act, such allowances as are specified in the agreement in relation (a) to expenditure by way of infructuous or abortive exploration expenses in respect of any area surrendered prior to the beginning of commercial production by the assessee;\n",
      "Paragraph 15: (b) after the beginning of commercial production, to expenditure incurred by the assessee, whether before or after such commercial production, in respect of drilling or exploration activities or services or in respect of physical assets used in that connection, except assets on which allowance for depreciation is admissible under Section 32:\n",
      "Paragraph 16: [Provided that in relation to any agreement entered into after the 31st day of March, 1981, this clause shall have effect subject to the modification that the words and figures \"except assets on which allowance for depreciation is admissible under Section 32\" had been omitted; and] (c) to the depletion of mineral oil in the mining area in respect of the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which commercial production is begun and for such succeeding year or years as may be specified in the agreement;\n",
      "Paragraph 17: and such allowances shall be computed and made in the manner specified in the agreement, the other provisions of this Act being deemed for this purpose to have been modified to the extent necessary to give effect to the terms of the agreement:\n",
      "Paragraph 18: [(2) Where the business of the assessee consisting of the prospecting for or extraction or production of petroleum and natural gas is transferred wholly or partly or any interest in such business is transferred in accordance with the agreement referred to in sub-section (1), subject to the provisions of the said agreement and where the proceeds of the transfer (so far as they consist of capital sums) (a) are less than the expenditure incurred remaining unallowed, a deduction equal to such expenditure remaining unallowed, as reduced by the proceeds of transfer, shall be allowed in respect of the previous year in which such business or interest, as the case may be, is transferred;\n",
      "Paragraph 19: (b) exceed the amount of the expenditure incurred remaining unallowed, so much of the excess as does not exceed the difference between the expenditure incurred in connection with the business or to obtain interest therein and the amount of such expenditure remaining unallowed, shall be chargeable to income- tax as profits and gains of the business in the previous year in which the business or interest therein, whether wholly or partly, had been transferred:\n",
      "Paragraph 20: Provided that in a case where the provisions of this clause do not apply, the deduction to be allowed for expenditure incurred remaining unallowed shall be arrived at by subtracting the proceeds of transfer (so far as they consist of capital sums) from the expenditure remaining unallowed.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: Explanation.Where the business or interest in such business is transferred in a previous year in which such business carried on by the assessee is no longer in existence, the provisions of this clause shall apply as if the business is in existence in that previous year;\n",
      "Paragraph 22: (c) are not less than the amount of the expenditure incurred remaining unallowed, no deduction for such expenditure shall be allowed in respect of the previous year in which the business or interest in such business is transferred or in respect of any subsequent year or years:\n",
      "Paragraph 23: [Provided that where in a scheme of amalgamation or demerger, the amalgamating or the demerged company sells or otherwise transfers the business to the amalgamated or the resulting company (being an Indian company), the provisions of this sub-section (i) shall not apply in the case of the amalgamating or the demerged company; and (ii) shall, as far as may be, apply to the amalgamated or the resulting company as they would have applied to the amalgamating or the demerged company if the latter had not transferred the business or interest in the business.] [Explanation.For the purposes of this section, \"mineral oil\"\n",
      "Paragraph 24: includes petroleum and natural gas.] Meanwhile, the Income-Tax Officer, Ward I(3) (hereinafter referred to as the ITO Wd I (3)) issued a notice dated 09.06.2006 under Section 143 (2) of the Income Tax Act to the appellant for the Assessment Year 2005-2006 and asked the appellant to justify its claim for the Section 42 deductions.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: The ITO Wd I(3) also issued another notice to the appellant under Section 142(1) of the Income-Tax Act, seeking various details and data relevant to the said Assessment Year. The case was later transferred to the Assistant Director of Income-Tax (International Taxation), Ahmedabad (ADIT). The ADIT also raised the question of applicability of the Section 42 deductions to the two PSCs executed by the appellant for the reason that such a clause was not specifically included in these two PSCs.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: A Joint Secretary of the MoPNG vide his communication dated 11.04.2007 wrote to the MoF specifically admitting that in 11 PSCs, a reference to Section 42 deductions had been omitted by oversight. It was also stated that contracts signed in respect of other fields at the same time contained the provision for Section 42 deductions. It was specifically stated that Petroleum operations are a high risk business and it may not be equitable and fair if companies are not allowed to claim allowances for their expenditure. Besides it would be difficult to justify different standards for different PSCs signed under one regime. (emphasis supplied). A clarification was also sought from the MoF to the revenue authorities that the Section 42 deductions should be uniformly granted irrespective of whether the PSCs contained the relevant clause or not. It is pertinent to note that in this letter, the appellant was listed by the MoPNG as having the provision for Section 42 deductions in its two PSCs, which though factually incorrect, again underscores the bona fide belief of the UOI through the MoPNG that the appellant had been granted the Section 42 deductions in respect of its two PSCs.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: However, MoF did not issue any such clarification. In the absence of such a clarification from the Ministry of Finance, the ADIT disallowed appellant's claim for deduction under Section 42(1)(b) and Section 42(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act, made in the appellant's Income-Tax Return for the Assessment Year 2005-2006, on the ground that a specific reference to the Section 42 deduction has not been made3 expressly in the two PSCs (hereinafter the ADIT's Order). As a result, the ADIT issued a demand notice under Section 156 of the Income Tax Act to the appellant, demanding payment of Rs. 1,24,45,509.00 (rupees one crore twenty four lakhs forty five thousand five hundred and nine only) by way of additional tax, interest and penalty. The appellant preferred an appeal against the ADIT's order before the relevant Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) in Ahmedabad and deposited the sum of Rs.40,00,000/- (rupees forty lakhs only), as required by ADIT, while himself staying the demand raised by Assessment Order. This appeal has been dismissed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and a further appeal is now pending before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: In the meanwhile, on 24.12.2007, the appellant required the Union of India, through the MoPNG and the MoF, to issue an appropriate clarification/amendment with respect to the two PSCs executed with the appellant, taking a stance that it was always the intention of the Union of India, at all stages, to give the benefits of Section 42 Deductions of the Income Tax Act, read with Article 16 of the MPSC, to all the entities who had entered into PSCs with it, including the appellant with the plea that the non-inclusion of this provision in the two PSCs signed with the appellant was a clerical error/oversight. This was followed by reminder dated 19.3.2008 again requesting the Union of India, through the MoPNG and the MoF, to issue an appropriate clarification/amendment with respect o the two PSCs executed with the appellant.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: No such clarification came forward. On the other hand, the ADIT issued notice dated 28.3.2008 to the appellant under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act for reopening the appellant's Income Tax Returns for the Assessment Years 2001-2002, 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. At this juncture, the Secretary, MoPNG, wrote communication dated 28.04.2008 to the MoF pointing about the said accidental omissions again in the contract. The MoF was, accordingly, requested to extend the benefits of Section 42 Deductions to the 13 PSCs (including the appellant's two PSCs) in line with all other signed PSCs.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: As, in the meantime, the ADIT was going ahead with the proceedings pursuant to the notice under Section 148 of the Act deciding to reopen the assessment of the appellant in respect of assessment years 2001-02 to 2004- 05, the appellant sent one more representation dated 23.06.2008 on the same lines on which it had been making the similar representations earlier. No positive response was, however, received. Exasperated, the appellant approached the High Court by way of writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. Counter affidavits to the writ petition was filed by the respondent  Authorities taking preliminary objection pertaining to territorial jurisdiction of the High Court of Delhi and also raising the ground of alternate remedies available in the law in the form of appeal before the ITAT which had already been preferred by the appellant.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: Rejoinder thereto was filed by the appellant. Thereafter, another counter affidavit on merits was filed by the respondent no. 1\\. In this counter affidavit, stand was taken by the respondents that MPSC would not apply to appellant's two PSCs. The appellant filed rejoinder to this counter affidavit controverting the stand which was taken by the respondent.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: Thereafter, the respondent filed another supplementary affidavit stating that MoF had not concurred with the proposal to extend the benefit of deductions under Section 42 of the Act vide MoF O.M. dated 11.11.2009.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: Short affidavits were also filed by MoF as well as ADIT taking the position that the appellant was not entitled to benefit of Section 42 of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: Rejoinder to these short affidavits was filed by the appellant. Rejoinder was also filed to the supplementary affidavit which has been filed by respondent no. 1. The appellant also filed additional affidavit dated 28.02.2012 giving details of other small sized discovered oil fields PSCs, who were awarded contracts under 1992 NIT, submitting that they were identical to the appellant and in their case clause was inserted giving benefit under Section 42 of the Act. It was pleaded that since they were identically situated as the appellant herein, denying such a benefit to the appellant amounted to hostile discrimination. By another affidavit filed by the appellant, it also tried to demonstrate that respondent no. 1 had accepted the calculation of petroleum profits on the assumption that the deduction under Section 42 was available to the appellant; otherwise the appellant would have enjoyed increased profits . It was, thus, sought to be demonstrated that even while profit sharing, shares were calculated keeping in view the deductions under Section 42 of the Act thereby giving better and increased profit sharing to the Government as well.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: The matter was ultimately heard by the High Court which has dismissed the writ petition by passing detailed judgment on 28.05.2012. Before we come to the arguments of the appellant challenging the correctness of this judgment, it may be appropriate to take note of reasons which have been given by the High Court in support of the view it has taken.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: The High Court took note of the basic and primary contention of the appellant which was that there was a clear understanding between the MoPNG and the appellant that in the contract to be signed between the parties benefits under Section 42 of the Act would be admissible. The NIT issued by the Government was based on this basic understanding but due to inadvertent oversight and error on the part of the MoPNG the contract, which was ultimately signed, omitted to include such a clause. Therefore, on account of mistake of the Ministry, which even it admitted in its communications when the dispute regarding admissibility of deduction under Section 42 of the Act arose, the appellant should not be allowed to suffer. More so, when it was not responsible for the said error.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: It may be pertinent to point out that the High Court did not accept the preliminary objections raised by the respondent and after repelling the same, it adverted to the subject matter of the writ petitions. On the merits of the issue involved, the High Court formulated two questions .\n",
      "Paragraph 38: These are:\n",
      "Paragraph 39: (1) Whether benefit under Section 42 of the Act was envisaged in the 1992 NIT and in the PSCs, but due to oversight or mistake, the same was not included and mentioned in the written contract, and if so, the effect thereof? (2) If the question is decided in favour of the appellant, the second aspect is whether a direction can be issued for grant of benefit under Section 42 of the Act to the appellant, with a further direction that the contract should be laid before the Parliament after incorporating the said clause? Dealing with the first question, High Court rejected the plea of the appellant that 1992 NIT included and referred to the MPSC as incorrect. It is pointed out that the 1992 NIT did not refer to the MPSC and did not stipulate that MPSC shall form part of the tender documents. It is further stated by the High Court that in 1992 NII, there was no reference to MPSC or that the terms and conditions of the MPSC shall be included in, or be a part of, the PSCs. It is also observed that there is no document or clause in the bid given by the appellant under the 1992 NIT to the effect that the MPSC or clause 16.2 of the same would be applicable and should be a part of the PSCs. In the tender submitted by the appellant there was no specific stipulation to include any clause with regard to the benefit under Section 42 of the Act. The High Court has further observed that written contracts were signed between the appellant and MoPNG in the name of President on 20.,02.1995. Clause 15 of these contracts which pertain to Taxes, Royalties, Rentals, Customs duties etc. though mentions about the applicability of fiscal, there is no reference to Section 42 of the Act in this Clause.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: The High Court further pointed out that there was no letter or correspondence written by the appellant from 1995 onwards stating that non- inclusion of Section 42 benefit was due to oversight. Insofar as three letters written by the MoPNG, namely, letters dated 17-06-2005, 11-04-2007 and 28-04-2008 are concerned wherein this Ministry admitted that there was an unintentional lapse and omission in not incorporating the provision of admissible deduction under Section 42 of the Act, the High Court has brushed aside these communications as inter-ministerial correspondence.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: These letters were apparently written on the request of the appellant or NIKO Resources Limited. It is further mentioned that these are not contemporaneous letters written at the time when PSCs were signed.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: The High Court has also commented that though in these letters it is mentioned that Section 42 deductions were omitted by oversight in fact there was no such oversight in as much as the MoPNG itself in its counter affidavit has specifically stated that no such benefit was envisaged, considered or granted at the time when the PSCs were negotiated and awarded. Averments made in this behalf in the counter affidavit filed by the MoPNG are extensively quoted. To verify this position, the High Court also examined and went through the original files relating to preparation and finalisation of tender documents and made following remarks in this behalf.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: In order to verify and examine the correct factual position, we had asked the respondent Ministry of Petroleum and oversight in as much as the MoPNG itself in its counter affidavit has specifically stated that no such benefit was envisaged, considered or granted at the time Natural Gas to produce the original files relating to preparation and finalization of tender documents. They were produced before us on 21st February, 2012. We examined the original records and found that under the terms and conditions, as well as in the notes, no benefit under Section 42 of the Act was envisaged or was required to be granted. We also recorded the statement of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the three letters mentioned above were factually incorrect and, therefore, no legal right on the basis of the letters accrues/arises. Thus, no statement or promise, that advantage under Section 42 would be available to the successful bidder, was promised or made. Insofar as plea of discrimination between 13 PSCs (which included the appellant), who are not given the benefit of Section 42 of the Act vis-a- vis other PSCs where such a benefit has been extended, the High Court has accepted the explanation put forth by the respondents to the effect that these 13 PSCs formed a different class in as much as their contract was in respect of small oil fields which had already been discovered and, therefore, the risk factor was less. On the other hand, other PSCs were in respect of undiscovered oil fields and for this reason benefit under Section 42 had been granted to them.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: On the aforesaid reasoning, the High Court concluded that appellant was fully aware of Clause 16.2 of MPSC which specifically makes reference to benefit under Section 42 of the Act, but did not advert to and refer to the same in their tender bid and did not ask for this benefit. Therefore, it was not possible to accept the contention of the appellant that benefit under Section 42 of the Act was inadvertently missed out, or due to an act of oversight, not included in the contract. On this finding, the High Court chose not to examine the second issue. Post by it in para 9 of the impugned judgment and noted by us above.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: We would also like to mention that in the penultimate para, the High Court has expressed its displeasure and anguish over the averments made by respondent no. 1 in the additional affidavit dated 23-03-2012 where respondent no. 1 even denied the fact that petroleum profits were not shared between the Government and the appellant after making the calculations with reference to benefit under Section 42 of the Act. In letter dated 11.11.2009 written by the MoF, Department of Revenue this fact is specifically admitted and, therefore, respondent no. 1 should have been careful in making such averments in the said additional affidavit which were contrary to the record, even if it was uncomfortable to respondent no.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 1\\.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: Mr. Ganesh, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the High Court had failed to appreciate and cognise the basic issue which had arisen in the instant case about the admissibility of the benefit of Section 42 of the Act in respect of two production sharing contracts (PSCs) between the appellant and the Government. He submitted that the claim for the benefit of the aforesaid provision was predicated on the following grounds:\n",
      "Paragraph 48: (a) The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG) had invited bids for the said oilfields on the basis of a Model Production Sharing Contract (MPSC) which specifically and unequivocally provided that the benefit of Section 42 would be granted.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: (b) The appellant's bids for the said two oilfields were clearly and indisputably submitted on the footing that the MPSC would govern the contract between the parties. In fact, in its bid, the appellant only referred to those clauses of the MPSC which the appellant wanted to be slightly modified, to which the Government had no objection. Thus, the appellant's bids were on the basis of the MPSC which provided the benefit of Section 42.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: (c) Respondent no. 1 itself admitted that the contract was entered into, keeping in view the stipulations/terms contained in the MPSC and, therefore, MPSC had to be read into the contract. It was also argued that these facts were specifically confirmed by respondent no. 1 itself in its three letters dated 17-06-2005, 11-04-2007 and 28-04-2008.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: (d) It was, thus, argued that as held in the case of [?CITATION?], it is the mutual understanding of the parties to a contract which determines the construction that the court will place on it and this principle squarely applied in the present case.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: (e) The accounts of the venture were drawn up on the footing that the deductions under Sect5ion 42 were available and that, accordingly, the Income Tax liability would stand reduced. On this footing, a significantly higher amount was computed as the profit share payable to the Government of India under the PSC, which was received by the Government year after year.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: (f) The reference made by MoPNG to the Ministry of Law in June/ July 1992 and the written opinion given by the Ministry of Law also by themselves clearly established that the intention of the Government from the very beginning was to grant the benefit of Section 42.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: (g) The I.T. Department itself granted the deductions under Section 42 for several years right upto Assessment Year 2004-05 and then suddenly and unaccountably changed its mind and turned a somersault.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: (h) The benefit of Section 42 was, in fact, granted to several other small- sized discovered oilfields. The appellant had filed an additional affidavit dated 28.02.2012 giving particulars of at least 11 other small- sized discovered oilfields to which benefit of Section 42 was given. Even though the contents of the affidavit remained untraversed, the same has been completely disregarded by the High Court. Relying on the aforesaid material on which Mr. Ganesh laid great emphasis, his plea was that the High Court did not consider the aforesaid aspects in its right perspective and arrived at a wrong finding that the appellant did not ask for the benefit of Section 42 of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: He further submitted that strong reliance was placed by the High Court on the contents of a file which was produced by respondent no. 1 relating to the preparation of tender documents. However, this file was not shown to the appellant or its counsel and the appellant was, thus, denied any opportunity of dealing with the same. He pointed out that the appellant had specifically filed an application dated 28-02-2012 praying that the Court should not consider the contents of the said file or alternatively the copies of the documents in the file be supplied to the counsel of the appellant. On this application, the Court had made observation on 12.03- 2012 to the effect that it was not going to place any reliance on the contents of the file and with these observations the application was dismissed. However, in the impugned judgment, the High Court has rested its conclusion on the basis of some contents in the file. He further submitted that the Court should not have disregarded the letters of the respondent no. 1 on the ground that they were not contemporaneous letters. His submission was that right upto the year 2005, the benefit of Section 42 was extended to the appellant and, therefore, there was no occasion for the appellant to approach respondent no. 1 to ask for such a clarification. He further submitted that reliance placed by the High Court on certain paras of the counter affidavit of respondent no. 1 was totally erroneous as such a stand taken in the counter affidavit was contrary to the letters which were addressed by the respondent no. 1 itself to the MoF but according to him, the manner in which the plea of discrimination was dealt with by the High Court was also erroneous ignoring the specific plea taken by the appellant in its additional affidavit dated 28-02-2012 giving particulars of a number of small-sized oil fields to which Section 42 benefit was given and the Government had not controverted those averments. He submitted that apart from the plea, 13 oil fields (which included the appellant) all other oil fields, whether large, medium or small sized, and whether discovered or exploratory, were given the benefit of Section 42 of the Act. Therefore, the respondents had acted in a grossly arbitrary and discriminatory manner.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: Last submission of Mr. Ganesh was that the issue regarding Mandamus to be issued to the respondents for amending the contract and including the clause for granting the benefit of Section 42 of the Act was not even gone into, though, it was specifically argued. He further submitted that when the other contracting parties, namely, MoPNG specifically admitted that this provision was left our inadvertently, the Court should have given a direction for amendment of the Contract. In order to support his submission that such a direction can be issued by the High Court in exercise of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, he referred to the following judgments:\n",
      "Paragraph 58: Mr. Arijit Prasad, Advocate, who appeared for all the respondents countered the aforesaid submissions emphatically and passionately. He argued that insofar as income tax department is concerned it could extend the benefit of deductions admissible under Section 42 of the Act only when the assessee, namely, the appellant in the instant case, fulfilled the conditions for such deductions stipulated in that Section. For this purpose, the income tax authorities were supposed to look into the PSCs only and as far as the contracts between the Government and the appellant are concerned, admittedly there was no such stipulation therein. Nor these contracts were placed before both the House of Parliament. Therefore, the order of the Assessing Authorities in tune with legal provisions. He further submitted that in any case the appeal of the appellant was pending before the ITAT and it was for the ITAT to go into the submissions made by the appellants on the admissibility of deduction under Section 42 of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: In respect of the three letters which were written by the respondent no. 1, his submission was that no reliance could have been placed on those letters and the matter had to be examined on the basis of record. The High Court had, for this purpose, examined the original files on the basis of which it was clearly found that the averments made in the three letters ware not born out of records.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: He also made detailed submissions to support the findings of the High Court that there was no inadvertent omission in failing to make any stipulation with regard to extending the benefits of Section 42 of the Act and on the contrary insofar as the appellant and 12 other similar parties are concerned, there was a deliberate decision not to extend such a benefit. He also argued that in any case plea of discrimination could not be taken in the matters of contract in private law field.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: Reacting to the relief of mandamus sought by the appellant seeking directions against Respondent No. 1 to amend the contract, his plea was that such a prayer, in the realm of contractual relationship between the parties, was inadmissible. He pleaded that PSCs are in the nature of contract agreed to be between two independent contracting parties and each of the PSCs are distinct from the other and is not a copy of MPSC. He also pointed out that before signing the PSC, the approval of the Cabinet is obtained, which reflects that the PSCs as submitted to the Cabinet, has the approval of one of the contracting party, i.e. Government of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: Therefore, the appellant could not claim to be oblivious of the provisions of law or the contents of the contract at the time of signing and was precluded from seeking retrospective amendment as a matter of right when no such right is conferred under the contract. In support of his submission that the doctrine of fairness and reasonableness applies only in the exercise of statutory or administrative actions of a State and not in the exercise of a contractual obligation and that the issues arising out of contractual matters will have to be decided on the basis of the law of contract and not on the basis of the administrative law, he referred to and relied upon the judgments in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 63: From the reading of the writ petition filed in the High Court, the impugned judgment rendered by the High Court thereupon, and also having regard to the arguments advanced before us which have already been taken note of, it is apparent that the fulcrum of the issue, which has to be focused and to be answered, pertains to the benefit of the deductions permissible under Section 42 of the Act. In fact, as is clear from the prayers made by the appellant in the writ petition, the very first direction which the appellant sought was to declare that the appellant is entitled to such deductions in terms of the two PSCs dated 20-02-1995. Incidental issues, while deciding the aforesaid primary issue, which arises relate to the construction of the terms of the said PSCs and also the nature of the contracts which the parties intended to. Another issue relates to the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to pass Mandamus for amending the PSCs. All these issues are formulated in the precise form hereunder:\n",
      "Paragraph 64: (i) Whether in terms of the provisions contained in two Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) dated 20-02-1995 executed between the appellant and the Central Government, appellant is entitled to the special allowances stipulated under Section 42 of the Act? (ii) Whether Model Production Sharing Contract (MPSC) can be read as part of and incorporated in the PSCs? (iii) Whether there was any intention between the contracting parties, namely, the MoPNG and the appellant for giving benefit of deductions under Section 42 of the Act? (iv) If so, whether non-inclusion of such a provision in the contract can be treated as accidental and unintentional omission.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: (v) If the answer to question no. (iv) is in the affirmative, whether mandamus can be issued by the Court to the parties to amend the contract and incorporate provisions to this effect? We would now proceed to answer these questions seriatum.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: Answer to question No. (i)  First and foremost aspect which has to be kept in mind while answering this issue is that the Income Tax Authorities while making assessment of income of any assessee have to apply the provisions of the Income Tax Act and make assessment accordingly. Translating this as general proposition contextually, what we intend to convey is that the Assessing Officer is supposed to focus on Section 42 of the Act on the basis of which he is to decide as to whether deductions mentioned in the said provision are admissible to the assessee who is claiming those deductions. In other words, the Assessing Officer is supposed to find out as to whether the assessee fulfills the eligibility conditions in the said provision to be entitled to such deductions. We have already reproduced the language of Section 42, which deals with special provisions of deductions in the case of business for prospecting, etc. for mineral oil.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: Since, the appellant herein, in its income tax returns for the assessment year in question, i.e., Assessment Year 2005-06, had claimed the deductions mentioned in Section 42(1)(b) and (c) of the Act, we should take note of the nature of these deductions. Section 42(1)(b) provides for deductions of expenditure incurred in respect of drilling or exploration activities or services or in respect of physical assets used in that connection, except for those assets on which allowance for depreciation is admissible under Section 32. Section 42(1)(c) speaks of allowances pertaining to the depletion of mineral oil in the mining area. In order to be eligible to the deductions, certain conditions are stipulated in this very section which have to be satisfied by the assessees. As is clear from the reading of this Section, these conditions are as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 68: (a) it grants such special allowances to those assessees who carry on business in association with the Central Government or with any person authorized by it;\n",
      "Paragraph 69: (b) business should relate to prospecting for, extracting or producing mineral oils, petroleum or natural gas;\n",
      "Paragraph 70: (c) there has to be an agreement in writing between the Central Government and the assessees in this behalf;\n",
      "Paragraph 71: (d) it is also a requirement that such an agreement has been laid on the Table of each House of Parliament;\n",
      "Paragraph 72: (e) the allowances which are claimed are to be necessarily specified in the agreement entered into between the two contracting parties; and (f) allowances are to be computed and made in the manner specified in the agreement.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: From the nature of allowances specified in this provision, it is clear that such allowances are otherwise inadmissible on general principles, for e.g.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: allowances relating to diminution or exhaustion of wasting capital assets or allowances in respect of expenditure which would be regarded as on capital account on the ground that it brings an asset of enduring benefit into existence or constitutes initial expenditure incurred in setting up the profit earning machinery in motion. It is for this reason this Section itself clarifies that the provisions of this Act would be deemed to have been modified to the extent necessary to give effect to the terms of the agreement, as otherwise, the other provisions of the Act specifically deny such deductions. A fortiorari, the PSC entered into between the parties becomes an independent accounting regime and its provisions prevail over generally accepted principles of accounting that are used for ascertaining taxable income (See  [?CITATION?]). Thus, by virtue of this Section, it is the PSC which governs the field as without it, such deductions are not permissible under the Act. IF PSC also does not contain any stipulation providing for such allowances, the Assessing Officer would be unable to give the benefit of these deductions to the assesee.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: We would also like to point out, at this juncture itself, that this Court held in [?CITATION?] that the mere fact that the assessee had offered to pay tax under Section 44 (BB) of the Act in some of the earlier years will not operate as an estoppel to claim the benefit of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), where the assessee operates under the same PSC which was before the Court. While holding so, the Court had followed its earlier judgment in the case of Enron Oil and Gas India Limited (Supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 76: In the present case, it is an admitted fact that conditions mentioned in Section 42 of the Act are not fulfilled. In the two PSCs, no provision is made for making admissible the aforesaid allowances to the assessee. It is obvious that the Assessing Officer could not have granted these allowances/deductions to the assessee in the absence of such stipulations, a mandatory requirement, in the PSCs.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: The appellant is conscious of this position. It is for this reason the attempt of the appellant was to read the provisions of MPSC into the agreement. That bring us to the second issue.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: Answer to question no. (ii) - Endeavour of Mr. Ganesh, on this aspect, was to show that the bids were invited on the basis of terms stated in the MPSC which specifically mentioned about deductions under Section 42 of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: He also endeavored to demonstrate that thee appellant had submitted its bid keeping in view such a categorical stipulation in the MPSC. He also pointed out that on MPSC, opinion of Law Ministry was solicited vide Memo dated 22-06-1992 and that the Ministry of Law gave its opinion dated 21-07- 1997 opining that benefit of both Sections 293(A) and Section 42 of the Act should be extended to the foreign companies in order to make their participation in these oil fields viable. As per the appellant, it was also made abundantly clear by the Ministry of Law that it was in relation to foreign companies to be engaged in exploration, development and production of oil ion small sized oil and gas fields under the proposed Production Sharing Contract, thus, drawing no distinction between fields to be explored and those already discovered and also making specific reference to the MPSC. Taking sustenance from the aforesaid material, a passionate plea was made by Mr. Ganesh to read the provisions of Section 42 contained in MPSC, as opined by the Ministry of Law, into the PSCs which were ultimately signed between the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: In order to appreciate this argument, we shall have to traverse through the PSCs dated 20-02-1995 which were ultimately signed between the Government and the appellant. We would like to mention here that when this argument was being advanced by the learned senior counsel for the appellant the Court asked him to produce the copy of PSCs, which were otherwise not brought on the record as the Court wanted to find out as to whether there was any such intention expressed in the agreement, namely, to incorporate the provisions of MPSC or the correspondence exchanged between the parties earlier to the signing of this agreement. On our asking, the appellant has placed on record the copy of these PSCs. On going through the same, we find that intention expressed is just to the contrary. It is rather made crystal clear in the agreement that this agreement is the sole repository of the terms on which it is signed and nothing else would be looked into for this purpose. It is so reflected in the following clauses in the agreement:\n",
      "Paragraph 81: (5) The Government has agreed to enter into this Contract with the Companies with respect to the area referred to in Appendices A & B of this Contract on the terms and conditions herein set forth. Article 1  In this Contract, unless the context requires otherwise, the following terms shall have the meaning ascribed to the then hereunder:\n",
      "Paragraph 82: xxx xxx xxx Article 1.18 Contract means this agreement and the Appendices mentioned herein and attached hereto and made an integral part hereof and any amendments made thereto pursuant to the terms hereof.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: Article 32 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT, AMENDMENTS, WAIVER AND MISCELLANEOUS\n",
      "Paragraph 84: 32.1 This Contract supersedes and replaces any previous agreement of understanding between the Parties, whether oral or written, on the subject matter hereof, prior to the Effective Date of this Contract.\n",
      "Paragraph 85: 32.2 This Contract shall not be amended, modified, varied or supplemented in any respect except by an instrument in writing signed by all the Parties, which shall state the date upon which the amendment or modification shall become effective.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: 32.3 No waiver by any Party of any one or more obligations or defaults by any other Party in the performance of this Contract shall operate or be construed as a waiver of any other obligations or defaults whether of a like or of a different character.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: 32.4 The provisions of this Contract shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their permitted assigns and successors in interest.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: 32.5 In the event of any conflict between any provisions in the main body of this Contract and any provision in the Appendices, the provision in the main body shall prevail.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: 32.6 The headings of this Contract are for convenience of reference only and shall not be taken into account in interpreting the terms of this Contract. Intention behind the aforesaid clauses is more than apparent, namely, not to look into any other document or correspondence which took place between the parties prior to the signing of this agreement. Not only this, even the so- called understanding between the parties is to be ignored as well. It is, therefore, impermissible for the appellant to take the aid of MPSC or the clauses contained therein while construing the terms of PSCs.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: Therefore, it was not even open to the Income Tax Authorities to go beyond the stipulations contained in the PSCs while making the assessment and had to exclusively remain within the provisions of the Agreement. On that touchstone, the Assessing Officer had no option but to deny the benefit of deductions/allowances claimed by the appellant in its income tax returns filed for the Assessment Year 2005-06. This bring us to the next question.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: Answer to question no. (iii) - We have already noted that Article 32.2 categorically provides that this Contract shall not be amended, modified, varied or supplemented in any respect except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties, which shall state the date upon which the amendment or modification shall become effective. In continuation to what has been observed by us while answering point no. (ii) above, it becomes apparent that the question of any intention to the contrary between the parties does not arise. It is because of the reason that Article 32 of the Agreement specifically supersedes any understanding between the parties prior to the effective date of this contract.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: The matter is, however, compounded by certain acts of respondent no. 1 and made complex to some extent by the Income Tax Authorities in giving benefit of these allowances/deductions under Section 42 of the Act to the appellant under these very PSCs in respect of earlier assessment years. Further, this very state of affairs continued for few years insofar as giving such a benefit by the Income Tax Authorities is concerned it may not pose a serious problem. We have already held above that on proper construction of the provisions of Section 42 of the Act and application of these provisions to the instant case, the appellant was not entitled to any such deductions under the PSCs. Thus, when in law no such deduction was permissible as per the PSCs in the present form, even if such deduction was given wrongly in the earlier years that would not amount to a wrong act on the part of the Income Tax Authorities and, therefore, would not enure to the benefit of the appellant in the Assessment Year in question as well. The appellant cannot say that merely because this benefit is extended in the previous years; albeit wrongly, this wrong act should continue to perpetuate. There is no estoppel against law. We have taken note of the judgment of this Court in Enron Expat Service Inc. (Supra) where the assessee had offered to pay tax under Section 44(BB) of the Act in the earlier years wrongly and the Court held that it would not operate as an estoppel to claim the benefit of DTAA for the Assessment Year in question when it was found that the assessee was otherwise entitled to it. Same principle applies, though it is a converse situation where assessee has not offered to pay tax wrongly [which was the situation in Enron Expat Service Inc. (Supra)] and instead the tax authorities have extended the benefit wrongly to the assessee.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: With this, we come to more crucial aspect, namely, the three letters written by the MoPNG in response to the appellant's communications seeking its clarification. Undoubtedly, in these three letters the MoPNG has accepted that intention between the parties was to give the benefit of allowances under Section 42 of the Act to the appellant herein. So much so, the MoPNG even requested the MoF to give its nod for amending the contract by incorporating such a provision which was allegedly left out inadvertently.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: Our first remark is that the approach of the High Court in dealing with this aspect may not be entirely correct. In the first instance, it has embarked upon the issue as to whether such an omission was by way of oversight or it was unintentional. While undertaking this enquiry, it has side tracked the language of the three letters and instead gone by the stand taken in the counter affidavit filed by respondent no. 1 where, in para 4 of the counter affidavit, respondent no. 1 pleaded to the contrary.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: Clearly, the said stand taken in the counter affidavit filed in the High Court was contrary to the contents of the three letters dated 17.06.2005, 11.04.2007 and 28.04.2008. Significantly, respondent no. 1 neither disowned those letters nor tried to explain away those letters. No plea was raised to the effect that the person who wrote those letters was not authorized to do so or he had taken the said stand in the letters which was contrary to the records. No doubt, the High Court has observed that it had looked into original record in order to verify and examine the correct factual position. However, as demonstrated by Mr. Ganesh, on an application made by the appellant in the High Court for giving the copies of such records, the High Court had observed that those records would not be seen nut ultimately relied upon these records. We do not know whether the High Court is correct in its conclusion as to whether the contents of the three letters are contrary to records and the averments made in para 4 of the counter affidavit are in conformity with the records, in as much as these records have not been produced for our perusal. However, on going through the terms of the PSCs it becomes apparent that such an exercise is not even required.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: It is stated at the cost of repetition that Article 32 of the contract supersedes any understanding between the parties. Thus, even if it is presumed that there was an understanding between the parties before entering into an agreement to the effect that benefit of Section 42 deduction shall be extended to the appellant, that understanding vanished into thin air with the execution of the two PSCs. Now, for all intent and purpose, it is only the PSCs signed between the parties, which can be looked into. We answer this question accordingly.\n",
      "Paragraph 97: Undoubtedly, the appellant is also conscious of such a limitation and is aware of the fact that unless there is a clear stipulation in the PSCs for grant of benefit of special allowances under Section 42 of the Act, it would be difficult, nay impossible, for the appellant to sail through. It is for this reason Mr. Ganesh, learned senior counsel for the appellant made a fervent plea that respondents be directed to carry out the amendment in the contract to include stipulation with regard to Section 42 as well. That bring us to the next question about the permissibility of such a prayer.\n",
      "Paragraph 98: Answer to question no. (iv) & (v)  These issues have three facets, namely:\n",
      "Paragraph 99: (i) Whether there is a prayer to this effect in the writ petition? (ii) If it was intended to give such a benefit before entering into the agreement, whether this intention gives any right to the appellant to seek an amendment? (iii) Whether the Court has the power to issue Mandamus or direction to the Government? We have reproduced the prayers made in the writ petition. Obviously, no prayer for issuance of Writ of Mandamus or direction of this nature is specifically made. Prayer clause shows that there are two prayers made in the writ petition. First relates to directing the Authorities to grant benefit under Section 42 of the Act in terms of PSCs dated 22.02.1995, i.e.\n",
      "Paragraph 100: it is confined within the scope of the said contracts. Though, the appellant wants that while construing these contracts MPSCs and other several communications between the parties should be looked into and given effect to. We have already held that all such communications would be extraneous and it is only the terms of PSCs dated 20.02.1995 which can be looked into. Second prayer aims at seeking quashing of orders dated 31.12.2007 and notices dated 28.03.2008 and 01.05.2008 vide which income tax assessments for Assessment Years 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04; AND 2004-05 respectively are sought to be re- opened.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: Mr. Ganesh, however, submitted that such a prayer should be culled out from prayer no. (iii) which is residual in nature. Ordinarily, it would be difficult to read into this prayer clause a relief of substantive nature of issuing the writ of mandamus. However, we find that there are specific averments to this effect in the body of the writ petition as well as in the grounds. More pertinently this relief was specifically pressed and argued in the High Court which was even entertained by the High Court without any objections from the respondent to the contrary. Therefore, we are inclined to examine the plea on merits, though reluctantly.\n",
      "Paragraph 102: Let us presume that there was such an intention. In fact, it is so stated in the three letters dated 17-06-2005, 11-04-2007 and 28-04-2008 which are written by MoPNG and not disowned by it. Still such an intention would not make any difference and for this purpose we again revert back to Article 32 which has already been reproduced above. Not only prior understanding between the parties stood superseded as mentioned in Article 32.1, Article\n",
      "Paragraph 103: 32.2 which is crucial to answer this question, bars any amendment, modification etc. to the said contract except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties. Thus, unless respondents agree to amend, modify or varied/supplemented the terms of the contract, no right accrues to the appellant in this behalf.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: We have to keep in mind that the contract in question is governed by the provisions of Article 299 of the Constitution. These are formal contracts made in the exercise of the Executive power of the Union (or of a State, as the case may be) and are made on behalf of the President (or by the Governor, as the case may be). Further, these contracts are to be made by such persons and in such a manner as the President or the Governor may direct or authorize. Thus, when a particular contract is entered into, its novation has to be on fulfillment of all procedural requirements. No doubt, there is an exception to this principle, viz. even in the absence of a contract according to the requirements of Article 299 of the Constitution, doctrine of promissory estoppel can still be invoked against the Government. However, no such case is pleaded by the appellant. To dilate upon the aforesaid proposition further, we take along third facet of this issue as, to some extent, they are over- lapping. Fact remains that even when MoPNG requested MoF for giving consent to amend the contract, no such authorisation came from MoF. Whether, in such a case, can the Court issue a Mandamus? As noted above, the contention of the respondent is that PSCs are in the nature of a contract agreed to between the two independent contracting parties. It is also mentioned that before the signing of the PSCs, the approval of Cabinet is obtained which reflects that the PSC as submitted to the Cabinet has the approval of one of the contracting parties, namely, Government of India in this case. When it is signed by the other party it means that it has the approval of both the parties. Therefore, a contracting party cannot claim to be oblivious of the provisions of the law or the contents of the contract at the time of signing and, therefore, later on cannot seek retrospective amendment as a matter of right when no such right is conferred under the contract. Even the doctrine of fairness and reasonableness applies only in the exercise of statutory or administrative actions of the State and not in the exercise of contractual obligation and issues arising out of contractual matters are to be decided on the basis of law of contract and not on the basis of the administrative law. No doubt, under certain situations, even in respect of contract with the State relief can be granted under Article 226. We would, thus, be dealing with this aspect in some detail.\n",
      "Paragraph 105: Law in this aspect has developed through catena of judgments of this Court and from the reading of these judgments it would follow that in pure contractual matters extraordinary remedy of writ under Article 226 or Article 32 of the Constitution cannot be invoked. However, in a limited sphere such remedies are available only when the non-Government contracting party is able to demonstrate that its a public law remedy which such party seeks to invoke, in contradistinction to the private law remedy simplicitor under the contract. Some of the case law to bring home this cardinal principle is taken note of hereinafter.\n",
      "Paragraph 106: Significantly, in [?CITATION?] as well, this Court made it clear that if the rights are purely of private character, no mandamus can be issued. Thus, even if the respondent is a 'State', other condition which has to be satisfied for issuance of a writ of mandamus is the public duty. In a matter of private character or purely contractual field, no such public duty element is involved and, thus, mandamus will not lie.\n",
      "Paragraph 107: [?CITATION?] That was the case where Appellate Authority had undertaken construction of dwelling units for people belonging to different income groups and the cost at which such flats were to be allotted to the allottees. However, it was mentioned that the cost stated was only estimated cost and subject to increase or decrease according to rise or fall in the price at the time of completion of property. The authority increased the cost and monthly installment rates which it demanded from the allottees were almost doubled and cost and rates of installments initially stated in the brochure. Respondents/allottees filed writ petition challenging the same and in this context question of maintainability of the writ petition arose. High Court, relying upon the [?CITATION?] allowed the writ petition by observing as under :- \"It has not been disputed that the contesting opposite party is included within the term `other authority' mentioned under Article 12 of the constitution. Therefore, the contesting opposite parties cannot be permitted to act arbitrarily with the principle which meets the test of reason and relevance. Where an authority appears acting unreasonably, this court is not powerless and a writ of mandamus can be issued for performing its duty free from arbitrariness or unreasonableness. In appeal filed by the Authority, this Court, on facts, noted that the respondents had applied for registration only by acceptance of terms and conditions contained in the brochure. Moreover, subsequently letter was written by the Authority about the enhancement of the cost of the houses/flats as well as increase in monthly installments. Rate of yearly interest requesting allottees to give their written acceptance and the respondents except respondent No.4 had sent their written acceptance and it was on the basis of the written acceptance that name of first respondent was included in the draw and he was successful in getting allotment of a particular house. The court observed that respondents were under no obligation to seek allotment of house/ flats even if they had registered themselves. Notwithstanding, the voluntarily registered themselves as applicants only after fully understanding the terms and conditions of the brochure including relating to variance in prices. On the basis of these facts, this Court observed that the aforesaid observations of the High Court relying upon Ramana Dayaram Shetty case were not correct. Thus observed the Court, speaking through Ratnavel Pandian. J.:\n",
      "Paragraph 108: The finding in our view, is not correct in the light of the facts and circumstances of this case because in Ramana Daya Shetty case, there was no concluded contract as in this case. Even conceding that the BDA has the trappings of a state or would be comprehended in 'other authority' for the purpose of Article 12 of the constitution, while determining price of the houses/flats constructed by it and the rate of monthly installments to be paid, the Authority or its agent after entering into the field of ordinary contract acts purely in its executive capacity. Thereafter the relations are no longer governed by the constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines the rights and obligations of the parties inter se. In this sphere they can only claim rights conferred upon them by the contract in the absence of any statutory obligations on the part of the authority (i.e. BDA in this case) in the said contractual field.\n",
      "Paragraph 109: 22\\. There is a line of decisions where the contract entered into between the state and the persons aggrieved is non-statutory and purely contractual and the rights are governed only by the terms of the contract, no writ or order can be issued under Article 226 of the Constitution of India so as to compel the authorities to remedy a breach of contract pure and simple [?CITATION?] In that case respondents took on lease certain land from the Government. Initially, period of lease was 15 years. The lease was to be extended for cultivation and raising tea garden and was subject to condition set out in the Lease Agreement and generally to Assam Land &\n",
      "Paragraph 110: Revenue Regulation and Rules made thereunder. Respondent Company approached appellant seeking permission to cut 7000 cub.ft. of timber. Appellant took the stand that as the timber was required for a particular use which was not within the Grant, full royalty will be payable on timber so cut and removed. Respondent company paid the amount of royalty under protest and filed writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court alleging that upon a true construction of the relevant clauses of the Grant as also proviso to Rule 37 of the Settlement Rules, it was entitled to cut and remove timber without payment of royalty and, therefore, the recovery of royalty being unsupported by law, the appellant was liable to refund the same. A preliminary objection was taken by the appellant to the maintainability of the writ petition on the ground that claim of the respondent flows from terms of lease and such contractual rights and obligations can only he enforced in a civil court. This preliminary objection was overruled by the High Court which proceeded to hear the matter and allowed writ petition of the respondent company. In appeal by the appellant to this Court, the decision of the High Court was reversed holding that writ as not maintainable. Following observations may usefully be quoted:- \"8\\. It is undoubtedly true that High Court can entertain in its extraordinary jurisdiction a petition to issue any of the prerogative writs for any other purpose. But such writ can be issued where there is executive action unsupported by law or even in respect of corporation there is a denial of equality before law or equal protection of law. The Corporation can also file a writ petition for enforcement of a right under a statute.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: As pointed out earlier, the respondent company was merely trying to enforce a contractual obligation. To clear the ground let it be stated that obligation to pay royalty for timber cut and felled and removed is prescribed by the relevant regulations, the validity of regulations is not challenged. Therefore, the demand for royalty is supported by law. What the respondent claims is an exception that in view of a certain term in the indenture of lease, to writ, Clause 2, the appellant is not entitled to demand and collect royalty from the respondent. This is nothing but enforcement of a term of a contract of lease. Hence, the question whether such contractual obligation can be enforced by the High Court in its writ jurisdiction.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: 9\\. Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is complained of, a party complaining of such breach may sue for specific performance of the contract, if contract is capable of being specifically performed, or the party may sue for damages. Such a suit would ordinarily be cognizable by the Civil Court. The High Court in its extraordinary jurisdiction would entertain a petition either for specific performance of contract or for recovering damages. A right to relief flowing from a contract has to be claimed in a Civil Court where a suit for specific performance of contract or for damages could be filed....\".\n",
      "Paragraph 113: The question came up for consideration again in [?CITATION?]. In that case, State of U.P. had issued Government order dated 6.2.1990 whereby appointments of all Government Counsels (Civil, Criminal, Revenue) in all the Districts of the State of U.P. were terminated w.e.f. 28.2.1990, irrespective of the fact whether the term of the incumbents had expired or was subsisting. Validity of this G.D. was challenged by many of these Government Counsels whose appointments were terminated and one of the issues to be determined by the court was as to whether writ petition was maintainable challenging this G.D., as according to the Respondent State the appointment of these Government Counsel was purely contractual and writ petition to enforce the contract was not maintainable. After noticing this argument of the respondents, the Supreme Court formulated the question to be decided in the said case, in the following words:\n",
      "Paragraph 114: The learned Additional Advocate General did not dispute that if Art. 14 of the Constitution of India is attracted to this case all State actions, the impugned circular would be liable to be quashed if it suffers from the vice of arbitrariness. However, his argument is that there is no such vice. In the ultimate analysis, it is the challenge of arbitrariness which the circular must challenge of arbitrariness withstand in order to survive.\n",
      "Paragraph 115: This really is the main point evolved for decision by us in the present case\".\n",
      "Paragraph 116: The Court then examined the nature of appointment of the Government counsel in the Districts with reference to the various legal provisions including legal Remembrance Manual and Section 24 Code of Criminal procedure as well as decision of Supreme Court in which character of engagement of a Government counsel was considered. After analyzing these provisions and case law, the Supreme Court concluded in the following manner, describing the nature of appointment of District Government counsel:\n",
      "Paragraph 117: 17. We are, therefore, unable to accept the argument of the Ld. Addl.\n",
      "Paragraph 118: Advocate General that the appointment of District Government Counsel by the State Government is only a professional engagement like that between a private client and his lawyer, or that it is purely contractual with no public element attaching to it, which may be terminated at any time at the sweet will of the Government excluding judicial review. We have already indicated the presence of public element attached to the 'office' or post of District Government Counsel of every category covered by the impugned circular. This is sufficient to attract Article 14 of the Constitution and bring the question of validity of the impugned circular within the scope of judicial review.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: 18\\. The scope of judicial review permissible in the present case, does not require any elaborate consideration since even the minimum permitted scope of judicial review on the ground of arbitrariness or unreasonableness or irrationality, once Art. 14 is attracted, is sufficient to invalidate the impugned circular as indicated later. We need not, Therefore, deal at length with the scope of judicial review permissible in such cases since several nuances of that ticklish question do not arise for consideration in the present case.\n",
      "Paragraph 120: 19\\. Even otherwise and sans the element so obvious in these appointment and its concomitants viewed as purely contractual matters after the appointment is made, also attract Art. 14 and exclude arbitrariness permitting judicial review of the impugned state action. This aspect is dealt with hereafter.\n",
      "Paragraph 121: 20\\. Even apart from the premises that 'office' or post of D.G.Cs. has a public element which alone is sufficient to attract the power of judicial review for testing validity of the impugned circular on the anvil of Art.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: 14, we are also clearly of the view that this power is available even without that element on the premise that after initial appointment, the matter is purely contractual. Applicability of Art. 14 to all executive actions of the State being settled and for the same reason its applicability at the threshold to the making of a contract in exercise of the executive power being beyond dispute, can it be said that the State can thereafter cast off its personality and exercise unbridled power unfettered by the requirements of Art. 14 in the sphere of contractual matters and claim to be governed therein only by private law, principles applicable to private individuals whose rights flow only from the terms of the contract without anything more ? We have no hesitation in saying that the personality of the State, requiring regulation of its conduct in all spheres by requirements of Art. 14 does not undergo such a radical change after the making of a contract merely, because some contractual rights accrue to the other party in addition. It is not as if the requirements of Art. 14 and contractual obligations are alien concepts, which cannot co- exist.\n",
      "Paragraph 123: 21\\. The preamble of the Constitution of India resolves to secure to all its citizens Justice, social economic and political: and Equality of status and opportunity. Every State action must be aimed at achieving this goal. Part IV of the Constitution contains 'Directive principles of State Policy' which are fundamental in the governance of the country and are aimed at securing social and economic freedoms by appropriate State action which is complementary to individual fundamental rights guaranteed in part III for protection against excesses of State action, to realise the vision in the preamble. This being the philosophy of the constitution, can it be said that it contemplates exclusion of Art. 14 non arbitrariness which is basic to rule of law from State actions is contractual field when all actions of the State are meant fore public good and expected to be fair and just ? we have no doubt that the Constitution does not envisage or permit unfairness or unreasonableness in State actions in any sphere of its activity contrary to the professed ideals in the preamble. In our opinion, it would be alien to the Constitutional scheme to accept the argument of exclusion of Art. 14 in contractual matters. The scope and permissible grounds of judicial review in such matters and the relief which may be available are different matters but that does not justify the view of its total exclusion. This is more so when the modern t rend is also to examine the unreasonableness of a term in such contractual where the bargaining power is unequal so that these are not negotiated contracts but standard from contracts between unequal.\n",
      "Paragraph 124: 22\\. There is an obvious difference in the contracts between private parties and contracts to which the State is a party. Private parties are concerned only with their personal interest whereas the State while exercising its powers and discharging its functions, acts indubitably, as is expected of it for public good and in public interest. The impact of every State action is also on public interest. This factor alone is sufficient to import at least the minimum requirements of public law obligations and impress with this character the contracts made by the State or its instrumentality. It is a different mater that the scope of judicial review in respect of disputes scope of judicial review in respect of disputes falling within the domain of contractual obligations may be more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be relegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies provided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes. However, to the extent, challenge is made on the ground of violation of Art. 14 by alleging that the impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the fact that the dispute also falls within the domain of contractual obligations would not relieve the State of its obligation to comply with the basic requirements of Art. 14. To this extent, the obligation is of a public character invariably in every case irrespective of there being any other right or obligation in addition thereto. An additional contractual obligation cannot divest the claimant of the guarantee under Art. 14 of non- arbitrariness at the hands of the State in any of its actions.\n",
      "Paragraph 125: xx xx xx\n",
      "Paragraph 126: 34\\. In our opinion, the wide sweep of Art. 14 undoubtedly takes within its fold the impugned circular issued by the State of U.P. in exercise of its executive power, irrespective of the precise nature of appointment of the Government counsel in the districts and the other rights, contractual or statutory, which the appointees may have. It is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground that independent of any statutory right, available to the appointments, and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment, the impugned circular, issued in exercise of the executive power of the State, must satisfy Art. 14 of the Constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary, it must be struck down. However, we have referred to certain provisions relating to initial appointment, termination or renewal of tenure to indicate that the action is controlled at least by settled guidelines, followed by the State of U.P. for a long time. This too is relevant for deciding the question of arbitrariness alleged in the present case\"\n",
      "Paragraph 127: Similarly, in [?CITATION?], this Court reiterated the principles that if the matter is governed by a contract, the writ petition is not maintainable since it is a public law remedy and is not available in private law field, for example, where the matter is governed by a non-statutory contract.\n",
      "Paragraph 128: At this stage, we would like to discuss at length the judgment of this Court in ABL International Ltd. (supra), on which strong reliance is placed upon by the counsel for both the parties. In that case, various earlier judgments right from the year 1954 were taken note of. One such judgment which the Department in support of their case had referred to was the decision of Apex Court in [?CITATION?] wherein the Court had held that ordinarily in matter relating to contractual obligations, the Court would not examine it unless the action has some public law character attached to it. The following passage from the said judgment was relied upon by the respondents:\n",
      "Paragraph 129: If the action of the State is related to contractual obligations or obligations arising out of the tort, the court may not ordinarily examine it unless the action has some public law character attached to it. Broadly speaking, the court will examine actions of State if they pertain to the public law domain and refrain from examining them if they pertain to the private law field. The difficulty will lie in demarcating the frontier between the public law domain and the private law field. It is impossible to draw the line with precision and we do not want to attempt it. The question must be decided in each case with reference to the particular action, the activity in which the State or the instrumentality of the State is engaged when performing the action, the public law or private law character of the action and a host of other relevant circumstances. When the State or an instrumentality of the State ventures into the corporate world and purchases the shares of a company, it assumes to itself the ordinary role of a shareholder, and dons the robes of a shareholder, with all the rights available to such a shareholder. There is no reason why the State as a shareholder should be expected to state its reasons when it seeks to change the management, by a resolution of the company, like any other shareholder.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 130: This Court dealt with this judgment in the following manner:\n",
      "Paragraph 131: We do not think Court in the above case has, in any manner, departed from the view expressed in the earlier judgments in the case cited hereinabove.\n",
      "Paragraph 132: This Court in the case of Life Insurance Corporation of India (Supra) proceeded on the facts of that case and held that a relief by way of a writ petition may not ordinarily be an appropriate remedy. This judgment does not lay down that as a rule in matters of contract the court's jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution is ousted. On the contrary, the use of the words \"court may not ordinarily examine it unless the action has some public law character attached to it\" itself indicates that in a given case, on the existence of the required factual matrix a remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution will be available.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 133: Insofar as the argument of the respondents in the said case that writ petition on contractual matter was not maintainable unless it is shown that the authority performs a public function or discharges a public duty, is concerned, it was answered in the following manner:\n",
      "Paragraph 134: 22. We do not think the above judgment in VST Industries Ltd. (supra) supports the argument of the learned counsel on the question of maintainability of the present writ petition. It is to be noted that VST Industries Ltd. against whom the writ petition was filed was not a State or an instrumentality of a State as contemplated under Article 12 of the Constitution, hence, in the normal course, no writ could have been issued against the said industry. But it was the contention of the writ petitioner in that case that the said industry was obligated under the concerned statute to perform certain public functions, failure to do so would give rise to a complaint under Article 226 against a private body. While considering such argument, this Court held that when an authority has to perform a public function or a public duty if there is a failure a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is maintainable. In the instant case, as to the fact that the respondent is an instrumentality of a State, there is no dispute but the question is: was first respondent discharging a public duty or a public function while repudiating the claim of the appellants arising out of a contract ? Answer to this question, in our opinion, is found in the judgment of this Court in the case of [?CITATION?] wherein this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 135: The impact of every State action is also on public interest. It is really the nature of its personality as State which is significant and must characterize all its actions, in whatever field, and not the nature of function, contractual or otherwise which is decisive of the nature of scrutiny permitted for examining the validity of its act. The requirement of Article 14 being the duty to act fairly, justly and reasonably, there is nothing which militates against the concept of requiring the State always to so act, even in contractual matters.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 136: 23\\. It is clear from the above observations of this Court, once State or an instrumentality of State is a party to the contract, it has an obligation in law to act fairly, justly and reasonably which is the requirement of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, if by the impugned repudiation of the claim of the appellants the first respondent as an instrumentality of the State has acted in contravention of the above said requirement of Article 14 then we have no hesitation that a writ court can issue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary actions of the first respondent.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 137: The Court thereafter summarized the legal position in the following manner:\n",
      "Paragraph 138: 27. From the above discussion of ours, following legal principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition :- (a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against a State or an instrumentality of a State arising out of a contractual obligation is maintainable.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: (b) Merely because some disputed questions of facts arise for consideration, same cannot be a ground to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all cases as a matter of rule.\n",
      "Paragraph 140: (c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief of monetary claim is also maintainable.\n",
      "Paragraph 141: 28\\. However, while entertaining an objection as to the maintainability of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the court should bear in mind the fact that the power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provisions of the Constitution. The High Court having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. The Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions in the exercise of this power [?CITATION?] And this plenary right of the High Court to issue a prerogative writ will not normally be exercised by the Court to the exclusion of other available remedies unless such action of the State or its instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional mandate of Article 14 or for other valid and legitimate reasons, for which the court thinks it necessary to exercise the said jurisdiction.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 142: The position thus summarized in the aforesaid principles has to be understood in the context of discussion that preceded which we have pointed out above. As per this, no doubt, there is no absolute bar to the maintainability of the writ petition even in contractual matters or where there are disputed questions of fact or even when monetary claim is raised.\n",
      "Paragraph 143: At the same time, discretion lies with the High Court which under certain circumstances, can refuse to exercise. It also follows that under the following circumstances, 'normally', the Court would not exercise such a discretion:\n",
      "Paragraph 144: (a) the Court may not examine the issue unless the action has some public law character attached to it.\n",
      "Paragraph 145: (b) Whenever a particular mode of settlement of dispute is provided in the contract, the High Court would refuse to exercise its discretion under Article 226 of the Constitution and relegate the party to the said made of settlement, particularly when settlement of disputes is to be resorted to through the means of arbitration.\n",
      "Paragraph 146: (c) If there are very serious disputed questions of fact which are of complex nature and require oral evidence for their determination.\n",
      "Paragraph 147: (d) Money claims per se particularly arising out of contractual obligations are normally not to be entertained except in exceptional circumstances.\n",
      "Paragraph 148: Further legal position which emerges from various judgments of this Court dealing with different situations/aspects relating to the contracts entered into by the State/public Authority with private parties, can be summarized as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 149: (i) At the stage of entering into a contract, the State acts purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the obligations of fairness.\n",
      "Paragraph 150: (ii) State in its executive capacity, even in the contractual field, is under obligation to act fairly and cannot practice some discriminations.\n",
      "Paragraph 151: (iii) Even in cases where question is of choice or consideration of competing claims before entering into the field of contract, facts have to be investigated and found before the question of a violation of Article 14 could arise. If those facts are disputed and require assessment of evidence the correctness of which can only be tested satisfactorily by taking detailed evidence, Involving examination and cross- examination of witnesses, the case could not be conveniently or satisfactorily decided in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. In such cases court can direct the aggrieved party to resort to alternate remedy of civil suit etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 152: (iv) Writ jurisdiction of High Court under Article 226 was not intended to facilitate avoidance of obligation voluntarily incurred.\n",
      "Paragraph 153: (v) Writ petition was not maintainable to avoid contractual obligation.\n",
      "Paragraph 154: Occurrence of commercial difficulty, inconvenience or hardship in performance of the conditions agreed to in the contract can provide no justification in not complying with the terms of contract which the parties had accepted with open eyes. It cannot ever be that a licensee can work out the license if he finds it profitable to do so: and he can challenge the conditions under which he agreed to take the license, if he finds it commercially inexpedient to conduct his business.\n",
      "Paragraph 155: (vi) Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is complained of, the party complaining of such breach may sue for specific performance of the contract, if contract is capable of being specifically performed.\n",
      "Paragraph 156: Otherwise, the party may sue for damages.\n",
      "Paragraph 157: (vii) Writ can be issued where there is executive action unsupported by law or even in respect of a corporation there is denial of equality before law or equal protection of law or if can be shown that action of the public authorities was without giving any hearing and violation of principles of natural justice after holding that action could not have been taken without observing principles of natural justice.\n",
      "Paragraph 158: (viii) If the contract between private party and the State/instrumentality and/or agency of State is under the realm of a private law and there is no element of public law, the normal course for the aggrieved party, is to invoke the remedies provided under ordinary civil law rather than approaching the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitutional of India and invoking its extraordinary jurisdiction.\n",
      "Paragraph 159: (ix) The distinction between public law and private law element in the contract with State is getting blurred. However, it has not been totally obliterated and where the matter falls purely in private field of contract.\n",
      "Paragraph 160: This Court has maintained the position that writ petition is not maintainable. Dichotomy between public law and private law, rights and remedies would depend on the factual matrix of each case and the distinction between public law remedies and private law, field cannot be demarcated with precision. In fact, each case has to be examined, on its facts whether the contractual relations between the parties bear insignia of public element. Once on the facts of a particular case it is found that nature of the activity or controversy involves public law element, then the matter can be examined by the High Court in writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to see whether action of the State and/or instrumentality or agency of the State is fair, just and equitable or that relevant factors are taken into consideration and irrelevant factors have not gone into the decision making process or that the decision is not arbitrary.\n",
      "Paragraph 161: (x) Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirements of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non-arbitrariness.\n",
      "Paragraph 162: (xi) The scope of judicial review in respect of disputes falling within the domain of contractual obligations may be more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be relegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies provided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes.\n",
      "Paragraph 163: Keeping in mind the aforesaid principles and after considering the arguments of respective parties, we are of the view that on the facts of the present case, it is not a fit case where the High Court should have exercised discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 164: First, the matter is in the realm of pure contract. It is not a case where any statutory contract is awarded.\n",
      "Paragraph 165: As pointed out earlier as well, the contract in question was signed after the approval of Cabinet was obtained. In the said contract, there was no clause pertaining to Section 42 of the Act. The appellant is presumed to have knowledge of the legal provision, namely, in the absence of such a clause, special allowances under Section 42 would impermissible. Still it signed the contract without such a clause, with open eyes. No doubt, the appellant claimed these deductions in its income tax returns and it was even allowed these deductions by the Income Tax Authorities. Further, no doubt, on this premise, it shared the profits with the Government as well.\n",
      "Paragraph 166: However, this conduct of the appellant or even the respondents, was outside the scope of the contract and that by itself may not give any right to the appellant to claim a relief in the nature of Mandamus to direct the Government to incorporate such a clause in the contract, in the face of the specific provisions in the contract to the contrary as noted above, particularly, Article 32 thereof. It was purely a contractual matter with no element of public law involved thereunder.\n",
      "Paragraph 167: Having considered the matter in the aforesaid prospective, we come to the irresistible conclusion that the appellant is not entitled to the relief claimed. Though it may be somewhat harsh on the appellant when it availed the benefit of Section 42 for few years and acted on the understanding that such a benefit would be given to it, but we have no option but to hold that PSCs did not provide for this benefit to be given to the appellant and the contract can be amended only if both the parties agree to do so, and not otherwise. Therefore, we are constrained to dismiss the appeal for the reasons given above.\n",
      "Paragraph 168: There shall, however, be no orders as to costs. \n"

      "Paragraph 1: KAPADIA, J.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: This is an appeal filed by All India Federation of Tax Practitioners against the Division Bench judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 22.2.2001 in Writ Petition No. 142/99 upholding the legislative competence of Parliament to levy service tax vide Finance Act, 1994 and Finance Act, 1998\\. According to the impugned judgment, service tax falls in Entry 97, List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 2\\. The question which arises for determination in this civil appeal concerns the constitutional status of the levy of service tax and the legislative competence of Parliament to impose service tax under Article 246(1) read with Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The issue arising in this appeal questions the competence of Parliament to levy service tax on practising chartered accountants and architects having regard to Entry 60 List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and Article 276 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: Background Facts\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 3\\. On 1.6.1998 Finance Bill, 1998 was introduced in Parliament. Clause 119 of the Notes sought to substitute Sections 65, 66 and 68 and amend Section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994 relating to service tax so as to levy a tax on services rendered by a practising chartered accountant, cost accountant and architect to a client in professional capacity at the rate of five per cent of the amount charged to the client. On 3.6.1998, Bombay Chartered Accountants Association made a representation to the Central Government objecting to the aforestated Bill. On 1.8.1998 the Finance Bill was however passed and the Finance (No. [2) Act, 1998] received the assent of the President of India. The Act came into force with effect from 1.4.1998. On 7.10.1998, Union of India issued Notification No. 57/98 inter alia exempting taxable services other than accounting and auditing. On 16.10.1998, Union of India issued another Notification No. 59/98 inter alia reducing the scope of the exemption. On 20.1.1999, Writ Petition No.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 142/99 was filed by the Federation in the Bombay High Court challenging the validity of the levy of service tax. By the impugned judgment dated 22.2.2001 the Bombay High Court rejected the writ petition and upheld the legislative competence of Parliament to levy service tax.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: Reason for Imposition of Service Tax\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 4\\. Service tax is an indirect tax levied on certain services provided by certain categories of persons including companies, association, firms, body of individuals etc.. Service sector contributes about 64% to the GDP.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: \u0013Services\u0014 constitute heterogeneous spectrum of economic activities. Today services cover wide range of activities such as management, banking, insurance, hospitality, consultancy, communication, administration, entertainment, research and development activities forming part of retailing sector. Service sector is today occupying the centre stage of the Indian economy. It has become an Industry by itself. In the contemporary world, development of service sector has become synonymous with the advancement of the economy. Economics hold the view that there is no distinction between the consumption of goods and consumption of services as both satisfy the human needs.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 5\\. In late seventies, Government of India initiated an exercise to explore alternative revenue sources due to resource constraints. The primary sources of revenue are direct and indirect taxes. Central excise duty is a tax on the goods produced in India whereas customs duty is the tax on imports. The word \u0013goods\u0014 has to be understood in contradistinction to the word \u0013services\u0014. Customs and excise duty constitute two major sources of indirect taxes in India. Both are consumption specific in the sense that they do not constitute a charge on the business but on the client. However, by 1994, Government of India found revenue receipts from customs and excise on the decline due to W.T.O. commitments and due to rationalization of duties on commodities. Therefore, in the year 1994-95, the then Union Finance Minister introduced the new concept of \u0013service tax\u0014 by imposing tax on services of telephones, non- life insurance and stock-brokers. That list has increased since then. Knowledge economy has made \u0013services\u0014 an important revenue-earner.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 6\\. At this stage, we may refer to the concept of \u0013Value Added Tax\u0014 (VAT), which is a general tax that applies, in principle, to all commercial activities involving production of goods and provision of services. VAT is a consumption tax as it is borne by the consumer.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 7\\. In the light of what is stated above, it is clear that Service Tax is a VAT which in turn is destination based consumption tax in the sense that it is on commercial activities and is not a charge on the business but on the consumer and it would, logically, be leviable only on services provided within the country. Service tax is a value added tax.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 8\\. As stated above, service tax is VAT. Just as excise duty is a tax on value addition on goods, service tax is on value additioin by rendition of services. Therefore, for our understanding, broadly \u0013services\u0014 fall into two categories, namely, property based services and performance based services.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: Property based services cover service providers such as architects, interior designers, real estate agents, construction services, mandapwalas etc..\n",
      "Paragraph 15: Performance based services are services provided by service providers like stock-brokers, practising chartered accountants, practising cost accountants, security agencies, tour operators, event managers, travel agents etc..\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 9\\. Government of India in order to tap new areas of taxation and to identify the hidden one appointed Tax Reforms Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. Chelliah in August, 1991. The recommendations made by the Committee were accepted and the Service Tax was introduced in the Budget for 1994-95 through the Finance Act, 1994. Under the said enactment, Service Tax is the tax on notified services provided or to be provided. After its introduction, the constitutional validity of the services taxed by the Central Government was challenged before the Constitution Bench of this Court which took the view that the Central Government derived its authority from Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution for levying tax on services provided.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: 10\\. To provide necessary legal backup, the Government introduced a new Article 268A in the Constitution in the year 2003 by Constitution (Eighty- eighth Amendment) Act, 2003, which provides that taxes on services shall be charged by Union of India and shall be appropriated by Union of India and the States. A new Entry 92C was also introduced in the Union List for the levy of taxes on services. Section 65(16) of the Finance Act, 1994 provided for definition of \u0013taxable service\u0014 to mean any service provided by stock-broker, telegraph authority, and by insurer. Section 67 provided for valuation of taxable service based on gross receipts. In cases where value of taxable service could not be decided then the cost of providing the service constituted the basis of the assessable value of taxable service.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: 11\\. At this stage, we may state that the above discussion shows that what was the economic concept, namely, that there is no distinction between consumption of goods and consumption of services is translated into a legal principle of taxation by the aforestated Finance Acts of 1994 and 1998.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: Scheme of the Finance Act, 1994 and Finance Act, 1998\n",
      "Paragraph 20: 12\\. Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 referred to Service Tax. It defined \u0013assessee\u0014 to mean a person responsible for collecting the service tax. Under the Act, \u0013service tax\u0014 was defined to mean tax chargeable under Chapter V.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: Under the Act, \u0013taxable service\u0014 was defined to mean any service provided by a stock-broker to an investor in connection with the sale or purchase of securities listed on a recognized stock exchange; services rendered to a subscriber by the telegraph authority; and services rendered by an insurer to a policy holder. Under the Act, it was clarified that words and expressions not defined in Chapter V but used therein shall bear the same meaning as given in the Central Excise Act, 1944. Section 66 stated that service tax shall be levied at the rate of five per cent of the value of taxable services provided to any person by the service provider who was responsible for collecting the service tax. It was similar to Section 3 of Central Excise Act, 1944. Section 67 dealt with valuation of taxable services. Section 68 dealt with collection and recovery of service tax. Section 71 dealt with assessment. Section 72 dealt with best judgment assessment. Section 73 dealt with value of taxable services escaping assessment. Section 83 inter alia stated that Section 9C, 9D, 11B etc. of the Central Excise Act shall apply also to collection and recovery of service tax. Further, it may be stated that the administration of service tax is given to the authorities under the Central Excise Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 13\\. Broadly, to the same effect, is the Finance Act of 1998. The said Act has increased the list of notified services so as to include advertising agencies, travel agencies, architects, caterers, clearing and forwarding agents, credit rating agencies, customs house agents, practising chartered accountants, practising cost accountants, real estate agents, security agencies etc.. We are concerned in this case with the services provided by architects, chartered accountants and cost accountants covered by the Finance Act, 1998.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: Relevant Provisions of the Constitution of India 14\\. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of India are as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 24: \u0013Article 246.

      "Paragraph 39: \u001338. Electricity.\u0014 Arguments:\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 15\\. The basic argument advanced on behalf of the appellant-Federation before us was on Entry 60 of List II of the Seventh Schedule reproduced above. The said Entry refers to taxes on professions, trades callings and employments. The argument advanced by Shri Shyam Divan, learned counsel on behalf of the appellant, was that every entry in the Lists in the Seventh Schedule represents a field of legislation. Therefore, it should be read in a broad sense. The appellant did not dispute before us the proposition that the service tax was a tax on service and that it was not a tax on the service providers. The basic contention of the appellant was that the State Legislature alone has an absolute jurisdiction and legislative competence to levy service tax. It was submitted that service tax was a tax on profession. It was submitted that service tax fell within the ambit of Entry 60 of List II. It was submitted that the word profession in the said Entry was not limited by any restriction/qualification and, therefore, it must be read with the widest possible sense. It was submitted that the word \u0013profession\u0014 has been defined in Black\u0012s Law dictionary to mean a vocation requiring advance education and training. It was submitted that the word \u0013profession\u0014 has been defined in the English dictionary by Collins to mean an \u0013occupation\u0014 requiring special training in the liberal arts or sciences, especially one of the three learned professions, law, theology, or medicine. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that there was no difference between tax on profession and tax on services. According to the learned counsel, the word \u0011profession\u0012 in Entry 60 List II was synonymous with the word \u0011service\u0012 and, therefore, tax on profession would include tax on service, which tax could be levied only by the State Legislature. It was submitted that there cannot be a profession without service. It was submitted that service rendered by a chartered accountant/cost accountant to his client is the service rendered as a professional. It was urged on behalf of the appellant that it was not the case of the appellant that services cannot be taxed. The only argument advanced on behalf of the appellant was that the tax on profession was the State Entry and, therefore, Entry 97 of List I cannot be invoked and that Parliament had no legislative competence to levy service tax. It was submitted that under the Finance Acts, taxability was limited to rendition of professional services and, therefore, tax on profession under Entry 60 of List II would include tax on service. In short, according to the learned counsel, the word \u0011profession\u0012 in Entry 60 of List II was nothing but service and, therefore, levy of service tax came within the competence of State Legislature alone. Placing reliance on Article 276(1), learned counsel on behalf of the appellants submitted that the words used in Article 276(1), namely, no law of the State Legislature relating to taxes in respect of professions, callings etc. were words of widest amplitudes and, therefore, the word \u0013profession\u0014 would cover every aspect connected with it; that the word \u0013service\u0014 was not an aspect of the word \u0013profession\u0014 it was in fact synonymous to each other; that they were inseparable and, therefore, tax on services could be levied only by State Legislature. Learned counsel urged that the expression \u0013relating to\u0014 and the expression \u0013in respect of\u0014 are the two expressions which have linkage to levy of taxes on profession, calling etc. and to the words profession, trade, calling etc. in Article 276(1) and, therefore, if the aforestated two expressions are read in their proper context, they indicate the intention of the Constitution framers in incorporating taxes on profession under a separate Legislative Head. According to the learned counsel, therefore, this Court must give a wide interpretation to the words taxes on professions, trades, callings etc. Learned counsel submitted that the words in respect of professions, trades, callings etc. in Article 276(1) indicate amplitude and the wide field open to the State Legislature to make laws imposing taxes on professions, trades, callings etc.. It was urged that the above two expressions, namely, \u0011relating to\u0012 and \u0011in respect of \u0011 are known in law as words of widest amplitude and if the significance of the said two expressions is kept in mind, then it becomes clear that the Constitution framers intended the State Legislature alone to be competent to impose taxes on professions, trades, callings and employments and that they did not intend to give such a power to Parliament. Learned counsel submitted that if due weightage is given to the aforestated two expressions then the word \u0011profession\u0012 in Article 276(1) and Entry 60 of List II would cover every aspect of the concept of professions, trades, callings and employments. It was submitted that profession cannot exist without service as service is the core of profession. Learned counsel submitted that if the above two expressions in Article 276(1) are given due weightage then there would be no difference between the words \u0013profession\u0014 and \u0013service\u0014; that these two words would be interchangeable and if used interchangeably, it is clear that the State Legislature alone has the absolute competence to levy tax on services as there was no difference between the two words, namely, \u0013service\u0014 and \u0013profession\u0014. Reliance was also placed on Article 276(3) in support of the contention that the Constitution itself had made a dichotomy between taxes on professions, trades, callings and employments on one hand and taxes on incomes arising out of professions, trades, callings and employments on the other and that the said dichotomy between tax on profession (service) vis-a- vis the tax on income arising out of professions, trades, callings etc. itself indicates that a separate field is demarcated for Parliament to enact laws imposing tax on incomes arising out of professions and, at the same time, the State Legislature alone shall have the competence to impose tax on professions, trades, callings etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 16\\. Shri V. Shekhar, learned senior counsel for the Department, placing reliance on judgments impugned of various High Courts, submitted that \u0013service tax\u0014 was a tax on activities undertaken for consideration; that it was a tax on services and not on the service-provider; that the tax on profession was essentially a tax on the professional and, therefore, Parliament had the legislative competence to levy service tax under Entry 97 of List I. It was further submitted that with the Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003 by which Entry 92C is inserted, the controversy is closed and, therefore, there is no question of going behind the said entry which has accepted the validity of the impugned judgments by Constitutional Amendments.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: Findings:\n",
      "Paragraph 43: (i) Meaning of \u0013Service Tax\u0014:\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 17\\. As stated above, the source of the concept of service tax lies in economics. It is an economic concept. It has evolved on account of Service Industry becoming a major contributor to the GDP of an economy, particularly knowledge-based economy. With the enactment of Finance Act, 1994, the Central Government derived its authority from the residuary Entry 97 of the Union List for levying tax on services. The legal backup was further provided by the introduction of Article 268A in the Constitution vide Constitution (Eighty- eighth Amendment) Act, 2003 which stated that taxes on services shall be charged by the Central Government and appropriated between the Union Government and the States. Simultaneously, a new Entry 92C was also introduced in the Union List for the levy of service tax. As stated above, as an economic concept, there is no distinction between the consumption of goods and consumption of services as both satisfy human needs. It is this economic concept based on the legal principle of equivalence which now stands incorporated in the Constitution vide Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003. Further, it is important to note, that \u0013service tax\u0014 is a value added tax which in turn is a general tax which applies to all commercial activities involving production of goods and provision of services. Moreover, VAT is a consumption tax as it is borne by the client.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 18\\. In [?CITATION?] we get a clue of an important principle, namely, \u0013principle of equivalence\u0014. In that judgment, this Court was required to explain the words \u0013excisable goods\u0014 and \u0013produced or manufactured\u0014. It was held by this Court that the expression \u0013excisable goods\u0014 has been defined in Section 2 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 to mean goods specified in the Schedule. It was held that the object for having a schedule in the Act was to fix rates under different entries including residuary entry. At this stage, we may say that the object of the Finance Act is also to fix rates of duty under different entries. However, the question which arose before this Court in Moti Laminates (supra) was the meaning of the word \u0013goods\u0014 in Central Excise Act, 1944. This Court noticed that Section 3 of the 1944 Act levied duty on all excisable goods mentioned in the schedule provided they are produced and manufactured, therefore, this Court laid down the test that where goods are specified in the schedule they are excisable goods but whether such goods can be subjected to duty would depend on whether they were produced or manufactured by the assessee.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: This Court further explained that the expression \u0013produced or manufactured\u0014 would mean that the goods produced must satisfy the test of saleability/marketability. The reason being that the duty under the 1944 Act is on manufacture/production but the manufacture/production is intended for taking such goods to the market for sale. It was observed that the obvious reason for levying excise duty linked with production or manufacture is that the goods so produced must be a distinct commodity known in the market.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: We quote hereinbelow para 7 of the said judgment, which is as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 48: \u0013The duty of excise being on production and manufacture which means bringing out a new commodity, it is implicit that such goods must be useable, moveable, saleable and marketable. The duty is on manufacture or production but the production or manufacture is carried on for taking such goods to the market for sale. The obvious rationale for levying excise duty linking it with production or manufacture is that the goods so produced must be a distinct commodity known as such in common parlance or to the commercial community for purposes of buying and selling. Since the solution that was produced could not be used as such without any further processing or application of heat or pressure, it could not be considered as goods on which any excise duty could be levied.\u0014 Therefore, even if an item is manufactured or produced, it will not fall in the concept of goods till the test of marketability is satisfied. In the case of Moti Laminates (supra) the \u0011solution\u0012 was an intermediate product produced in the course of manufacture of laminated sheets. It had a short shelf life. It was not marketable, therefore, this Court took the view that the solution was not \u0013goods\u0014 and, therefore, not dutiable.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: 19\\. The importance of the above judgment of this Court is twofold.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: Firstly, applying the principle of equivalence, there is no difference between production or manufacture of saleable goods and production of marketable/saleable services in the form of an activity undertaken by the service provider for consideration, which correspondingly stands consumed by the service receiver. It is this principle of equivalence which is in-built into the concept of service tax, which has received legal support in the form of Finance Act, 1994. To give an illustration, an Event Manager (professional) undertakes an activity, namely, of organizing shows. He belongs to the profession of Event Manager. As long as he is in the business or calling or profession of an Event Manager, he is liable to pay the tax on profession, calling or trade under Entry 60 of List II. However, that tax under Entry 60 of List II will not cover his activity of organizing shows for consideration which provide entertainment to the connoisseurs. For each show he plans and creates based on his skill, experience and training. In each show he undertakes an activity which is commercial and which he places before his audience for its consumption. The tax on service is levied for each show. This situation is very similar to a situation where goods are manufacture or produced with the intention of being cleared for home consumption under the Central Excise Act, 1944. This is how the principle of equivalence equates consumption of goods with consumption of services as both satisfy the human needs. In the case of Internet Service Provider, service tax is leviable for on-line information and database provided by web sites. But no service tax is leviable on E-commerce as there is no Database Access.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 20\\. On the basis of the above discussion, it is clear that service tax is VAT which in turn is both a general tax as well as destination based consumption tax leviable on services provided within the country.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: (ii) Object of enacting the Finance Act:\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 21\\. Finance Act is passed every year to fix the rate of tax. This is the primary object for enacting the Finance Act. But it does not mean that a new distinct charge cannot be introduced by the Finance Act. For example, what is not \u0013income\u0014 under the Income Tax Act (\u0013IT Act\u0014) can be made income by the Finance Act. This is, however, subject to the Finance Act complying with the Constitutional limitations. Additional tax revenue can be collected either by increasing the rate or by levy of a fresh charge. All levies through the medium of the Finance Act may either enhance the rate or levy a fresh charge. The Finance Act can also make an extensive modification in an Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: 22\\. In the case of [?CITATION?] this Court held that the IT Act, 1961 and the annual Finance Acts are enacted by Parliament in exercise of the power conferred by Article 246(1) read with Entry 82 of List I. It was further held that though it was unconventional for Parliament to amend the taxing statute by incorporating the amending provision in an Act of a different pith and substance, such course would not be unconstitutional. It was held that though the IT Act, 1961 was a permanent Act while Finance Acts are passed every year to prescribe the rates at which the tax has been charged under the IT Act, 1961 still it would not mean that a new and distinct charge cannot be introduced under the Finance Act. Therefore, what is not income under the IT Act, 1961 can be made \u0013income\u0014 by a Finance Act. Similarly an exemption granted by the IT Act can be withdrawn by the Finance Act. Similarly, subject to Constitutional limitations, additional tax revenue could be collected by enhancement of the rate of tax or by the levy of a fresh charge vide the Finance Act. Parliament, through the medium of Finance Act, may do what the amendment to the IT Act, 1961 by a separate Amendment Act, can do. It was further held that, the Finance Acts, though annual Acts, are not necessarily temporary Acts as they may contain provisions of a general character which are of permanent operation. Thus, Parliament is competent to introduce a charging provision in a Finance Act. In the said judgment, it had been further held that even an additional charge (surcharge) can be levied by Finance Act for the purposes of the Union.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: 23\\. The aforestated judgment was in the context of the IT Act, 1961.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: However, the ratio of that judgment would apply equally to the Finance Acts enacted annually for enhancement of the rate of excise duty by levy of a fresh charge under that Act. Applying the test laid down in the aforestated judgment of this Court, we hold that a new charge by way of service tax or tax on service came to be levied statutorily by the said Finance Act, 1994, which has subsequently attained Constitutional status by virtue of the Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: (iii) Interpretation of Taxing Entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution:\n",
      "Paragraph 58: 24\\. Constitutional law, like taxing law, essentially concerns concepts and principles.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 25\\. In the present case, it has been vehemently urged on behalf of the appellant that legislative Entries in the Seventh Schedule are legislative heads/fields and, therefore, they should be given widest interpretation. There is no dispute regarding the said proposition. However, there are two groups of entries in each of the three Lists in the Seventh Schedule. In List I, Entries 1 to 81 refer to several matters over which Parliament has authority to legislate. But Entries 82 to 92 enumerates the taxes which could be imposed by a law of Parliament. An examination of these two groups of entries shows that while the main subject of legislation finds place in the first group, a tax in relation thereto is separately mentioned in the second group. For example, Entry 22 in List I refers to \u0013Railways\u0014 whereas Entry 89 refers to \u0013Terminal taxes on goods or passengers, carried by railway\u0014. If Entry 22 is construed as involving taxes to be imposed, then Entry 89 would be superfluous.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: Similarly, Entry 41 of List I refers to \u0013Trade and commerce with foreign countries; import and export across customs frontiers\u0014, however, Entry 83 refers to \u0013Duties of customs including export duties\u0014. If Entry 41 of List I, which refers to trade and commerce with foreign countries and which refers to import and export, is to be interpreted as including duties of customs under that Entry, then Entry 83 would be rendered superfluous. Similarly, Entries 43 and 44 of List I relate to incorporation, regulation and winding up of corporations whereas Entry 85 provides for \u0013Corporation tax\u0014. If Entries 43 and 44 are to cover taxes then Entry 85 would be rendered superfluous.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 26\\. Turning to List II, Entries 1 to 44 form one group mentioning the \u0013subjects\u0014 on which States could legislate. Entries 45 to 63 in that List form another group, and they deal in with taxes. At the relevant time, Entry 18 referred to \u0013Lands\u0014 whereas Entry 45 referred to \u0013Land Revenue\u0014. If land revenue was to fall under Entry 18 then Entry 45 would be rendered superfluous. The above analysis is not exhaustive. However, the above analysis shows that taxation is not intended to be compromised in the main subject in which an extended construction can be given as that test cannot be applied to taxation. Taxing entries are distinct entries. This distinction between the abovementioned two groups of entries is also manifest in the language of Article 248 clauses (1) and (2) as also in the language of Entry 97 in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. [See [?CITATION?]]\n",
      "Paragraph 62: 27\\. The above distinction between the group of general entries and the group of taxing entries to the Lists in the Seventh Schedule has also been highlighted in the case of [?CITATION?] in which this Court took the view that enactment of the Medicinal Act, 1955 by Parliament under Entry 84 List I does not prevent the State Legislature from making a law under Entry 8 List II as Entry 8 was a general entry whereas Entry 84 List I was a taxing entry. This distinction has been brought to light in another judgment of this Court to which one of us, Kapadia, J., was a party in the case of [?CITATION?], which is quoted hereinbelow:\n",
      "Paragraph 63: \u001328. Before concluding, we may point out that in the case of [?CITATION?] this Court has taken the view, which we have taken hereinabove. In that case, this Court held, that, by enactment of Medicinal Act, 1955 by Parliament under Entry 84 List-I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution or by the framing of rules by the Central Government thereunder for recovery of excise duty on manufacture of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol, a State Legislature is not prevented from making a law under Entry 8 List II with respect to intoxicating liquor or a law under Entry 51 List II levying excise duties on alcoholic liquors for human consumption. In that case it was held that the Abkari Act of Kerala is relatable to the State's power to make a law under Entry 8 and Entry 51 List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. There is a difference between the word \"on\" and the expression \"with respect to\". When we refer to levy on excise duty under Entry 84 List I, we emphasize the word \"on\". On the other hand, when we refer to Entry 8 List II, which is a general entry, relating to \"intoxicating liquor\", we refer to a wider activity. The words \"in respect of or the words \"with respect to\" used in the aforestated judgment in the context of Entry 8 List II bring out the above difference.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: Entry 8 List-II is an entry on general subject unlike Entry 84 List-II which deals with taxation. Keeping in mind the difference between the two, we hold that the State law under Entry 8 List-II covers a wider field of use, consumption, possession, diversion etc. vis-a-vis Entry 84 List I, which deals with duty on manufacture of medicinal preparation, as such. This difference is lost sight of by the High Court in the impugned judgment.\u0014 (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 28\\. Applying the above tests laid down in the aforestated judgments to the facts of the present case, we find that Entry 60 of List II, mentions \u0013Taxes on professions, trades, callings and employments\u0014. Entry 60 is a taxing entry. It is not a general entry. Therefore, we hold that tax on professions etc. has to be read as a levy on professions, trades, callings etc., as such. Therefore, Entry 60 which refers to professions cannot be extended to include services.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: This is what is called as an Aspect Theory. If the argument of the appellants is accepted, then there would be no difference between interpretation of a general entry and interpretation of a taxing entry in List I and List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. Therefore, \u0013professions\u0014 will not include services under Entry 60. For the above reasons, we hold that Parliament had absolute jurisdiction and legislative competence to levy tax on services. While interpreting the legislative heads under List II, we have to go by schematic interpretation of the three Lists in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and not by dictionary meaning of the words \u0011profession\u0012 or \u0011professional\u0012 as was sought to be argued on behalf of the appellants otherwise the distinction between general entries and taxing entries under the three Lists would stand obliterated. The words \u0013in relation to\u0014 and the words \u0013with respect to\u0014 are no doubt words of wide amplitude but one has to keep in mind the context in which they are used.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: (iv) Meaning of the words Taxes \u0011on\u0012 professions:\n",
      "Paragraph 68: 29\\. As stated above, Entry 60 List II refers to taxes on professions etc.. It is the tax on the individual person/firm or company. It is the tax on the status. A chartered accountant or a cost accountant obtains a licence or a privilege from the competent Body to practise. On that privilege as such the State is competent to levy a tax under Entry 60. However, as stated above, Entry 60 is not a general entry. It cannot be read to include every activity undertaken by a chartered accountant/cost accountant/architect for consideration. Service tax is a tax on each activity undertaken by a chartered accountant/cost accountant or an architect. The cost accountant/chartered accountant/architect charges his client for advice or for auditing of accounts.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: Similarly, a cost accountant charges his client for advice as well as doing the work of costing. For each transaction or contract, the chartered accountant/cost accountant renders professional based services. The activity undertaken by the chartered accountant or the cost accountant or an architect has two aspects. From the point of view of the chartered accountant/cost accountant it is an activity undertaken by him based on his performance and skill. But from the point of view of his client, the chartered accountant/cost accountant is his service-provider. It is a tax on \u0013services\u0014. The activity undertaken by the chartered accountant or cost accountant is similar to a saleable or marketable commodities produced by the assessee and cleared by the assessee for home consumption under the Central Excise Act. For each contract, tax is levied under the Finance Acts, 1994 and 1998. Tax cannot be levied under that Act without service being provided whereas a professional tax under Entry 60 is a tax on his status. It is the tax on the status of a cost accountant or a chartered accountant. As long as a person/firm remains in the profession, he/it has to pay professional tax. That tax has nothing to do with the commercial activities which he undertakes for his client. Even if the chartered accountant has no work throughout the accounting year, still he has to pay professional tax. He has to pay the tax till he remains in the profession. This is the ambit and scope of Entry 60 List II which is a taxing entry. Therefore, Entry 60 contemplates tax on professions, as such. Entry 60 List II refers to \u0013Tax on employments\u0014. In one case, the question arose whether Parliament was entitled to impose income tax on pension under Entry 82 of List I. The controversy was that \u0013pension\u0014 is a retiral benefit. It was argued that pension was an incident of \u0013employment\u0014 and, therefore, Parliament had no legislative competence to impose income tax under Entry 82 of List I and that the State Legislature alone had absolute jurisdiction to make a law imposing tax on pension. This argument was rejected on the ground that Entry 60 of List II refers to \u0013Tax on employments\u0014, as such. So long as a person is in the employment, he does not earn pension. He earns pension only on retirement. On retirement, he ceases to be in the employment, therefore, on retirement the receipt of pension constitutes \u0013income\u0014 in the hands of the pensioner and, therefore, Parliament had legislative competence to enact Income Tax Act, 1961 under which pension was taxable as income. This example demonstrates the meaning of the word \u0013Taxes on professions, callings, trades and employments\u0014. It also indicates two aspects of the same item, namely, pension. One aspect falls in the category of \u0013employment\u0014, the other falls in the category of \u0013income\u0014.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: Therefore, there is no merit in the contention advanced on behalf of the appellant that the widest possible interpretation should be given to the word \u0013profession\u0014 in Entry 60 List II. We have to keep in mind while interpreting the Entries in the three Lists the distinction between the general entry and the taxing entry.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 30\\. In the case of [?CITATION?] the appellant was a public limited company. It was a lessee of two cinema Houses. It was an exhibitor of cinematograph films. A notice was issued to the appellant by the Cantonment Board under Section 60 of the [Cantonments Act, 1924] imposing tax on entertainments.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: The said levy was challenged on the ground that under Section 100 of the Government of India Act, 1935 (\u0013GOI Act, 1935\u0014) read with Entry 50 in Schedule VII, the Provincial Legislature had power to make law with respect to \u0013Taxes on luxuries, including taxes on entertainments, amusements, betting and gambling\u0014. It was urged on behalf of the appellant that Entry 50 was not applicable since Entry 50 contemplated enactment of a law imposing taxes on persons who receive or enjoy the entertainments/amusements and, therefore, the said entry did not authorize imposition of tax on assessees/persons who provide entertainments or amusements. According to the appellant, Western India Theatres were entertainment providers; that they were not entertainment receivers; that they simply carried on their profession, trade or calling and, therefore, Entry 50 was not applicable. It was further urged that entertainment-providers fell under Entry 46, which Entry is similar to Entry 60 of List II in the present case and which referred taxes on professions, trades, callings and employments. This argument advanced on behalf of the appellant was rejected by this Court. It was held that Entry 50 contemplated a tax on entertainment and amusement as objects on which a tax is to be imposed and, therefore, it was not possible to differentiate between the entertainment- provider and the entertainment-receiver. It was held that entertainment was trade or calling of Western India Theaters and, therefore, the tax imposed on entertainment under the Cantonment Act came within Entry 50 of the Provincial List. The importance of this judgment lies in the fact that this judgment makes a distinction between tax imposed for the privilege of carrying on any trade or calling on one hand and a tax on every show that is to say on every incidence of the exercise of the particular trade or calling. It was held that if there was no show, there was no tax. It was further observed that a lawyer has to pay tax to take out a licence irrespective of whether he actually practices or not. That tax is a tax for the privilege of having the right to exercises the profession if and when the person taking out the license chooses to do so. It was held that the impugned tax on entertainment levied by the Cantonment Board was a tax on the act of entertainment resulting in a show and, therefore, the impugned law imposing tax on entertainment fell under Entry 50 of the Provincial List in Schedule VII to the GOI Act, 1935 and not under Entry 46 (similar to Entry 60 of List II). Therefore, it was held that Bombay Legislature had power to enact the law imposing tax on entertainment which had nothing to do with the law imposing tax on the privilege of carrying on any profession, trade or calling under Entry 46.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: (similar to Entry 60 of List II in the present case.) Therefore, this Court has clarified the dichotomy between tax on privilege of carrying on any trade or calling on one hand and the tax on the activity which an entertainer undertakes on each occasions. The tax on privilege to practice the profession, therefore, falls under Entry 60, List II. It is quite different from tax on services. Keeping in mind the aforestated dichotomy, it is clear that tax on service does not fall under Entry 60 List II. Therefore, Parliament has absolute jurisdiction and legislative competence to enact the law imposing tax on services under Entry 97 List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: (v) Significance of Article 276:\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 31\\. Learned counsel for the appellants in support of his argument that the words \u0011professions\u0012 and \u0011services\u0012 are synonymous for the purposes of deciding the question of legislative competence of the State Legislature under Entry 60 List II, placed heavy reliance on Article 276, which has been quoted hereinabove.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 32\\. Article 276 corresponds to Section 142A of the GOI Act, 1935.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: However, under a large number of laws enacted before the 1935 Act came into force, power was conferred on local Governments and local authorities to impose taxes on certain activities which broadly came under the Heads \u0013Taxes on professions, trades etc.\u0014 on one hand and \u0013Taxes on income\u0014 on the other hand. This resulted in the enactment of Section 142A by British Parliament, which saved the power conferred by pre-existing laws to impose tax on professions, callings etc. but limited the amount payable to a specified amount. At that time, it was Rs. 50.00, which was the tax payable on profession. That was in 1935. Article 276 was, therefore, preceded by Section 142A of the GOI Act, 1935. The limit has been subsequently enhanced. The States\u0012 power to tax professions etc. is founded on Entry 60 of List II and the purpose of Article 276 is not to amend that power but to provide that such tax on professions, trades etc. shall not be invalidated on the ground that it relates to a tax on income. Once the State seeks to exercises its power under Entry 60 List II, it has to comply with the provisions of Article 276. Where, however, the exercise of power by the State overlaps with its power under some other Entry, then the limitation under Article 276(2) shall have no relevance. Thus, Article 276 will not apply to levy of tax on \u0013circumstances and property\u0014 which is referable to Entry 49 and Entry 60 of List II and amongst other Items to Entry 58, taxes on cinematograph shows, taxes on entry of goods. A tax on profession can be imposed if a person carries out a profession whereas a tax on income can be imposed only if there is income. Therefore, a tax on profession is irrespective of the question of income. Article 276 enables the State Legislature to make laws for imposition of taxes on profession, for the benefit of the State, Municipality, District Board etc. by stating that such law shall not be invalid on the ground that it relates to a tax on income. There is a distinction between a tax on professions, trades, callings and employments and a tax on income arising out of such professions, trades etc.. In the former case, it will have to be paid by any person practising that trade, profession etc., whether he derives any income from it or not. This is where the above example of pensioner becomes relevant. A pensioner does not carry out any profession, trade, business or calling. A tax on profession is not a tax on employment. At the time, the tax is levied, the pensioner is not in employment, but he receives an amount of pension that receipt constitutes his income though it might be for past services from an employment.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: 33\\. As stated above, every Entry in the Lists has to be given a schematic interpretation. As stated above, Constitutional law is about concepts and principles. Some of these principles have evolved out of judicial decisions.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: The said test is also applicable to taxation laws. That is the reason why the Entries in the Lists have been divided into two Groups, one dealing with general subjects and other dealing with taxation. The entries dealing with taxation are distinct entries vis-`-vis the general entries. It is for this reason that the doctrine of pith and substance has an important role to play while deciding the scope of each of the entries in the three Lists in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. This doctrine of pith and substance flows from the words in Article 246(1), quoted above, namely, \u0013with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I\u0014. The bottom line of the said doctrine is to look at the legislation as a whole and if it has a substantial connection with the Entry, the matter may be taken to be legislation on the topic. That is why due weightage should be given to the words \u0013with respect to\u0014 in Article 246 as it brings in the doctrine of \u0013pith and substance\u0014 for understanding the scope of legislative powers. Competence to legislate flows from Articles 245, 246 and the other Articles in Part XI. A legislation like Finance Act can be supported on the basis of a number of Entries. In the present case, we are concerned with the Constitutional status of the levy, namely, service tax.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: The nomenclature of a levy is not conclusive for deciding its true character and nature. For deciding the true character and nature of a particular levy, with reference to the legislative competence, the court has to look into the pith and substance of the legislation. The powers of Parliament and State Legislatures are subject to Constitutional limitations. Tax laws are governed by Part XII and Part XIII. Article 265 takes in Article 245 when it says that the tax shall be levied by the authority of law. To repeat, various entries in the Seventh Schedule show that the power to levy tax is treated as a distinct matter for the purpose of legislative competence. This is the underlying principle to differentiate between the two Groups of entries, namely, general entries and taxing entries. We are of the view that taxes on services is a different subject as compared to taxes on professions, trades, callings etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: Therefore, Entry 60 of List II and Entry 92C/97 of List I operate in different spheres.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: (vi) Discussions of Judgments cited on behalf of the appellants:\n",
      "Paragraph 83: 34\\. In the case of [?CITATION?] the assessees/appellants, who were either manufacturers, dealers or sellers of tobacco, had challenged the levy of luxury tax on tobacco and tobacco products by treating them as \u0013luxuries\u0014 within the meaning of the word in Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Uttar Pradesh Tax on Luxuries Act, 1995 and certain other State enactments imposed luxury tax on tobacco by treating it as \u0013luxury\u0014 within the meaning of the word in Entry 62 of List II. It was held by the Constitution Bench of this Court that the word \u0013luxuries\u0014 in Entry 62, List II refers to activities of enjoyment, indulgence or pleasure and since none of the impugned enactments had sought to tax any activity and since the impugned enactments sought to tax \u0013goods\u0014 as luxuries it was held that the said U.P. Tax on Luxuries Act, 1995, Andhra Pradesh Tax on Luxuries Act, 1987 and West Bengal Luxury Tax Act, 1994 were beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: In this connection, it was observed, vide para 57, by the Constitution Bench of this Court that a tax on a thing or goods can only be with reference to a taxable event but there is a distinction between such a tax and a tax on the taxable event. In the first case, the subject-matter of tax is the goods and the taxable event is within the incidence of the tax on the goods. In the second case, the taxable event is the subject-matter of tax itself. In our view, para 57 supports the reasoning given by us hereinabove. As stated above, service tax is a value added tax. Value addition is on account of the activity like planning, consultation, advising etc.. It is an activity, which provides value addition as in the case of manufacturer of goods, which attracts service tax.\n",
      "Paragraph 85: In the present case, tax falls on the activity which is the subject-matter of service tax. In other words, we are substituting the word \u0013service\u0014 in place of \u0013goods\u0014 by applying the principle of equivalence. Under the Act, the Taxable Event is each exercise undertaken by the service-provider in giving advice on tax planning, auditing, costing etc.. It is the said principle of equivalence which equates \u0013service tax\u0014 to the Central Excise Duty, one taxes the provision of services and other production of goods. See para 2.14 of the recommendations made by Tax Reforms Committee headed by Dr. Chelliah which has stated that from the economic point of view, there is little difference between the taxation of commodities and taxation of services.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: 35\\. In the case of [?CITATION?] the appellants were transport operators. The State of Haryana levied a tax on passengers and goods under the Haryana Passengers and Goods Taxation Act, 1952. The appellants questioned the vires of Section 3(3) insofar as the levy of tax on passengers and goods carrying by their vehicles plying along the National Highway. It was urged on behalf of the appellants that there was nothing in the Constitution to prevent Parliament from combining its power to legislate with respect to any matters enumerated in Entries 1 to 96 of List I with its power to legislate under Entry 97 of List I and, if so, then the power to legislate with respect to tax on passengers and goods carried on National Highway was within the exclusive legislative competence of Parliament and, therefore, Section 3(3) of Haryana Passengers and Goods Taxation Act, 1952 was beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature. This argument was rejected by the Division Bench of this Court, which took the view that before exclusive legislative competence can be claimed for Parliament by resort to Entry 97 List I, the legislative competence of the State Legislature must be established. Entry 97 itself was specific. In that, a matter can be brought under that Entry only if it is not enumerated in Lists II or III, and in the case of a tax, if it is not mentioned in either of those Lists.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: We do not dispute the above proposition. That proposition is well settled.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: This Court is concerned with the application of the said principle in this case. In the present matter, as stated hereinabove, the State Legislature is empowered to levy tax on professions, trades, callings etc., as such and, therefore, the word \u0013services\u0014 cannot be read as synonymous to the word \u0013profession\u0014 in entry 60. Therefore, tax on services do not fall under Entry 60 List II. That, service tax would fall under Entry 92C/Entry 97 of List I.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: 36\\. In the case of [?CITATION?] the appellants claimed a right to engage in trading business on the pavements of Delhi city. In that context, it was held by the Constitution bench of this Court that, the guarantee under Article 19(1)(g) extends to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. In that case, the word \u0013profession\u0014 had been defined to mean an occupation carried on by virtue of specialized qualifications, personal qualifications, training or skill. We do not find any relevance of this judgment to the present case. As stated above, we are concerned with interpretation of legislative heads under the three Lists in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. As stated above, we have to go by the schematic interpretation of those entries. Moreover, we are concerned with a distinct taxing entries and not general entries. Hence, the judgment in the case of Sodan Singh (supra) has no application to the present case.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: 37\\. In the case of [?CITATION?] the Division Bench of this Court held that service tax is an indirect tax and is to be paid on all the services notified by the Government of India. It has been further held that the said tax is on \u0013service\u0014 and not on the service-provider. In paragraph 58 it has been observed that under Article 246(1) of the Constitution, Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. As per Article 246(3), the State Government has exclusive powers to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in List II (State List). In the said judgment, it has been held that service tax is made by Parliament under Entry 97 of List I. In our view, therefore, the point in issue in the present case is squarely covered by the judgment of this Court in the case of Tamil Nadu Kalyana Mandapam (supra). Of course, in the present case, we are not concerned with the services rendered by a Mandap-keeper, who performs what is called as property based services. In this case, we are concerned with performance based services. However, both the categories fall within the ambit of the word \u0011services\u0012.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: 38\\. In the case of [?CITATION?] it was held that service tax is not a tax on goods or on passengers but it was on the transportation itself and, therefore, it falls under residuary power of Parliament under Entry 97 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. It was further held that service tax is not a levy on passengers or goods but on the event of service in connection with the carriage of goods and, therefore, it was not possible to hold that the Act was in pith and substance within the State\u0012s exclusive powers under Entry 56 of List II. It was held that service tax came within Entry 97 of List I. In the present case, as stated above, we are concerned with Entry 60 of List II. As stated above, service tax is on performance based services itself. It is on professional advice, tax planning, auditing, costing etc.. On each of the exercise undertaken tax becomes payable.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: Therefore, the above judgment has no application.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: 39\\. In the case of [?CITATION?] the question which arose for determination before this Court was whether a telephone service (mobile or fixed) would attract liability to service tax. It was held that in order to attract the liability under the service tax there has to exist what is called as \u0013goods\u0014.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: Since goods in question consisted of electromagnetic waves or radio frequencies, which carries voice, messages or other data, a telephone service was nothing but a service. We are not concerned with such a controversy in the present case. In the present case, we are concerned with the legislative competence of Parliament to legislate in respect of service tax under Entry 97/92C of List I. In the present case, we are concerned with the period covered by the Finance Acts of 1994 and 1998. However, learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon para 82 of the said judgment in the case of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (supra) in which it is observed that the residuary powers of Parliament under Entry 97 of List I cannot swamp away the legislative Entries in the State List. Entry 54, List II read with Article 366(29-A), therefore, cannot be whittle down by referring to the residuary provision. As stated above, we are concerned with the application of the above principles. In the present case, as stated above, we are concerned with the Constitutional status of the levy. As stated above, we have to examine the nature of the levy. We have done so and we have come to the conclusion that the word profession in Entry 60 List II cannot be made synonymous with the word service and, therefore, service tax would fall under the residuary Entry 97 read with Entry 92C after 2003. This position is also made clear by Article 268A, inserted by the Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: 40\\. Lastly, in our view, the judgment of this Court in the case of [?CITATION?] has no application to the facts of the present case. In that case this Court observed that there was a basic distinction between a tax on \u0013income\u0014 and a tax on \u0013circumstances and property\u0014. If there is no income, there can be no income tax. In contrast, in the case of a tax on \u0013circumstances and property\u0014 there can be a tax on the total turn-over of the assessee from his trade or calling or on his having an interest in the property. It was held that whereas Entry 49 of List II relates to taxes on lands and buildings, Entry 60 relates to taxes on professions and, therefore, the true nature of the tax in that case was not a tax on income but it was a tax referable to Entry 49 and Entry 60 of List II. It was held that the impugned tax was a composite tax, one of its components being the \u0013circumstance\u0014, namely, the financial position of the assessee. It may be clarified that in the case of R.R.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: Engineering Co. (supra) the validity of the levy was under challenge and that levy constituted what is called a composite tax. We do not see any relevance of the judgment in the case of R.R. Engineering Co. (supra) to the facts of the present case. In the present case, we are not concerned with a composite tax. Hence, the judgment of this Court in the case of R.R.\n",
      "Paragraph 97: Engineering Co. (supra) has no relevance to the facts of the present case.\n",
      "Paragraph 98: Conclusion:\n",
      "Paragraph 99: 41\\. For the above reasons, we find no merit in Civil Appeal No. 7128 of 2001 filed by All India Federation of Tax Practitioners and ors.. We hold that Parliament has legislative competence to levy service tax by way of impugned Finance Acts of 1994 and 1998 under Entry 97 of List I on chartered accountants, cost accountants and architects. We further hold that the above position now stands fortified by the Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003 which has inserted Article 268A and Entry 92C which clearly indicates that Entry 60 of List II and Entry 92C of List I operate in different spheres. However, we make it clear that before us there is no challenge to the Constitutional validity of the said Constitution (Eighty- eighth Amendment) Act, 2003.\n",
      "Paragraph 100: 42\\. Accordingly, the civil appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs. \n"

      "Paragraph 2: 1\\. Leave granted.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 2\\. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court dated 10.2.2009 in Appeal No.133 of 2002 arising out of Writ Petition No. 2148 of 2001, whereby the Division Bench has held that for the first respondent establishment, the Central Government was the `appropriate government' for the purposes of application of Section 2(3) of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act 1971 (hereinafter referred to as the M.R.T.U. and P.U.L.P. Act) read with Section 2(a) of the [Industrial Disputes Act 1947] (hereinafter referred to as the I.D. Act). The Division Bench has held that the State Government was not the `appropriate 2 government' for this purpose. Consequently the Applications concerned in the present matter filed under the MRTU and PULP Act, namely the Application of the second respondent for cancellation of the status of the applicant as the recognized union under respondent No. 1, and Application for substitution of second respondent in place of the appellant, as the recognized union, were held to be non- maintainable. The appellant is aggrieved by the finding that the State Government is not the appropriate government and that the MRTU and PULP Act has no application to the first respondent establishment. It will result into automatic denial of its status as the recognized union under the MRTU and PULP Act and also into denial of the remedies available to the appellant and to the employees, of the first respondent, (against unfair labour practices, if any) and hence this appeal by special leave. The right of the appellant to represent the employees of the first respondent (numbering over 1300) is thus, at stake.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 3\\. The appellant is a Trade Union, registered under the Trade Unions Act 1926 and the employees of the first respondent are its members. It is already registered under Chapter III of the above referred MRTU and PULP Act as the recognized union for the employees under the first respondent by an order passed way back on 2.12.1985 by the Industrial Court, Mumbai. Respondent No.2 `Tata Memorial Hospital Kamgar Sanghatana' (i.e. workers association) is another trade union functioning under the first respondent. By filing Application MRTU No. 15 of 1994 before the Industrial Court, Mumbai, the respondent No. 2 sought cancellation of the recognition of the appellant union under Section 13 of the MRTU and PULP 3 Act. Thereafter by filing another Application MRTU No.16 of 1994, the second respondent sought its own recognition in place of the appellant union under Section 14 of the MRTU and PULP Act. Both these Applications Nos. 15 and 16 of 1994 were heard together. Oral and documentary evidence was led by parties. The report of the Investigating officer appointed for the verification of the membership of the two trade unions was considered. The first respondent in its written statement raised an objection to the maintainability of these proceedings under MRTU and PULP Act by submitting that the `appropriate government' for the first respondent was the Central Government and not the State Government, and hence, the proceedings under the MRTU and PULP, were not maintainable.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 4\\. The Application (MRTU) 15 of 1994 had been filed on the footing that the registration of the appellant as a trade union itself had been cancelled by the Registrar of Trade Unions under the Trade Union Act, 1926. The appellant pointed out to the Industrial Court that the order of cancellation was misconceived and had in fact been stayed by the Bombay High Court by its order passed in the Writ Petition No. 452 of 1994. Thereupon, the second respondent conceded this position and filed a pursis (memo) that Application (MRTU) No. 15 of 1994 be allowed to be withdrawn. The Industrial Court disposed of the two proceedings by its common judgment and order dated 29.6.2001. In that order it recorded that Application MRTU No. 15 of 1994 was being disposed of for want of prosecution. As far as the Application No. 16 of 1994 is concerned, the Industrial Court accepted the report of the Investigating Officer whereunder he had held that during the relevant period for 4 consideration of the Application under section 14 of the MRTU & PULP Act, the valid membership of the appellant union was more than that of the second respondent union. While deciding so, it examined the material on record, considered the rival submissions and held that the `appropriate government' for the first respondent was the State Government. Therefore, although the two Applications were held to be maintainable under the MRTU and PULP Act, the Application No. 16 of 1994 was dismissed on merits.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 5\\. The first respondent filed Writ Petition No. 2148 of 2001 to challenge this judgment and order. The petition came to be dismissed by a Single Judge of the High Court by holding that the first respondent is an autonomous body and though the Central Government was funding the first respondent partially, it had only a partial control thereof. The Single Judge accepted the findings of the Industrial Court on the issue of appropriate government to be just, legal and proper and, therefore, dismissed the Writ Petition, by his order dated 29.10.2001. This was on consideration of the judgment of this court in [?CITATION?] (which had been rendered in the meanwhile on 30.8.2001). This order of the Single Judge has come to be reversed by the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench. The Division Bench has held that the Governing Council of the first respondent was managing the institution as a delegate of the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: This was also on basis of its consideration of the judgment in Steel Authority of India & Ors. (supra). The Division Bench held that the Central Government was the 5 appropriate government for the first respondent and allowed the appeal.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: Consequently, it set aside the orders passed by the Single Judge as well as by the Industrial Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 6\\. Being aggrieved by this judgment and order of the Division Bench the present appeal by special leave has been filed. The appeal raises the question as to whether the Division Bench correctly applied the law laid down by this Court in Steel Authority of India (Supra) to the facts of the present case. Though the second respondent has been described as a proforma respondent, notices were issued to both the respondents and the affidavit of service with proof has been filed by the appellant with respect to both of them. The petition has been opposed by the first respondent by filing an exhaustive counter and the appellant has filed a rejoinder thereto. Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned Senior Counsel has addressed us on behalf of the appellant, whereas Mr. Soli J.Sorabjee, learned Senior Counsel, has defended the order of the Division Bench. Both the parties have submitted their written submissions and we have considered the same also.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 7\\. Necessary Relevant Facts Before dealing with the rival submissions on the issue before the Court, viz. as to whether in the facts of the present case the central government or the state government is the `appropriate government,' it will be desirable to refer to the necessary relevant facts. The trustees of a public charitable trust known as Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, established sometime in the year 1940, a hospital in Mumbai, 6 named as the Tata Memorial Hospital for the Treatment and Cure of Cancer and Allied Diseases. The hospital was then being maintained out of the funds of the trust and also from the grant made available from time to time by the Central Government and by the then Government of Bombay.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 8\\. The Government of India was desirous of establishing an Indian Cancer Research Centre for Post-Graduate Teaching and Research in Cancer and the same was established in collaboration with the trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust by an agreement dated 7.10.1953. The Government of India gave the initial grant for that Centre for setting up of a laboratory on a portion of the land belonging to the trust and also undertook to provide recurring expenditure in respect of salaries of the staff and contingencies of the management of the said Center.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 9\\. The trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust subsequently decided to dedicate the hospital to the Nation with all its assets, including its funds and the plots of land. They requested the Government of India to takeover its control and management with effect from 4.2.1957. Accordingly, an agreement was entered into between the trustees and the Central Government on 4.2.1957 and under clause (1) thereof, the government agreed to takeover control and management of the hospital and to manage it at its own expenses from 1.4.1957. Under clause (2) of the agreement, the management of the hospital was to rest in the hands of the Governing Board consisting of seven members of the Board. Three of them were to be nominated by the Government of India and three by Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. The 7 Superintendent of the Hospital was to be the ex- officio seventh member of the Governing Board and its Secretary. Clause (3) of this agreement provided as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 13: \"The Trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust shall convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the Government of India the immoveable properties and moveable properties and assets of the hospital including the Cancer Infirmary Fund and the assets of the Indian Cancer Research Centre and the three plots refereed to above\" (i.e.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: plots 107, 108 & 109 of Scheme No.60, Naigaum Estate,Mumbai).\n",
      "Paragraph 15: 10\\. The Trustees accordingly, filed a suit being suit No. 568 of 1957 in the Bombay City Civil Court for framing a Scheme and for giving effect to and incorporating the said agreement dated 4.2.1957. The City Civil Court passed a decree on 22.3.1957 and sanctioned the scheme as annexed to the schedule. The relevant part of the court's order recorded that the properties to be conveyed, transferred or assigned by the trustees to the government being immovable properties described in schedule `B' thereto are hereby vested in the government.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: The administrative control of the Tata Memorial Hospital and the Indian Cancer Research Centre was thereafter transferred to the Government of India. It first came under the Ministry of Health and thereafter under the Department of Atomic Energy with effect from 1.2.1962.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: 11\\. The Tata Memorial Centre has come to be specifically mentioned in the rules for allocation of business of Government of India framed under Article 77 of the Constitution of India. The President of India in exercise of his powers under Article 77, has framed by order dated 14.1.1961, the Rules for allocation of business of the Government of India. Rule 2 thereof deals with the allocation of business and 8 it states that the business of the government shall be transacted in the Ministries, Departments and Secretariats, as specified in the first schedule to these rules (all of which are referred to as the departments). Item 22 of the first schedule to the said rules, deals with the Department of Atomic Energy and item 10 of the annexure to the schedule concerning Department of Atomic Energy reads as followed:\n",
      "Paragraph 18: \"10\\. All matters relating the Tata Memorial Centre, Bombay.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 19: 12\\. Subsequently, an agreement was entered into between the Government of India and the trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust on 6.1.1966, and the two institutions viz. Tata Memorial Hospital and Indian Cancer Research Centre were amalgamated into an institution thereafter known as the Tata Memorial Centre i.e.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: respondent No.1 herein. The Tata Memorial Centre was registered as a Society under the [Societies Registration Act 1860] and also as a Public Trust, under the Bombay Public Trust Act 1950. Under the rules and Regulations of this Society, the administration and management of the Centre vests in a Governing Council under Rule 3 thereof, and this council is the executive body of the Centre. The council is constituted under Rule 4 thereof. Rule 3 and 4 (i) of these Rules and Regulations read as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 3\\. Administration and Management : Subject to these Rules and such rules as may hereafter be made from time to time, the administration and management of the Centre shall vest in the Council, which shall be the executive body of the Centre.\n",

PROVIDED that, to represent other interests, not more than two additional members may be co-opted by the Council, for such periods as the Council may decide with the concurrence of the Government of India and the Trustees of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 13\\. The question for our consideration is whether the first respondent functions under the authority of the Central Government as its delegate as held by the Division Bench or is functioning as an independent entity. This will enable us to decide as to whether the Central Government or the State Government is the \"appropriate government\" for the first respondent. We have also to keep in mind that we have to decide this issue in the context of determination of an application for recognition of a trade union.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: Statutory Framework\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 14\\. As stated earlier, the two Applications filed before the Industrial Court, Mumbai which had led to the present Special Leave Petition were filed under Sections 13 & 14 of the MRTU and PULP Act 1971. These Sections 13 & 14 appear in Chapter-III of the MRTU & PULP Act which Chapter deals with Recognition of unions. Section 13 deals with Cancellation of recognition and suspension of rights of a recognized union on the conditions stipulated therein. Section 14 deals with Recognition of other union in place of a union already registered as a recognized 1 union and conditions therefor. As the preamble of this Act lays down, one of the objectives of this Act is to provide for the recognition of trade unions for facilitating collective bargaining for certain undertakings, to state their rights and obligations;\n",
      "Paragraph 30: and to confer certain powers on unrecognized unions. The other objective of this Act is to prevent unfair practices with which, we are not directly concerned in the present matter.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: 15\\. Since the question raised in the matter is whether the two applications filed under Sections 13 and 14 of MRTU and PULP Act were maintainable or not, the same will depend upon as to whether the State Government is the `appropriate government' for the first respondent. Section 2 of the MRTU and PULP Act is relevant in this behalf. It deals with the extent, commencement and application of the Act. We are concerned with sub-Section (3) thereof which reads as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 32: \"(1) ................................................\n",
      "Paragraph 33: (2) .................................................\n",
      "Paragraph 34: (3) Except as otherwise hereinafter provided, this Act shall apply, to the industries to which the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946, Bom. XI of 1947, for the time being applies, and also to any industry as defined in clause (j) of section 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, XIV of 1947, and the State Government in relation to any industrial dispute concerning such industry is the appropriate Government under that Act;\n",
      "Paragraph 35: Provided that the State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette, direct that the provisions of this Act shall cease to apply to any such industry from such date as may be specified in the notification; and from that date, the provisions of this Act shall cease to apply to that industry and, thereupon, section 7 of the Bombay 1 General Clauses Act, [1904, Bom. 1 ] of 1904, shall apply to such cessor, as if this Act has been repealed in relation to such industry by a Maharashtra Act.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 16\\. It is not disputed that the first respondent is an `industry' within the concept of industry as defined in Section 2(j) of the [Industrial Disputes Act 1947].\n",
      "Paragraph 37: The respondent No. 1 is admittedly not covered under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act 1946. The question is whether in relation to any industrial dispute concerning the first respondent, the State Government is the `appropriate government' under the [Industrial Disputes Act 1947].\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 17\\. It, therefore, becomes necessary to look into the definition of `appropriate government' under the [Industrial Disputes Act 1947]. Under Section 2(a) of the [Industrial Disputes Act 1947] `appropriate government' means;\n",
      "Paragraph 39: (i) in relation to any industrial dispute concerning an industry carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government, (or concerning, industries specifically mentioned in this sub- section starting from a railway company upto a major port), the Central Government; and (ii) in relation to any other industrial dispute, the State Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: Thus, it is clear that under the [Industrial Disputes Act], the Central Government is the `appropriate government' in relation to the industrial disputes concerning the industries specified under Section 2 (a) (i) and for the industries carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government. Excluding these two categories of industries in relation to any other industrial dispute, it is the State Government which is the `appropriate government'.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 1\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 18\\. Entry 22 in list III - Concurrent List to the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India relates to `Trade Unions; Industrial and Labour disputes'. Entry 23 thereunder is `social security and social insurance; employment and unemployment'. Entry 24 is `welfare of labour including conditions of work, provident fund, employer's liability, workmen's compensation, invalidity and old age pensions and maternity benefits'. Subject to the provisions contained in sub-clauses (1) and (2) in Article 246, the Legislature of a State can also make laws on these subjects, and this is how the MRTU and PULP Act 1971 makes provisions for recognition of trade unions for collective bargaining, and for prevention of unfair labour practices.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: It is also in the fitness of things that the [Industrial Disputes Act] which is the principal Central Act for investigation and settlement of Industrial Disputes lays down that for the industrial disputes concerning the specified industries and for those carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government, the Central Government will be the `appropriate government', but in relation to any other industrial dispute the State Government will be the `appropriate government'. It, therefore, becomes necessary to examine the phrase `any industry carried on by or under the authority' of Central Government on this background while applying it to a particular industry and in the instant case, to the first respondent.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 19\\. Explanation of the concept of appropriate government by the Judiciary:-- The appeal raises the question as to whether the Division Bench has correctly applied the law laid down in Steel Authority of India (supra). The Steel Authority of India judgment however once again reiterates the law laid down way back in [?CITATION?], though with a little divergence. It therefore becomes necessary to examine as to how the concept of appropriate government has been explained by the judiciary in the leading decisions. That will enable us to find out as to what are the tests in this behalf which have evolved over the years. In Heavy Engineering case, the State of Bihar had referred an industrial dispute between the Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd., a company wholly owned by the Central Government and its workmen for its adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal. The appellant mazdoor union challenged the reference contending that the `appropriate government' to refer the dispute was the Central Government and not the State Government. The High Court rejected the contention, and hence the matter was carried to this Court. This Court noted that the Heavy Engineering Corporation is a Government company within the meaning of Section 617 of the Companies Act, since its entire share capital was contributed by the Central Government and its shares were registered in the name of the President of India and officers of the Central Government. The memorandum of association and the articles of association of the company conferred large powers on the Central Government including the power to give directions as regards the functioning of the company. The wages and salaries of the employees were also determined in accordance with these directions. The Directors of the company were appointed by the President of India. The Company was described in its standing orders as a Government Undertaking.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 1\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 20\\. It was accepted by the corporation that it could not be said to be an `industry' carried on by the Central Government. The limited issue was whether it could be regarded as an `industry', carried on under the authority of the Central Government. The question was as to how to construe the phrase `under the authority of Central Government'.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: This court held;\n",
      "Paragraph 48: ....There being nothing in s. 2 (a) to the contrary, the word `authority' must be construed according to its ordinary meaning and therefore must mean a legal power given by one person to another to do an act. A person is said to be authorized or to have an authority when he is in such a position that he can act in a certain manner without incurring liability, to which he would be exposed but for the authority, or, so as to produce the same effect as if the person granting the authority had for himself done the act. For instance, if A authorizes B to sell certain goods for and on his behalf and B does so, incurs no liability for so doing in respect of such goods and confers good title on the purchaser. There clearly arises in such a case the relationship of a principal and an agent. The words \"under the authority of\"\n",
      "Paragraph 49: means pursuant to the authority, such as where an agent or a servant acts under or pursuant to the authority of his principal or master. Can the respondent-company, therefore, be said to be carrying on its business pursuant to the authority of the Central Government? That obviously cannot be said of a company incorporated under the Companies Act whose constitution, powers and functions are provided for and regulated by its memorandum of association and the articles of association.\" (underlining supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 21\\. This Court noted that an incorporated company has a separate existence and the law recognizes it as a juristic person, separate and distinct from its members. Its rights and obligations are different from those of its shareholders.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: Action taken against it does not directly affect its shareholders. The company so incorporated derives its powers and functions from and by virtue and memorandum of association and its articles of association. The mere fact that the entire share 1 capital of the company was contributed by the Central Government and the fact that all its shares are held by the President and certain officers of the Central Government does not make any difference. The court noted that a notice to the President of India and the officers of the Central Government, who hold between them all the shares of the company would not be a notice to the company nor can a suit maintainable by and in the name of the company be sustained by or in the name of the President and the said officers.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: 22\\. The Court noted that the extensive powers are conferred on the Central Government including the power to give directions as to how the company should function, the power to appoint its Director and even the power to determine the wages and salaries payable by the company to its employees but these powers were derived by the company's memorandum of association and the articles of association and not by reason of the company being an agent of the Central Government. The court thereafter observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 53: ..... The question whether a corporation is an agent of the State must depend on the facts of each case. Where a statute setting up a corporation so provides, such a corporation can easily be identified as the agent of the state as in [?CITATION?], where Phillimore, J. said that the Crown does in certain cases establish with the consent of Parliament certain officials or bodies who are to be treated as agents of the Crown even though they have the power of contracting as principals. In the absence of a statutory provision, however, a commercial corporation acting on its own behalf, even though it is controlled wholly or partially by a Government department, will be ordinarily presumed not to be a servant or agent of the State. The fact that a minister appoints the members or directors of a corporation and he is entitled to call for information, to give directions which are binding on the directors and to supervise over the conduct of the business of the corporation does not render the corporation an agent of the Government. (see [?CITATION?], and [?CITATION?]. Such an interference that the corporation is the agent of the Government may be drawn where it is performing in substance governmental and non commercial functions. (cf [?CITATION?])\n",
      "Paragraph 54: (underlining supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 55: 23\\. Then the Court looked into the definition of `employer' as given in Section 2 (g) of the [Industrial Disputes Act]. As this section provides, an employer under clause (g) means, an employer in relation to an `industry' carried on by or under the authority of any department of the Central Government or the State Government, the Authority prescribed in that behalf, or where no such authority is prescribed, the head of the Department. No such authority was prescribed in regard to the business carried on by the respondent company. The Court observed that the definition of the `employer' under the [Industrial Disputes Act] on the contrary suggests that an industry carried on by or under the authority of the Government means either the industry carried on directly by a department of the Government such as the posts and telegraphs or railway, or one carried on by such department through the instrumentality of an agent. All these facts led this Court to hold that the Heavy Engineering Corporation could not be said to be an `industry' carried on under the authority of the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 24\\. We have referred to the Judgment in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union (Supra) extensively for the reason that it has been followed consistently including the last relevant judgment of the Constitution Bench in Steel Authority of India Ltd. (Supra), though with a slight divergence. The next judgment of significance after Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Sangh, is [?CITATION?] In that matter a bench of three judges was concerned with the dispute between the management of the Barrackpore branch of the appellant Government Company situated in West Bengal and its employees. The appellant had challenged the Award of the Fifth Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal and one of the challenges was to the competence of the Government of West Bengal to make the reference of the industrial dispute. It was contended that the Barrackpore branch was under the direct control of the Bangalore Division of the Company and since it was a Government Company constituted under section 617 of the Companies Act, (the shares of which were entirely owned by the Central Government), the reference ought to have been made either by the Central Government or by the Government of Karnataka. This Court negatived the contention. It noted that the Barrackpore Branch was a separate branch and for the purposes of this Act it was an industry carried on by the Company as a separate unit. This court followed the dicta in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union (supra) and observed in para 4 as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 57: \"The workers were receiving their pay packages at Barrackpore and were under the control of the officers of the company stationed there. If there was any disturbance of industrial peace at Barrackpore where a considerable number of workmen were working the appropriate government concerned in the maintenance of the industrial peace was the West Bengal Government. The grievances of the workmen of Barrackpore were their own and the cause of action in relation to the industrial dispute in question arose there. The reference, therefore, for adjudication of such a dispute by the Governor of West Bengal was good and valid. (underlining supplied) 1\n",
      "Paragraph 58: 25\\. In [?CITATION?], a reference (though under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946) of the demands of the employees for payment of bonus was challenged on the ground that an authorized controller under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 had been appointed in respect of the industrial undertaking and since the undertaking was being run by an authorized controller under the authority of a department of the Central Government, the reference under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946 was not competent. A bench of three judges of this Court once again referred to the interpretation of the expression `under the authority of' rendered in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union's case. The Court noted that in reaching its conclusion in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union's case (supra) this Court had approved the view of Calcutta High Court in [?CITATION?] wherein a Division Bench that Court, had held that business which is carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government must be a Government business. The High Court had further held that in any industry to be carried on under the authority of the Central Government it must be an industry belonging to the Central Government, that is to say, its own undertaking. The Court held in para 17;\n",
      "Paragraph 59: \"The fact that the authorized controller is appointed by the Central Government and that he has to work subject to the directions of the Central Government does not render the industrial undertaking an agent of the Central Government and therefore, 1 could not be said to be an establishment engaged in an industry carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 26\\. The Judgment in Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh (supra) was followed by the Judgment in [?CITATION?] Therein, the Court was concerned with the Writ Petition filed by the employees seeking the regularization of their services under the [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970] (for short the CLRA Act). In that matter, inspite of the fact that FCI is a specified industry under Section 2(a) (i) of the [Industrial Disputes Act 1947], this Court referred to the definition of `appropriate government' under the CLRA Act 1970. It referred to judgments in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union and Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh (supra) with approval, and held that for the regional offices and warehouses which were situated in various states, the State Governments were the `appropriate Governments' and not the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 27\\. The scheme of the CLRA Act 1970 came up for consideration before a bench of three Judges in [?CITATION?]. The Court was concerned with the question as to whether the Central Government was the competent appropriate government for the purposes of the notification which it had issued under that Act to abolish the Contract Labour system in the establishment of the appellant. The court held that the Central Government was the appropriate government. The definition of `appropriate government' under Section 2 (1) (a) of that Act was examined by this Court and which reads as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 62: 2 \"[(a) \"appropriate Government\" means,- (i) in relation to an establishment in respect of which the appropriate Government under the [Industrial Disputes Act], 1947 (14 of 1947), is the Central Government, the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: (ii) in relation to any other establishment, the Government of the State in which that other establishment is situated;] A bench of three Judges, therefore, examined the efficacy of the judgments starting from Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union case (supra). After examining the principles arising out of some of the leading judgments on Article 12 of the Constitution of India, such as those in the case of [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] (a Constitution Bench Judgment), the Court held that corporations and companies controlled and held by the State Governments will be institutions of those states within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. A Priori, in relation to corporations and companies held and controlled by the Central Government, the `appropriate government' will be the Central Government. In paragraph 28 the court observed : --- '28. From this perspective and on deeper consideration, we are of the considered view that the two Judge bench in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union case narrowly interpreted the words `appropriate government' on the common law principles which no longer bear any relevance when it is tested on the anvil of Article 14.' ..........\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 28\\. The question concerning interpretation of the concept of `appropriate government' in Section 2 (1) (a) of the CLRA Act 1970 and in Section 2 (a) of the 2 [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] was subsequently referred to a Constitution Bench in [?CITATION?]. The Constitution Bench examined the relevant provisions and the judgments including those in the cases of R.D. Shetty and Ajay Hasia (supra). The question decided by Constitution Bench of this Court in Ajay Hasia was with respect to Jammu & Kashmir Regional Engineering College, Srinagar, which was registered as a society under the Jammu & Kashmir Registration of Societies Act 1898 and wherein it was held to be a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 29\\. In para 37 of the judgment in Steel Authority of India Ltd. (supra), this court held that merely because the government companies, corporations and societies are instrumentalities or agencies of the Government, they do not become agents of the Central or the State Government for all purposes. The Court held as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 66: \"37\\. We wish to clear the air that the principle, while discharging public functions and duties the government companies/corporations/societies which are instrumentalities or agencies of the Government must be subjected to the same limitations in the field of public law -- constitutional or administrative law -- as the Government itself, does not lead to the inference that they become agents of the Centre/State Government for all purposes so as to bind such Government for all their acts, liabilities and obligations under various Central and/or State Acts or under private law.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 30\\. In para 38, this Court thereafter held as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 68: \" 38\\. From the above discussion, it follows that the fact of being an instrumentality of a Central/State Government or being \"State\" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution cannot be determinative of 2 the question as to whether an industry carried on by a company/corporation or an instrumentality of the Government is by or under the authority of the Central Government for the purpose of or within the meaning of the definition of \"appropriate Government\" in the CLRA Act. .................................................\n",
      "Paragraph 69: Further, the definition of \"establishment\" in the CLRA Act takes in its fold purely private undertakings which cannot be brought within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution.

      "Paragraph 70: whether the industry carried on by the establishment in question is under the authority of the Central Government. Obviously, there cannot be one test for one part of the definition of \"establishment\" and another test for another part. Thus, it is clear that the criterion is whether an undertaking/instrumentality of the Government is carrying on an industry under the authority of the Central Government and not whether the undertaking is an instrumentality or agency of the Government for purposes of Article 12 of the Constitution, be it of the Central Government or the State Government.

      "Paragraph 71: \"39\\. To hold that the Central Government is \"the appropriate Government\" in relation to an establishment, the court must be satisfied that the particular industry in question is carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government.

Such an authority may be conferred, either by a statute or by virtue of the relationship of principal and agent or delegation of power. Where the authority, to carry on any industry for or on behalf of the Central Government, is conferred on the government company/any undertaking by the statute under which it is created, no further question arises. But, if it is not so, the question that arises is whether there is any conferment of authority on the government company/any undertaking by the Central Government to carry on the industry in question. This is a question of fact and has to be ascertained on the facts and in the circumstances of each case.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 72: 32\\. In the next para 40 the Constitution Bench states that it shall refer to the cases of this court on this point and thereafter examines in paragraphs 41 to 44 2 the earlier referred judgments in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union, Hindustan Aeronautics, Rashtirya Mill Mazdoor Sangh and Food Corporation of India (supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 73: 33\\. In paragraph 41 of the judgment, the Constitution Bench examined the Judgment in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union case. In Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union the court had observed that an inference that the corporation was the agent of the Government might be drawn where it was performing in substance governmental and not commercial functions. The Constitution Bench disagreed with the distinction thus made between the Governmental activity and commercial function of Government Companies. Barring this limited disagreement, however at the end of para 41 the Constitution Bench observed that it is evident that the court correctly posed the question whether the State Government or the Central Government was the `appropriate government' and rightly answered it.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: 34\\. In paragraph 42, the Constitution Bench examined the judgment of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (supra). The Constitution Bench noted that the judgment in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union case was followed in Hindustan Aeronautics and it had taken note of the factor that if there was any disturbance of industrial peace in Barrackpore, the `appropriate government' concerned for the maintenance of internal peace was the West Bengal Government. The court observed that the factors which weighed with the Court could not be said to be irrelevant.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 35\\. In para 43 the Constitution Bench examined the judgment in Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh (supra) wherein although an authorized controller was 2 appointed to replace the management of the respondent Model Mill, the Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh judgment had held that the undertaking could not be held to be carried on under the authority of the Central Government. The Constitution Bench quoted the observations from the judgment with approval.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 36\\. In para 44 the Constitution Bench referred to the FCI case (supra). It noted that the FCI judgment had followed the judgments in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union and Rashtriya Mazdoor Mill Sangh (supra) to hold that the State Government was the `appropriate government' pertaining to the regional offices and warehouses of the FCI under the CLRA Act. At the end of this para the Constitution Bench concluded \"we find no illegality either in the approach or in the conclusion arrived at by the court in these cases.\" (underlining supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 37\\. In paragraphs 45 and 46, thereafter once again the Constitution Bench turned to the judgment in Air India case and in para 46 it concluded as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 78: \" We have held above that in the case of a Central Government company/undertaking, an instrumentality of the Government, carrying on an industry, the criteria to determine whether the Central Government is the appropriate Government within the meaning of the CLRA Act, is that the industry must be carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government and not that the company/undertaking is an instrumentality or an agency of the Central Government for purposes of Article 12 of the Constitution; such an authority may be conferred either by a statute or by virtue of the relationship of principal and agent or delegation of power and this fact has to be ascertained on the facts and in the circumstances of each case. In view of this conclusion, with due respect, we are unable to agree with the view expressed by the learned Judges on interpretation of the expression \"appropriate Government\" in Air India case.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 79: (underlining supplied) 2 Submissions on behalf of the Appellant\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 38\\. On this background the submission on behalf of the appellant was that way back since 1966 when the Tata Memorial Centre (T.M.C.) was constituted into a separate society and a public trust, it has all throughout functioned as an independent entity and it could not be considered to be a delegate of the Central Government. It was submitted that at the inception the Tata Memorial Hospital was set up out of the funds of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and not of the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: The Government of India established the Indian Cancer Research Centre, but that was also under an agreement dated 7.10.1953 and in collaboration with the trustees of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. The Government of India did give the initial grant and undertook to provide recurring expenses in respect of the staff and contingencies of the management but the centre was established on the land belonging to the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. Later on, the Central Government did take over the Hospital after the Trust decided to dedicate it to the nation. However, at all material times, part of the expenses of the Hospital have been met from the funds generated by the Hospital. After the formation of Respondent No. 1 as a registered society in 1966 also, the internal sources generate 1/3rd, (i.e approximately 25 crores out of 75 crores) of the funds which are utilized for running the Hospital. Thus, the following factors approved by the Industrial Court and the learned Single Judge were pressed into service on behalf of the appellants, 2 i) In its inception the entire share capital and assets of T.M.C. were not solely owned or contributed by the Government of India in view of the donation by Dorabji Trust;\n",
      "Paragraph 82: ii) T.M.C is not wholly run by the funds of Government of India. Its internal sources are generating 1/3rd fund which is utilized for running the hospital.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: iii) Its governing Council has the direct control over the activities of T.M.C. The T.M.C is functioning under its own byelaws which suggest that the deep and intensive control is by the Governing Council.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: iv) The T.M.C. employees are not the Government servants;\n",
      "Paragraph 85: 39\\. It was pointed out on behalf of the appellants that Mr. Muthuswamy the Chief Administrative officer of the first respondent had admitted in his evidence that there was no interference from the Central Government in the day-to-day activities of the first respondent and they were looked after by the Directors of the T.M.C. itself. The labour categories of the employees were employed either by the Directors or by the Officers of the council. He admitted that as far as functioning and administration was concerned, the first respondent was an autonomous body.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: As laid down in the leading decisions on this issue from time to time, including the one in Steel Authority of India (supra) whether the industry is carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government is to be decided on the facts of each case.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: In view of the facts which have come on record as above, it was submitted that the judgment of the Industrial Court could not have been faulted and since it was on the 2 basis of the facts and circumstances placed on record, it was rightly left undisturbed by the learned Single Judge.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: 40\\. The judgment of the Division Bench was assailed also for laying emphasis on recital No. 6 of the agreement dated 6.1.1966 between the trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Government of India and not the subsequent clauses of that agreement. It was pointed out that in recital No. 9 of that agreement, it was proposed to amalgamate the two institutions and to entrust the control and management to the newly created body under the agreement. It was emphasized that as per clause 4 of the agreement all subsequent acquisitions shall vests in the holding trustees and clause 5 provides that the Centre shall be under the direct management and control of the Council to be created.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: 41\\. It was submitted that the appellant trade union had been recognized way- back in the year 1985 under the MRTU and PULP Act and several proceedings had been initiated by both the parties under this Act. The first respondent had thus in a way accepted that the said act does apply to it and now it cannot be permitted to contend to the contrary. It was, therefore, submitted that the Division Bench had erred in ignoring that once the society was formed and all the activities were transferred to the society, it could no longer be considered as a delegate of the Central Government and that the Division Bench seriously erred in its understanding of the law laid down by this Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: 2 Submissions on behalf of the first respondent\n",
      "Paragraph 91: 42\\. As against the submissions on behalf of the appellant, it was submitted on behalf of the first respondent that after the Hospital was dedicated to the nation, at all material times the first respondent functioned under the authority of the Central Government. The Tata Memorial Hospital set up by Sir Dorabji Tata Trust was dedicated to the nation and the control thereof was taken over by the Government of India with effect from 1.4.1957 by virtue of the agreement between the two dated 4.2.1957. After the decree was passed by the City Civil Court on 27.3.1957 and the scheme was approved, all the properties of the Hospital came to be vested in the Government of India. The Tata Memorial Centre finds a specific place in the rules of allocation of business framed by the President of India and it is stated to be under the Department of Atomic Energy. In the treatment of the disease of cancer radiation and Isotopes produced by the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre are required to be used and they are made available by the Department of Atomic Energy. Although the society is created to run the administration of the first respondent, under clause 4 of the agreement dated 6.1.1966, the properties of the Tata Memorial Hospital and Research Centre which were vested in the Government by decree dated 22.3.1957 continue to be vested in the Government of India. It is therefore, submitted that the Division Bench was correct in the view taken by it that the first respondent society continued to function as the delegate of the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: 2 43\\. The first respondent and the Division Bench emphasized the recital No.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: 6 of the agreement dated 6.1.1966 and the relevant portion of the Decree and the scheme;\n",
      "Paragraph 94: The recital No. 6 reads as follows:- \"6\\. AND WHEREAS the Trustees of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust being desirous of dedicating this Hospital to the Nation with all its assets including the Cancer Infirmary Fund and the Three plots Nos. 107, 108 and 109 of scheme No. 60, Naigaum Estate, requested the Government of India to take over the control and management of the said Hospital with effect from the First day of April One Thousand Nine Hundred and Fifty Seven and the Manage the same at their own expense as from the said date onwards upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement made on the Fourth Day of February One Thousand Nine Hundred and Fifty Seven (hereinafter called the Hospital Agreement).\"\n",
      "Paragraph 95: 44\\. The part of the decree emphasized is as follows:- AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that the properties to be conveyed, transferred and assigned by the Trustees to the Government of India being the immovable properties particularly described in Schedule B hereto and they are hereby vested in the Government of India\"\n",
      "Paragraph 96: The relevant part of the scheme reads thus:- \"The Trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust shall hand over to the Government of India and the Government of India shall take over the control and management of the Tata Memorial Hospital and shall manage the same at their own expenses as and from 1st April 1957.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 97: 45\\. Tests emerging for determining whether the industry is carried on under the authority of the Central Government or the State Government Having seen the statutory framework it is clear that when it comes to an industry governed under the [Industrial Disputes Act 1947], to be covered under 3 the MRTU and PULP Act, the State Government has to be the `appropriate government' in relation to any industrial dispute concerning such industry. As provided in Section 2 (3) of the MRTU and PULP Act, we have to fall back on the definitions of `industry' and `appropriate government' under the Industrial Disputes Act 1947. As per the scheme of Section 2 (a) of the [Industrial Disputes Act], for the industrial disputes concerning the industries specified in sub-section (i), and for the industries which are carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government, the Central Government is the appropriate government. Section 2 (a) (ii) provides that `in relation to any other industrial dispute' the State Government is the `appropriate government'. Therefore in an industrial disputes concerning industries, other than specified industries it becomes necessary to examine whether the industry is carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government. When it does not fall under either of the two categories, the State Government will be the appropriate government.\n",
      "Paragraph 98: 46\\. It is also material to note that this exercise is to be done basically in the context of an industrial dispute to find out as to whether in relation to any industrial dispute concerning that industry, Central Government is the `appropriate government' or the State Government is the `appropriate government'. Oxford dictionary defines word `concerning' as `involving' or `about'. The word `concerning', according to Webster's Dictionary means `relating to', `regarding' or `respecting' proximate, intimate and real connection with the establishment. It is to be noted that the Industrial Dispute Act is an act for investigation and settlement of industrial 3 disputes and the MRTP and PULP Act 1971 is for recognition of trade unions for facilitating collective bargaining for certain undertakings with which we are concerned in the present matter, and for prevention of certain unfair practices amongst other objectives. This being the position it is to be noted that the examination of the issue as to which government is the `appropriate government' is to be carried out in this context.\n",
      "Paragraph 99: 47\\. As far as an industry `carried on by the Central Government' is concerned, there need not be much controversy inasmuch as it would mean the industries such as the Railways or Post and Telegraph, which are carried on departmentally by the Central Government itself. The difficulty arises while deciding the industry which is carried on, not by but `under the authority of the Central Government'. Now, as has been noted above, in the Constitution Bench Judgment in Steel Authority of India Limited (supra), the approach of the different Benches in four earlier judgments has been specifically approved and the view expressed in Air India (supra) has been disagreed with. The phrase `under the authority' has been interpreted in Heavy Engineering (Supra), to mean `pursuant to the authority' such as where an agent or servant acts under authority of his principal or master. That obviously cannot be said of a company incorporated under the Companies Act, as laid down in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union case (supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 100: However, where a statute setting up a corporation so provides specifically, it can easily be identified as an agent of the State. The Judgment in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Sangh observed that the inference that a corporation was an agent of the 3 Government might also be drawn where it was performing in substance governmental and non commercial function. The Constitution Bench in Steel Authority case (supra) has disagreed with this view in para 41 of its judgment.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: Hence, even a corporation which is carrying on commercial activities can also be an agent of the state in a given situation. Heavy Engineering Judgment is otherwise completely approved wherein, it is made clear that the fact that the members or directors of corporation and he is entitled to call for information, to give directions regarding functioning which are binding on the directors and to supervise over the conduct of the business of the corporation does not render the corporation an agent of the Government. The fact that entire capital is contributed by the Central Government and wages and salaries are determined by it, was also held to be not relevant.\n",
      "Paragraph 102: 48\\. In Hindustan Aeronautics the fact that the industrial dispute had arisen in West Bengal and that the `appropriate government' in the instant case for maintaining industrial peace was West Bengal was held to be relevant for the Governor of West Bengal to refer the dispute for adjudication. In Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor case the fact that the authorized controller was appointed by the Central Government to supervise the undertaking was, held as not making any difference.\n",
      "Paragraph 103: The fact that he was to work under the directions of the Central Government was held not to render the industrial undertaking an agent of the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: 49\\. In Food Corporation of India (supra), inspite of the fact that FCI is a specified industry under Section 2 (i) (a) of the ID Act 1947, this Court considered 3 the definition of `appropriate government' in CLRA Act 1970, and the State Governments were held to be the `appropriate governments' for the regional offices and the warehouses situated in various states wherein the demand for regularization of the services under the CLRA Act had arisen.\n",
      "Paragraph 105: 50\\. The propositions in Steel Authority are to be seen on this background viz. that merely because the government companies / corporations and societies are discharging public functions and duties that does not by itself make them agents of the Central or the State Government. The industry or undertaking has to be carried under the authority of the Central Government or the State Government. That authority may be conferred either by a statute or by virtue of a relationship of principle and agent, or delegation of power. When it comes to conferring power by statute, there is not much difficulty. However, where it is not so, and whether the undertaking is functioning under authority it is a question of fact. It is to be decided on the facts and circumstances of each case.\n",
      "Paragraph 106: 51\\. Application of these tests to the facts of the present case.\n",
      "Paragraph 107: As far as the facts of the present case are concerned, as can be seen from the submissions of the parties, the determination of the question as to which Government is the appropriate Government for the first respondent - establishment, will depend upon two issues - (1) How is the property of the first respondent vested? and (2) Whether the control and management of the Hospital and the Research Centre is independently with the first respondent? 3 52\\. How is the property of the first respondent vested.\n",
      "Paragraph 108: As can be seen from the facts, which have come on record, the Tata Memorial Hospital was set up by Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. It was being maintained out of the funds of the Trust itself as well as from the grants made over by the Central Government as well as by the State Government. The Indian Cancer Research Centre was set up by the joint collaboration of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Central Government by an agreement dated 07.10.1953. The initial grant for the Center was given by the Central Government and it was meeting the expenses of the Centre though it was set up on the land belonging to the Trust. In 1957 Sir Dorabji Tata Trust decided to dedicate to the nation the property on which the Tata Memorial Centre stands. An agreement was entered in that year between the trustees and the Central Government. The control and the management of the hospital was transferred to the Central Government and a vesting order was passed in the same year to that effect by the City Civil Court in appropriate proceedings. In the year 1966, the Central Government and the Dorabji Tata Trust entered into an agreement by virtue of which Tata Memorial Hospital and the Indian Cancer Research Centre were amalgamated and the first respondent society was created and the administration and the management of the Centre was vested in the Governing Council of the said Society. The first respondent \\- Centre was registered as a Society under the [Societies Registration Act, 1860] as well as under the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950.\n",
      "Paragraph 109: 3\n",
      "Paragraph 110: 53\\. The first respondent heavily relied upon the test of vesting of the property as the main criterion for ascertaining as to who controls the first respondent for the purpose of deciding as to which Government is the Appropriate Government. It was emphasized that under the agreement of 1957, the Dorabji Tata Trust handed over the property to the Central Government and that vesting had been continued in the agreement of 1966 also. It is, however, to be noted that as per this very agreement, the future acquisitions were to vest in the Governing Council of the Society. Rule - 26 of the Rules and Regulations of the first respondent - Society provides that all properties and funds of the Centre (except the immovable properties as specified) vest in the council:\n",
      "Paragraph 111: \"26\\. Properties and Funds vested in the Council: Except the existing immovable properties of the Centre and such immovable properties as may be vested in the Holding Trustees, all the other properties of the Centre shall vest in the Council and more particularly the following:\n",
      "Paragraph 112: (a) recurring and non-recurring grants made by Government;\n",
      "Paragraph 113: (b) other grants, donations and gifts (periodical or otherwise), other than those intended to form the corpus of the property and funds of the Centre or held for the benefit of the Centre by the Holding Trustees.;\n",
      "Paragraph 114: (c) the income derived from the immovable properties and the income of the funds vested in the Holding Trustees and income of the funds vested in the Council and also fees, subscription and other annual receipts; and (d) all plant and machinery, equipment and instruments (whether medical, surgical, laboratory, workshop or of any other kind), books and journals, furniture, furnishings and fixtures belonging to the Centre.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 115: 54\\. However, even when it comes to the immovable properties, Section - 5 of the [Societies Registration Act] provides for deemed vesting of the properties 3 belonging to a society into the Governing Body of such society. Section - 5 of the [Societies Registration Act] reads as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 116: \"5.Property of society how vested - The property, movable or immovable, belonging to a society registered under this Act, if not vested in trustees, shall be deemed to be vested, for the time being, in the governing body of such society, and in all proceedings, civil and criminal, may be described as the property of the governing body of such society by their proper title.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 117: 55\\. In this behalf, we must keep in mind, the raison d'etre of the above referred to Section - 5 that once a trust is established and a society is registered for the administration of the trust, the statute contemplates that the society should be fully autonomous and that the lack of actual transfer of property of the trust should not prevent the governing body in its administration. Law recognizes that it would be proper to regard that as done which ought to have been done. The deeming provision creates a fictional vesting in favour of the Governing Council and not in favour of the Society or the Trust. This is also for the reason that society is not a body corporate which has also been held by this Court in the [?CITATION?] and reiterated in [?CITATION?]. Since the society cannot hold the property in its name, vesting of the property in the trustees is likely to hinder the administration of the trust property, particularly, where the trustees themselves or their legal representatives claim adversely to the trust. It is for this reason that the law vests the property belonging to the society in its Governing Body.\n",
      "Paragraph 118: 3\n",
      "Paragraph 119: 56\\. The phrase `property belonging to a person' has two general meanings (1) ownership, (2) the absolute right of user (per Martin B in Att. Gen. vs. Oxford & C. Railway Co. 31 L.J. (1862) 218 at 227) `Belonging' connotes either ownership or absolute right of user ( Wills J in [?CITATION?]). The Centre has an absolute right of user over its immovable properties which it has been exclusively exercising all throughout. Section 5 of the [Societies Registration Act] clearly declares that the property belonging to the society, meaning under its user, if not vested in the trustees shall be deemed to be vested in the Governing Council of the society. In the present case, it is nobody's case that the property remains vested in the Trustees of the Dorabji Tata Trust. It has been canvassed on behalf of the first respondent that the property is vested in the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 120: However, the Central Government has never claimed any title to the property adverse to the first respondent - Tata Memorial Centre. It is true that the property dedicated to the Tata Memorial Centre has not been transferred to the Society by the Central Government. But the fact is that it is the Governing Council of the first respondent which has been administering and controlling the day to day affairs of Tata Memorial Centre and its property funds, employment of its staff and their conditions of service. Hence, in view of the above referred to factual as well as legal scenario the first issue will have to be decided that the property dedicated to the first respondent will be deemed to be vested in the Governing Council of the first respondent - Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 121: 3\n",
      "Paragraph 122: 57\\. Whether the Control and Management of the Hospital and the Research Centre is independently with the first respondent.\n",
      "Paragraph 123: As far as the control and management are concerned, it is clear from the facts referred to above that the Central Government has the power to appoint four nominees on the Governing Council of the first respondent. We have already seen, as held in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union Case (Supra), mere power to appoint the Directors does not warrant a conclusion that the particular undertaking is a Central Government Undertaking. The question is whether the undertaking is functioning as the agent of the Central Government. In the instant case, the society was created to entrust the control and management of the Hospital and the Research Centre to the Society. Recital No.9 of the agreement of the 1966 specifically states as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 124: \"9) AND WHEREAS the Government of India and the Trustees of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust are now desirous of amalgamating the two institutions and entrusting their control and management to a society.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 125: 58\\. Consequently, Rule - 3 of the Society, which has been referred to earlier, also lays down that the administration and the management vests in the Governing Council. It is also to be noted that as per Rules and Regulation Nos.3 and 4 which have been quoted earlier, the administration and management of the Centre is vested in the Council which is declared to be an executive body of the center. As per the foreword to the bye-laws of the Tata Memorial Centre - \"the final decision on the extent of applicability of these rules to all Tata Memorial Centre employees rests with the Tata Memorial Governing Council. Its decision on the interpretation of these rules adopted for Tata Memorial Centre employees will be final\".\n",
      "Paragraph 126: 3 Thus, as per the Rules and Regulations, the entire administration and management of Tata Memorial Centre is with the Governing Council.\n",
      "Paragraph 127: 59\\. It has clearly come in the evidence of Mr.Muthusamy, the Chief Administrative Officer of the first respondent that there was no interference of the Central Government in the day to day activities of the first respondent. The decisions were taken by the directors of the first respondent itself. As can be seen from the bye-laws of the first respondent, the appointments and the service conditions were modelled on the pattern of Department of Atomic Energy, but the pay, allowances and pension, etc. are on the pattern of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, and which are fixed by the decisions of the Governing Council of the first respondent. The material and the evidence as referred to above clearly show that the entrustment of the management and control of the Hospital and the Research Centre to the Society was complete and it has been so functioning thereafter.\n",
      "Paragraph 128: 60\\. Besides, as observed in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union Case (supra), if we look to the definition of `employer' under the [Industrial Disputes Act], in a case where an industry is carried on by or under the authority of the Government, the employer is defined as the authority prescribed in this behalf or Head of the Department. In the instant case, no such authority has been prescribed, nor any head of the department notified by the Central Government. On the contrary, right from the time the society was created, its administration and management is completely under its Governing Council and it is functioning 4 independently. No contrary evidence has been produced. The evidence of Mr.\n",
      "Paragraph 129: Muthusamy, the Chief Administrative Officer of the Tata Memorial Centre establishes the independent functioning of the first respondent under its Governing Council. It is the Governing Council which has been exercising the executive powers of the employer.\n",
      "Paragraph 130: 61\\. It was then submitted that mentioning of the Tata Memorial Centre in the Rules for Allocation of Business of Government of India is a pointer to the control of the Central Government. Insofar as the Rules of business of the Government of India are concerned, they are for the purpose of allocation of business between various departments of Government of India whenever the Government of India has to take a decision. As rightly held by a Division Bench of Verma reported in 1997 (75) Indian Factories and Labour Reports Page -4 mere allocation of business under any department would not in any manner decide the issue as raised in the present case as to whether a particular industry is under the control of the Central Government. The business rules cannot be conclusive to show that any institution or organization listed under the allocation of business, would be part of any department of the Government of India. Besides, as noted in Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union (supra) even if a Minister appoints the directors, gives directions, calls information or supervises business, that will not make the industry an agent of the Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 131: 4\n",
      "Paragraph 132: 62\\. Hence we have to conclude that even on the test of control and management of the Hospital and the Centre, they are functioning independently under the 1st respondent Society. They cannot be said to be `under the control', of the Central Government. In the circumstances the State Government shall have to be held as the appropriate government for the 1st respondent for the purpose of I.D.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: Act consequently the MRTU & PULP Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 134: 63\\. It is material to note that until the present litigation, neither the Central Government nor the Dorabji Tata Trust or even the Governing Council of the first respondent ever disputed the application of the MRTU and PULP Act to the first respondent establishment. Prior to the Applications leading to the present appeal, the respondent - 1 has also filed Complaints under the MRTU and PULP Act. Neither the appellant nor the second respondent - rival union ever disputed the application of the Act. In fact, the first respondent has in a way, by its own conduct acquiesced into the application of the Act, and the appellant - Union has been recognized under the Act right from 1985.\n",
      "Paragraph 135: 64\\. In view of all these factors, it is not possible for us to sustain the judgment of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. The Division Bench has clearly erred in its consideration of the judgment in the Steel Authority of India Case. The first respondent cannot be held to be functioning under the authority of the Central Government. The State Government is therefore the appropriate Government for the respondent No. 1 for the purposes of ID Act and MRTU and PULP Act. The two Applications filed by respondent No. 2 will have to be held as 4 maintainable under MRTU and PULP Act. The order of the Industrial Court holding them to be maintainable but dismissing them on merits is held to be correct. In the circumstances, the appeal is allowed. The order passed by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court is set aside and the order passed by the Industrial Court as confirmed by the learned Single Judge, is restored. The Appeal No. 133/2002 filed by the 1st Respondent in the High Court shall stand dismissed.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: These appeals and special leave petitions are preferred against the common judgement dated 30.8.2001 passed by the Division Bench of High Court of Punjab & Haryana whereby a batch of writ petitions preferred by the applicants for allotment of industrial plots in the development scheme framed by the Union Territory, Chandigarh [shortly referred to as UTC] has been disposed of with certain directions. Different classes of allottees of industrial plots and UTC all feel aggrieved by the judgment of the High court and are before this Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: The full factual background leading to the dispute inter se between the applicants for industrial plots and UTC is required to be set out :- With a view to re-enact and modify the law in relation to the development and regulation of the new capital of Punjab at Chandigarh, Legislation by name Capital of Punjab [Development and Regulation] Act, 1952 [shortly referred to as the Act] was passed in the year 1952 vesting the State Government with legal authority to regulate the sale of building sites. In exercise of powers under the Act, rules for allotment of sites for building have been framed known as the Chandigarh Lease Hold of Sites and Building Rules, 1973 [hereinafter referred to as the Rules], which among others provide that the Administration of UTC, may demise 'sites for industries and buildings by allotment or auction.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: In accordance with the provisions of the Act and Rules mentioned above, the Administration of UTC issued an advertisement No. 1/81 on 14.4.1981 inviting applications from interested entrepreneurs seeking allotment of the industrial plots of different sizes ranging from 10 marlas to 4 kanals. Pursuant to the said advertisement, 3735 applications were received from different parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: The Screening Committee of the Administration of UTC on 16.7.1982 short-listed 339 parties for allotment of industrial plots of different sizes after studying their project reports and conducting interviews.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: The 339 successful applicants, selected for allotment of plots of different sizes, were directed to deposit 25% of the total cost of the plots. On 30.11.1982, for allotting specific plots, a draw of lots was held among 339 successful allottees. As a result of the draw of lots, 57 parties were given possession of their plots in developed industrial areas i.e. Phase-I and Phase-II. Twenty one parties took refund of their money. Seven allottees were given option for change of their plots. Remaining 254 allottees could not be given possession of the plots, allotted to them, as there were objections from the State Authorities to the industrial development of the land it being covered by the notification, issued in the year 1961, declaring area of the land as reserved forest. The Administration of UTC could not deliver the possession of that land which was covered in the reserved forest, to 254 allottees of the year 1989 but it continued to accept the yearly installments fixed for payment from the selected allottees.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: Certain allottees filed writ petitions in the year 1987 in the High Court seeking directions to the Administration of UTC to deliver possession of the industrial plots allotted to them in accordance with the short-listing done by the Screening Committee and consequent draw of lots.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: On 29.11.1990, the Director of Industries, Government of India, intimated to the allottees that the Administration of UTC was not in a position to deliver possession of the industrial plots allotted to them as the land was found to be a part of reserved forest. The Administration proposed to allot one kanal land to each allottee irrespective of the size of plot originally allotted.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: On 10.12.1990, the Administration of UTC then framed a new industrial policy to accommodate 250 allottees of 1982 who could not be given possession of the industrial plots because of the land being reserved for forest. To meet aforesaid difficult situation, the Administration decided to reduce the size of 4 kanal and 2 kanal of industrial plots by 25% so as to accommodate and to enable itself to allot plots to all 254 allottees. In view of the new industrial policy of 1990, the earlier letter dated 29.11.1990 proposing each allottee one kanal of plot was withdrawn. On 05.2.1991, a letter was issued to allottees of plots measuring 4 kanal and 2 kanal to give their consent for accepting reduced size of plot by 25% of the original plot allotted to each of them. The option was invited within a period of 30 days. No option was asked from the allottees of plots measuring one kanal and 10 marlas.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: Some allottees had given their consent who shall be hereinafter referred to shortly as 'the consentees'.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: Many others who did not give their consent for reduced size of plots challenged the action of the Administration of UTC in the High Court. The new declared industrial policy of 1990 was also challenged.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: Such allottees who did not give consent for smaller sizes of plots and approached the High Court shall be, hereinafter, referred to as 'the non- consentees'. These non-consentees in the petitions filed by them in the High Court obtained stay against the draw of lots scheduled to be held on 27.3.1991 for allotment of specific plots of smaller sizes to the consentees. The non- consentees made a three-pronged attack in the writ petitions by challenging the notification of declaring the area as reserved forest, the new industrial policy of 1990 and the decision to reduce the size of plots taken by the Administration of UTC. A single Judge of the High Court by order dated 15.11.1991 dismissed the writ petitions filed by the non-consentees. But as the Administration of UTC was found to be blameworthy for the situation created, the learned single Judge merely expressed a wish that they would be accommodated in the alternative schemes. After decision of the case by the single Judge of the High Court, the Administration of UTC on 07.2.1992 issued a letter asking all the 254 allottees to furnish an affidavit in prescribed form indicating that none of them possessed any industrial plot in the territory of Chandigarh, Panchkula or Mohali in his/her name or in the name of his/her spouses/children. This affidavit was demanded in terms of the new industrial policy of 1990. Out of 254 allottees only 161 consentees gave their affidavits. Some of the non-consentees again approached the High Court challenging the new industrial policy of 1990 by filing fresh petitions and others filed letters patent appeals. In their petitions and appeals, they insisted on grant of relief of directing delivery of possession of the original plots allotted to them. The filing of this petition and appeals resulted in stalling the allotments of alternative plots pursuant to the new industrial policy of 1990 even to consentees who had agreed for plots of reduced sizes at alternative locations and had filed affidavits in the requisite form. The consentees approached the High Court with a prayer that the Administration be directed to give them possession of the alternative plots of smaller sizes. The Division Bench of the High Court passed an order dated 22.11.1994 and by modifying its earlier order dated 13.1.1992 clarified that the Administration of UTC can proceed to allot the industrial plots to consentees subject to the condition that the plots of the size allotted to the non-consentees, who are in litigation, shall be kept reserved and not reduced. Despite the above modification and clarification made by the High Court, the Administration of UTC did not deliver possession of the plots even to consentees stating that in some other cases, stay orders against the allotments were operating against the Administration. On 12.8.1995, the High Court again modified its earlier orders and gave liberty to the Administration to give possession of alternative plots to consentees.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: Despite the above order, the Administration of UTC did not choose to deliver possession of the alternative plots even to consentees as in their view, the interim orders of the High Court restrained them from reducing the size of plots allotted to non-consentees.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: The consentees then approached by substantive petitions before the High Court seeking relief in their favour of issuing direction to the Administration of UTC to deliver possession of alternative plots to them. In response to the writ petitions filed by consentees, the Administration expressed its inability to deliver possession of the plots even to consentees. It was stated that some part of the land to be allotted as alternative plots falls within the restricted zone under the notification issued under the Aircrafts Act for Air- Force base.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: The Division Bench of the High Court, after long drawn hearing and detailed consideration of the competing claims of consentees and non-consentees as also the stand of the Administration, passed a common judgement with the directions which are subject matter of these appeals preferred by non-consentees who are aggrieved by denial to them of alternative plots. Consentees feel aggrieved by direction permitting from them demand of the price at the rate prevailing on the date of draw of lots i.e. 27.3.1991. According to the Chandigarh Administration, during long pendency of litigation, a new industrial policy of 2001 has been promulgated in which one phase of industrial area is to be reserved for setting up the Information Technology industries. The Administration is aggrieved by the directions permitting them to charge price only at the rate prevailing on the date of draw of lots i.e. 27.3.1991 and not at current rate.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: Amongst the consentees and non-consentees, there are individuals and parties who did not file any writ petitions in the High Court and as the relief granted is restricted to the parties before the court, such parties and individuals have filed applications seeking intervention and/or impleadment as parties in this group of appeals.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: The directions given by the High Court in the impugned judgment are as under :-\n",
      "Paragraph 17: 1\\. The prayer of the appellants/petitioners for directing the authorities of Chandigarh Administration to hand over possession of the plots allotted on the basis of draw held in November, 1982 is rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: 2\\. However, the authorities of Chandigarh Administration are directed to issue allotment letters to those appellants/petitioners who had given consent for allotment of alternative plots of smaller sizes and who were successful in the draw held on 27.3.1991. They should be charged price at the rate prevailing on the date of draw.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: 3\\. Those who were declared successful in the draw held on 27.3.1991 but cannot be allotted plots due to non-availability of sufficient land in the wake of prohibition imposed vide notification dated 5.1.1988 shall be allotted plots in any other scheme already framed or which may be framed hereafter by Chandigarh Administration.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: 4\\. Those who were declared successful in the draw held in 1982, but did not give consent for allotment of alternative plots shall be refunded the amount deposited by them with interest at the rate of 12% from the date of deposit till the date of actual payment.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 5\\. Within one month from the date of receipt of this order, Chandigarh Administration shall get published in the Tribune the list of the applicants who had given consent for allotment of alternative plots and were declared successful in the draw held on 27.3.1991 specifying the number of plots earmarked for them.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 6\\. Notification dated 28.4.2000 is held inapplicable and inoperative qua the allotments made to the appellants/petitioners on the basis of the draw held on 27.3.1991.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: ....................\n",
      "Paragraph 24: In this Court when the arguments commenced, it was felt by all parties involved as also by this Court that some amicable solution reasonably acceptable to all the parties can be found out on the basis of mutual discussions and negotiations between the authorities of the Chandigarh Administration, the contesting consentees and non- consentees.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: Despite giving them repeated opportunities to settle the matter through negotiations, we are unhappy to record that the counsel for the parties reported that efforts to amiably solve the issue have failed.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: Learned senior counsel Shri M. L. Verma appearing for the non- consentees very fairly stated that the notification reserving certain lands for the forest and the restrictions imposed on construction in periphery of 900 metres from the Air-Force base under the Aircrafts Act cannot be questioned and that part of the judgment of the High Court is not being assailed in these appeals. With regard to the restrictions under Aircrafts Act, it is however, pointed out that the period of restriction under notification dated 22.5.2001 has expired and therefore, the said restriction of 900 metres under the Aircrafts Act is no longer in operation.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: Learned counsel appearing for the Administration of UTC had pointed out to us that the contents of the letter dated 20.11.2003 received by the Administration from Ministry of Defence, Government of India do show that the period of notification imposing restriction has expired but it has been intimated in the same letter that the similar restriction is under contemplation and a fresh notification imposing same is likely to be issued in future. In the aforesaid circumstances, learned counsel for the Chandigarh Administration submitted that allotment of alternative plots within 900 metres would be subject to any imposition of restriction under the Aircrafts Act and if such restrictions are imposed, the allottees of plots falling in that area would have no right to claim any compensation or damage from the Administration.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: We shall take up first for consideration the grievances raised and the challenges made to the directions of the High Court by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the non-consentees. On their behalf, learned counsel states that amongst them are large number of allottees who, on having been only given letter of allotment, have paid full price of the plots. Lease-deeds have been executed in their favour and they have been placed in formal possession of the plots although they have not been allowed to take physical possession and raise super-structures. Such allottees, it is contended, have acquired a vested right to obtain the plots. Reliance is placed on section 3(3) of the Act read with rules 4, 6 & 10 of the Rules which read as under :- \"Section 3. Power of Central Government in respect of transfer of land and building in Chandigarh.  (1)..............\n",
      "Paragraph 29: (2) ...................\n",
      "Paragraph 30: (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, until the entire consideration money together with interest or any other amount, if any, due to the Central Government on account of the transfer of any site or building, or both, under sub-section (12) is paid, such site or building, or both, as the case may be, shall continue to belong to the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: Rule 4. The Chandigarh Administration may demise sites and buildings at Chandigarh on lease for 99 years. Such leases may be given by allotment or by auction in accordance with these rules.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: Rule 6. Commencement and period of lease.  The lease shall commence from the date of allotment or auction, as the case may be, and shall be for a period of 99 years. After the expiry of the said period of 99 years, the lease may be renewed for such further period and on such terms and conditions as the Government may decide.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: Rule 10. Delivery of possession.  Actual possession of the site/building shall be delivered to the lessee on payment of 25 per cent of the premium in accordance with rule 8 or rule 9 as the case may be.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: Provided that no ground rent payable under rule 13 and interest on the instalments of premium payable under sub-rule(2) of rule 12 shall be paid by the lessee till the actual and physical possession of the site/building is delivered or offered to be delivered to him, whichever is earlier.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: Some decisions, which need not detain us for consideration, were cited to contend that on execution of lease-deads, payment of price and formal delivery of possession of the plots, a vested right in law in the plots allotted has been created in favour of the allottees regardless of their consent or non- consent for alternative plots.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: We have examined the scheme and provisions of the Act and the Rules. They do not seem to contemplate creation of any vested right where any other state or central legislation bars use of a particular land for industrial development. The Chandigarh Administration, in these cases, had prepared a scheme, carved out plots, auctioned them and received part or full payment of the price. In implementing its development scheme, it ignored the notification issued reserving a major portion of the land covered by the scheme as 'forest'. It is in this circumstance that the Administration is showing its inability to honour the commitment made by offering the plots, acceptance of price and giving delivery of possession. When a scheme of development of land and the allotments made thereunder are found to be in contravention of any law and contrary to general public interest, no claim based on so called vested right can be countenanced. Similar is the position with regard to 900 metres restriction imposed under the Aircrafts Act. No citizen can be allowed to claim any vested right which would result in violation of a statutory provision of law or Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: The claim, therefore, based on alleged vested right, has to be outright rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: The learned senior counsel then made some attempts to rely on the doctrines of 'promissory estoppel' and 'legitimate expectation'.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: Doctrine of 'legitimate expectation' has developed as a principle of reasonableness and fairness and is used against statutory bodies and government authorities on whose representations or promises, parties or citizens act and some detrimental consequences ensue because of refusal of authorities to fulfil their promises or honour their commitments. The argument under the label of 'estoppel' and 'legitimate expectation' are substantially the same. The Administration herein no doubt is guilty of gross mistake in including in its development scheme, a portion of land covered by the forest and land with restrictions under the Aircrafts Act. A vital mistake has been committed by the Chandigarh Administration in overlooking the notification reserving land under the Forest Act and the restrictions imposed under the Aircrafts Act, but overriding public interest outweighs the obligation of a promise or representation made on behalf of the Administration. Where public interest is likely to be harmed, neither the doctrine of 'legitimate expectation' nor 'estoppel' can be allowed to be pressed into service by any citizen against the State Authorities. In [?CITATION?], a two-Judge Bench of this Court by explaining and distinguishing [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?], observed thus :- 'It is only in public interest that it is recognized that an authority acting on behalf of the government or by virtue of statutory powers cannot exceed his authority. Rule of ultra vires will become applicable when he exceeds his authority and the government would not be bound by such action. Any person who enters into an arrangement with the government has to ascertain and satisfy himself that the authority who purports to act for the government, acts within the scope of his authority and cannot urge that the government is in the position of any other litigant liable to be charged with liability'.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: In the aforesaid case of M/s Jit Ram Shiv Kumar (supra), the Municipal Committee of Bahadurgarh town to develop a Mandi promised that the traders who purchase plots in Mandi would be exempted from paying octroi duty on goods imported for trade to the Mandi. The State Government in exercise of powers under the Punjab Municipal Act directed the Municipal Committee to withdraw the exemption from payment of octroi duty. When the traders, who had set up their business in the Mandi on promise of getting exemption from octroi duty, challenged the action of the Municipality and the Punjab Government and raised on plea of 'estoppel'  it was rejected by this Court by relying on the decision of Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] This Court in M/s Jit Ram Shiv Kumar (Supra), recorded the following conclusion which supports the view we propose to take in the circumstances of the present case :- 'On a consideration of the decisions of this Court, it is clear that there can be no 'promissory estoppel' against the exercise of legislative power of the State. So also the doctrine cannot be invoked for preventing the government from acting in discharge of its duty under the law. The government would not be bound by the act of is officers and agents who act beyond the scope of their authority and a person dealing with the agent of the government must be held to have notice of the limitations of his authority. The court can enforce compliance by a public authority of the obligation laid on him if he arbitrarily or on his mere whim ignores the promises made by him on behalf of the government. It would be open to the authority to plead and prove that there were special considerations which necessitated his not being able to comply with his obligations in public interest'.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: In public law in certain situations, relief to the parties aggrieved by action or promises of public authorities can be granted on the doctrine of 'legitimate expectation' but when grant of such relief is likely to harm larger public interest, the doctrine cannot be allowed to be pressed into service. We may usefully call in aid Legal Maxim :\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 'Salus populi est suprema lex : regard for the public welfare is the highest law. This principle is based on the implied agreement of every member of society that his own individual welfare shall in cases of necessity yield to that of community. His property, liberty and life shall under certain circumstances be placed in jeopardy or even sacrificed for the public good'.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: On the same principle and to protect larger public interest, the Chandigarh Administration can be relieved of fulfilling legitimate expectation arising from its allotment of plots on the ground that their development schemes under consideration have been found to be in contravention of Forest Act and Aircrafts Act. Another legal maxim which can be invoked to their aid is : 'Lex non cogit ad impossibilia :\n",
      "Paragraph 44: the law does not compel a man to do that which he cannot possibly perform'.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: The allottees of the plots are, no doubt, faced with an uncertain situation with loss already caused to them due to negligence and mistake on the part of the Planning Authorities of the Chandigarh Administration. In preparing the development scheme, the existing notification reserving major part of land as forest under the Indian Forest Act and restriction on construction in periphery of 900 metres from the Air-force base under the Aircrafts Act were overlooked. As we have held above, on a representation that the land is available for allotment of industrial plots, the allottees staked their money and plans for setting up their industries. The representations made to them by the Planning Authorities have turned out to be misleading as a substantial part of the land could not have been included in the development scheme. The allottees paid price for the plots and incurred expenses in preparing their industrial projects. We have held above that the doctrine of 'legitimate expectation' and 'estoppel' cannot be applied against the Administration to compel it to allot the original plots because that would be permitting violation of Statutes intended to conserve forest and restrictions imposed in the interests of general public and security of Nation under Aircrafts Act. Doctrine of 'estoppel' cannot, therefore, be allowed to be urged against the Administration. This Court cannot direct the Administration to commit breach of statutory provisions and thus harm general public interests.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: De Smith, Woolf and Jowell in their authoritative book on 'Judicial Review of Administration Action' [5th Edition at page 565 para 13-028], have stated one of the principles of public law powers thus : 'A public body with limited powers cannot bind itself to act outside of its authorised powers; and if it purports to do so it can repudiate its undertaking, for it cannot extend its powers by creating an estoppel'.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: Surely, the doctrine of estoppel cannot be applied against public authorities when their mistaken advice or representation is found to be in breach of a Statute and therefore, against general public interest.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: The question, however, is whether the parties or individuals, who had suffered because of the mistake and negligence on the part of the statutory public authorities, would have any remedy of redressal for the loss they have suffered. The 'rules of fairness' by which every public authority is bound, requires them to compensate loss occasioned to private parties or citizens who were misled in acting on such mistaken or negligent advice of the public Authority. There are no allegations and material in these cases to come to a conclusion that the action of the authorities was mala fide. It may be held to be careless or negligent. In some of the English cases, the view taken is that the public authorities cannot be absolved of their liability to provide adequate monetary compensation to the parties who are adversely affected by their erroneous decisions and actions. But in these cases, any directions to the public authorities to pay monetary compensation or damages would also indirectly harm general public interest. The public authorities are entrusted with public fund raised from public money. The funds are in trust with them for utilisation in public interest and strictly for the purposes of the Statute under which they are created with specific statutory duties imposed on them. In such a situation when a party or citizen has relied, to his detriment, on an erroneous representation made by public authorities and suffered loss and where doctrine of 'estoppel' will not be invoked to his aid, directing administrative redressal would be a more appropriate remedy than payment of monetary compensation for the loss caused by non- delivery of the possession of the plots and consequent delay caused in setting up industries by the allottees.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: [See the Administrative Law by H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth, Eight Edition at pages 370-373. Also the book on 'Judicial Review of Administration Action' by De Smith, Woolf and Jowell, 5th Edition at page 565 para 13-028].\n",
      "Paragraph 50: In the predicament aforesaid, the Administration has adopted a fair attitude. It has come out with a proposal to give alternative plots but of smaller sizes because of the paucity of land available in development schemes in Phase-I & II. The statutory compulsion and the rule of fairness have both to be evenly balanced. This Court cannot allow the Administration to commit breach of law and harm public interest. At the same time, it cannot be absolved of its liability to give appropriate redressal and compensation to the parties and citizens who have suffered loss because of their grossly mistaken decisions and actions. The allottees of the plots, when they were given option to accept alternative plots of smaller sizes, ought to have accepted the offer being the appropriate compensation to them in the circumstances obtaining. The allottees who have consented to accept alternative plots even of smaller sizes and others who did not consent, maybe, because they were in litigation and required plots of bigger sizes, constitute two different groups requiring different treatment in the matter of directing grant of appropriate redressal to them by the Administration.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: The learned counsel on behalf of non-consentees submitted that in denying choice of alternative plots to non-consentees at par with consentees, the High Court unreasonably discriminated the non- consentees. It is submitted that the non-consentees were legitimately fighting for their rights for the original plots allotted of required sizes and which suited to their industrial projects. Merely because in the course of court proceedings, draw of lots for alternative plots were stayed and held up, is no ground to deny non-consentees the allotment of alternative plots, when in many of their cases, full prices have been paid, lease-deeds executed and even formal possessions have been obtained although they could not set up industries. It is submitted that the rule of fairness requires consentees and non- consentees be treated at par for allotment of alternative plots. No prejudicial treatment could be meted out to non-consentees by completely depriving them of alternative plots and merely directing refund of their prices. In this respect, it is urged that pendency of court proceedings should harm no one and mere approach to the law courts for enforcement of their legal and constitutional rights should not be taken as a circumstance against the parties. The contention advanced is that discrimination between consentees and non- consentees is violative of right of equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: We have also heard the learned senior counsel Shri M. N.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: Krishnamani appearing for the consentees, who has very stiffly opposed the claim for alternative plots advanced on behalf of the non- consentees. The plots of small sizes are limited in number in which both consentees and non- consentees cannot be accommodated.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: Learned counsel submits that differential treatment given to consentees and non-consentees by the High Court is fully justified for various reasons. It is submitted that the writ petitions filed by the non- consentees challenging the notification of reservation of land for forest and their refusal to accept alternative plots of smaller sizes, occasioned long delay in making available the alternative plots to all.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: The consentees had to intervene and fight independently in the High Court as also in this Court to obtain possession of the plots which they could have obtained on the basis of their consent and draw of lots on 27.3.1991. It is submitted that non-consentees were mainly responsible for stalling actions of the Administration and attempts by them to accommodate as much number of allottees in the alternative plots as was possible on the basis of availability of developed land and the size of plots. They submitted that the non-consentees having entered into a long drawn litigation against the Administration and failed, they cannot now, for the first time in this Court, be allowed to change their stand and compete with consentees in draw of lots for smaller sizes of available alternate plots. The High Court, therefore, was right in completely excluding the non-consentees from being considered for grant of alternative plots. The other grievances raised on behalf of the consentees is with regard to direction no. 2 in the judgment of the High Court by which the consentees have been directed to be allotted alternative plots under draw of lots held on 27.3.1991 but on the price prevailing on the date of the draw of lots.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: This part of the direction no. 2 of the High Court is questioned on behalf of the consentees by stating that they had paid full or part price for the original plots as allotted to them in the year 1982 and the said money was throughout with the Administration. Now directing the consentees to pay the price for the alternative plots on the price prevailing on the date of draw i.e. 27.3.1991 is prima facie unfair and highly burdensome because the consentees for no fault on their part are made to pay much higher price. The Administration despite their vital mistake in preparing schemes for the land partly covered by reserved forest should not be allowed enrichment by allowing them to charge higher price for smaller sizes of plots in the same scheme or the alternative schemes.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: We have heard learned senior counsel Shri Rakesh Dwivedi assisted by Ms. Kamini Jaiswal appearing for the Administration on the question of charging of price for alternative plots of smaller sizes in the same scheme or the other schemes. The justification advanced for demanding higher price is that in the course of long drawn litigation, additional expenditure was required to be incurred for replotting and prices of land have gone up in the meantime. It is also submitted that it may not be possible to accommodate all consentees even for smaller sizes of plots in the same scheme. Some of them will have to be accommodated in other schemes. The acquisition cost of land in other schemes is higher. The direction of the High Court to charge from the consentees for alternative plots, price as was prevailing on the date of draw of lots held on 27.3.1991 is, therefore, described as highly unreasonable.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: After considering the rival submissions made on behalf of various parties, we are of the view that the rule of reasonableness and fairness by which every statutory authority is bound, demands that the consentees, who, for no fault on their part, were deprived of the original plots of larger sizes, should not be further made to suffer by demanding from them higher price for the alternative plots of smaller sizes. It would be highly iniquitous to demand from them higher price for smaller sizes of plots and add to their losses caused by undue delay in setting up their industries. The Administration is mainly to be blamed for the situation in which the allottees of plots find themselves today. In preparing scheme and allotting plots, it could not have ignored the notification reserving a part of land for the forest and the restriction to the extent of 900 metres around the Air-Force base. The allottees of the plots have paid full or part price and that amount throughout remained with the Administration. In such circumstances, the Administration must bear a portion of loss, if any, occasioned to it and compensate to some extent the loss caused to the consentees who never objected to allotment of alternative plots of smaller sizes.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: The direction no. 2 of the High Court, therefore, to the extent of charging price from the consentees as prevailing on the date of draw of lots i.e. 27.3.1991, deserves to be set aside and substituted with the directions that the consentees on being allotted a particular plot of smaller size shall be charged the same price which was prevailing at the time of original allotment of the plot in their favour. Necessary adjustment or refund of price, as the case may be, shall be given to them for the small size of plot allotted.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: So far as the non-consentees are concerned, we are not prepared to accept that by their action and/or inaction, they can claim parity for allotment with the consentees. The consentees have to be considered in priority as, at the first available opportunity, they agreed to the offer of alternative plots of smaller sizes. The non-consentees not only questioned the offer made by the Administration to provide them plots of smaller sizes but even assailed the government notification declaring major part of the land in the scheme as reserved forest. They might have a legitimate right to approach the courts for necessary reliefs but having failed in their challenges in the court, they can claim no right of being treated similarly with consentees who right from the earliest opportunity were willing and trying through the Administration and the court for early allotment of alternative plots.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: The consentees and the non-consentees, on the basis of their actions and inactions, constitute two different classes of allottees and a differential treatment to them cannot be held to be unjustified or in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. On a just and reasonable ground, the consentees deserve a more favourable treatment than non-consentees more so because plots of small sizes available in the existing scheme in Phase-I & II are extremely limited in number.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: After mutual negotiations for settlement between the allottees and the Administration failed, the Assistant Estate Officer, Chandigarh Administration has filed a detailed affidavit on 16.2.2004 showing the latest position with regard to the availability of alternative plots in the same scheme in phase-I & II for which the original allotments were made and in the new scheme in phase-III in Mouli Jagran. We have to proceed on the facts mentioned in the latest affidavit dated 16.2.2004 filed on behalf of the Administration. It is necessary to briefly indicate the facts and developments which have been brought to our notice in the affidavit and the proposals now made on behalf of the Administration to accommodate the consentees and non-consentees.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: In the affidavit, it has been stated that after the order dated 17.9.2003 of this Court, parties involved in the litigation were invited before a committee in meetings held between 3.10.2003 to 12.12.2003. Other 164 applicants who were also parties to the draw of lots on 27.3.1991 and some of whom are intervenors or seeking impleadments as parties were also invited as a measure personnel to them. In accordance with the new industrial policy of 1990, the parties in the court were required to furnish necessary information in the prescribed form as to whether in their own name or in the name of their spouses and children they own any plot in Mohali, Panchkula and in the Union Territory of Chandigarh. The second information demanded was whether the applicant is a government or semi- government employee because there is prohibition for allotment of plot to such employees.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: In the affidavit, it is further stated that, in accordance with the new industrial policy, the environmental restrictions have been imposed categorising different industrial projects into three categories i.e. Red, Orange and Green. In accordance with the environmental norms, in the new industrial policy of 1990, the parties litigating were given option to submit their fresh project reports. Some of the parties neither provided necessary information on affidavit nor submitted their revised project reports conforming to the environmental norms.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: According to the Administration, allotments are possible only to such parties who fulfil the conditions shown in the prescribed affidavit and conform to environmental norms. On the basis of the information received in the course of the mutual negotiations for settlement, it is reported to this Court that 47 projects fall in red category and 4 projects fall in orange category. These projects cannot be considered to be set up as per the prevalent pollution norms. They can be considered if they submit fresh project reports which comply with the latest environmental/pollution norms and are viable in the existing marketing conditions. It has been stated on affidavit by the Administration that out of 35 consentees who have furnished the necessary information, only 23 consentees are fulfilling the laid down criteria. The names of those 23 allottees with full details are shown in paragraph no. 7 of the affidavit and the names and details of other 12 consentee allottees who did not furnish complete information and do not fulfil the requisite conditions are also given in the same paragraph of the affidavit.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: In the affidavit, there is a second category shown by the Administration as comprising such allottees from whom consent was not asked for as it was proposed to allot them the same size of plot measuring one kanal which they had applied for. In this category, from whom no consent was needed, are allottees of one kanal of plots.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: Thirteen applicants have been found to have given complete information and fulfilling requisite environmental norms. Their names are also mentioned under category-II of the affidavit.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: We have stated above that there is no justification for the non- consentees to claim parity with consentees. The third category pointed out by the Administration and some of whom are also before us represented through their counsel are allottees of one kanal of plots.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: They are being offered same size of alternative plots and from them no consent was asked for. This category of allottees of one kanal of plot are also required to be accommodated in the available alternative plots.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: On this identification of 23 consentees and 13 allottees of one kanal of plot each, the Administration is justifiably required to consider their cases to allot them alternative plots available in industrial areas phase-I and phase- II as shown in their chart (Annnexure-A) annexed to their affidavit. This chart (annexure-A) annexed to the affidavit shall be read as part of our order and is reproduced as under :- ANNEXURE  A LIST OF INDUSTRIAL PLOTS LYING VACANT IN THE INDUSTRIAL AREA, PHASE I & II, CHANDIGARH.\n",

The directions made by the High Court in favour of the consentees are, therefore, required to be suitably modified with additional directions which we propose to make in these batch of cases :- So far as non-consentees are concerned, we have already held above that they can claim no parity with the consentees and allottees of one kanal of plots. The number of plots of smaller sizes are also limited and therefore, the non-consentees cannot be allowed to compete with consentees and allottees of plot of one kanal.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: In the latest affidavit submitted by the Administration mentioned above, it has been stated that 152 acres of land has been acquired in the Revenue Estate of village Mouli Jagran and Raipur Kalan which fall entirely outside the reserved forest area and are being developed as industrial area phase-III. According to the Administration since alternative sites available in industrial areas phase-I & II as mentioned in annexure-A are limited, all other left-out allottees can be accommodated in industrial area phase-III. The Administration has, however, stated that in the new industrial zone Mouli Jagran, the cost of acquisition and development has been much higher calculated at Rs.2,892 per sq. yard. Based on the above affidavit, the only relief that can be granted to the non-consentees would be to permit them to submit their willingness within a period of one month from the date of our order in writing to the Administration to be considered for allotment of a suitable plot in the new industrial zone i.e. Mouli Jagran but at the price prevailing on the date of such fresh allotment.\n",

They were not parties before the High Court and were invited to participate in the discussions and negotiations which have taken place during pendency of these cases before us. They have approached by way of special leave petitions or applications seeking interventions or impleadment as parties in the present cases. This group of individuals and parties, who were not parties before the High Court either as petitioners or respondents and who are merely intervenors or parties seeking impleadments and/or have sought permission to file special leave petitions cannot be allowed to join race for allotment of available alternative plots. It will have to be presumed that having not ventilated their grievances and enforced their rights, if any, at any earlier stage, they have abandoned their claims. Merely because during pendency of court proceedings, some rounds of negotiations and discussions took place in which the Administration also invited them, would not furnish them a cause of action to raise their claims which they had earlier given up by their inaction and lapse. In adjusting equities and on rule of fairness, those who have languished and slept over their rights have to be denied any relief more so when there has been such a time lag between the original allotment and the proposed allotment of alternative plots. In the meantime, there have been various developments including escalation of land prices. Any speculative deals and attempt to take chance of getting allotment by such parties have to be discouraged. We, therefore, refuse to grant any relief to remaining class of consentees or non-consentees and other allottees who were not parties in the litigation before the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: As a result of detailed discussion aforesaid, the appeals and connected matters are disposed of by partly maintaining the directions contained in the impugned order of the High Court but with the modifications, substitution and addition of directions as mentioned below :-\n",
      "Paragraph 82: 1\\. The prayer of the appellants/petitioners for directing the authorities of Chandigarh Administration to hand over possession of the plots allotted on the basis of draw held in November, 1982 is rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: 2\\. The total available plots of different sizes as mentioned in Annexure-A to the affidavit of the Administration of UTC, shall be allotted by draw of lots separately or jointly as per the procedure evolved by the Administration to 23 consentees found eligible in accordance with the new environmental norms and to 13 allottees of one kanal plot. It is for the Administration of UTC to work out the manner in which draw of lots will be held between 23 consentees and 13 allottees of one kanal plot for the available number of plots of different sizes as contained in Annexure-A to the affidavit. It is made clear that the Administration of UTC will have liberty, keeping in view the industrial projects submitted by the consentees and other restrictions, if they make it necessary, to suitably alter the sizes of plots to accommodate the identified 23 consentees. It is clarified that allotment of plots from the area of the scheme which falls within restricted 900 metres zone from the air-base under Aircrafts Act, would be granted by the Administration with a condition that if in future, any such restriction is reimposed, the allotments may be cancelled and there would be no liability on the Administration of UTC to pay any damage or compensation to the parties due to non-utilisation of plots or its cancellation. If the allotments of plots in the restricted zone are cancelled due to restriction aforesaid, the price paid for the plots shall be refunded to the parties concerned without any liability of interest on the price which remained as deposit with the Administration.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: 3\\. The consentees and allottees of one kanal plot, who even though found eligible for allotment, because of limited number of plots (as mentioned in annexure-A), do not get accommodation in the available plots, they be considered on the same price paid by them for alternative plots in the new industrial area phase-III i.e. Mouli Jagran. It is made clear that the requirement of the Act and the Rules and the new environmental norms as existing on the date of fresh allotment of plots in the industrial area phase- III would be made applicable to such consentees and allottees of one kanal plot.\n",
      "Paragraph 85: 4\\. The non-consentees shall be granted by the Administration of UTC, option by asking them to submit their willingness in writing within a period of one month from the date of this order for considering allottment to each of them a suitable plot in the new industrial zone Phase III at Mouli Jagran. It is left to the Administration of UTC to evolve a fair and just method of allotment by draw of lots in accordance with the Act and the Rules. It is made clear that the allotment of plots in the new industrial area III i.e. Mouli Jagran would be at the price prevailing on the date of fresh allotments. The price already paid by the non-consentees for their original plots, if so far not refunded to them, shall be adjusted towards the total price payable for the new sites. It is also made clear that in accordance with existing industrial policy and the environmental norms, the allottees will have to submit their project reports for considering viability of their proposed industries by the Administration.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: In the event, the non-consentees are unwilling to take plots in the new industrial zone phase III or their project reports are ultimately found to be not approvable, the price deposited by them for the original plots would be refunded to them with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of initial deposit.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: 5\\. The reliefs in the nature of directions made in favour of consentees and non-consentees and allottees of one kanal plot are restricted only to such of them who were parties before the High Court. All claims of remaining consentees or non-consentees or allottees of one kanal plot, who were not parties in the cases before the High Court, stand rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: 6\\. Notification dated 28.4.2000 containing new Industrial Policy would not be made applicable to the allottees of plots in phase-I & II who are successful in fresh draw of lots to be held under the above directions.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: 7\\. The Administration of UTC shall complete the requisite formalities and carry out the directions made above in accordance with law within a period of four months from the date of this order and hand over possession of the plots to the successful allottees.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: 8\\. All applications seeking interventions, impleadment as parties and special leave petitions filed by parties, who were not parties before the High Court, are, hereby, rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: As a result of the discussion aforesaid, the appeals and connected matters are disposed of by substituting/modifying above- mentioned directions for the directions contained in the impugned order of the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: Keeping in view the peculiar circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs which shall be borne by the parties as incurred by them. \n"

      "Paragraph 1: Challenge in this writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the 'Constitution') is to the order passed by Government of Andhra Pradesh, represented by its Principal Secretary whereby Gowru Venkata Reddy-respondent No.2 was granted remission of unexpired period of about seven years imprisonment. GOMs. No.170 dated 11.8.2005 in this regard is challenged.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: Factual scenario as per petitioners is as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Petitioner No.1 is the son of late Sh. Epuru Chinna Ramasubbaiah who was murdered along with another person on 19.10.1995. Petitioner No.2 claims to be the son of one late Sh. Tirupati Reddy who was allegedly murdered by respondent No.2 while he was on bail in the murder case of father of petitioner No.1. In the case relating to the murder of late Sh.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: Epuru Chinna Ramasubbaiah and one Ambi Reddy, respondent No.2 faced trial and ultimately the matter came before this Court in Criminal Appeal Nos. 519-521 of 2003 which was disposed of by this Court by judgment dated 19.11.2003 and the conviction of respondent No.2 was altered from one under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the 'IPC') to Section 304(1) read with Section 109 IPC and custodial sentence of 10 years' rigorous imprisonment was imposed. Conviction relating to some other sentences was maintained. On 28.5.2003, the respondent No.3 wife of respondent No.2 submitted a representation for grant of parole to respondent No.2 and on 18.10.2003 parole was granted for a period of 15 days but the same was cancelled on 30.10.2003 by the State Government in view of the report sent by Superintendent of Police, Kurnool that on account of respondent No.2's release on parole there was a likelihood of breach of peace and law and order if the respondent No.2 visits Nandikotkur Assembly Constituency. Respondent No.3 contested the election to the Andhra Pradesh Assembly Election and on 12.5.2004 was elected as member of Legislative Assembly. On 14.5.2004 she made a representation for grant of parole to respondent No.2. Same was granted on 19.5.2004 and was extended from time to time. On 18.7.2004 fourth extension for 15 days was granted. On 10.10.2004 respondent No.3 made a representation to respondent No.1 seeking pardon to respondent No.2 by exercise of power under Article 161 of the Constitution alleging that he was implicated in false cases due to political rivalry. On 18.10.2004 during the pendency of the petition for pardon, one month parole was granted. On 11.8.2005 the Governor of Andhra Pradesh purportedly exercised power under Article 161 of the Constitution and granted remission of the unexpired sentence of respondent No.2. Director General and Inspector General of Police (Correction Services) Andhra Pradesh were directed to take action for release of respondent No.2 and in fact on 12.8.2005 the Superintendent of Central Prison, Cherlapally, R.R. District directed release of respondent No.2.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: The writ petition has been filed inter alia alleging that the grant of remission (described in the writ petition as grant of pardon) was illegal, relevant materials were not placed before the Governor, and without application of mind impugned order was passed. The recommendations made for grant of remission were based on irrelevant and extraneous materials.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: The factual scenario has not been placed before the Governor in the proper perspective. The sole basis on which respondent No.3 asked for pardon was alleged implication in false cases due to political rivalry. In view of this Court's judgment holding the respondent No.2 guilty, the said plea could not have been even considered as a basis for grant of pardon.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: Since the grant of pardon is based on consideration of irrelevant materials and non-consideration of relevant materials the same is liable to be set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: Learned counsel for the respondent-State and respondent Nos.2 and 3 has strenuously contended that the petition is the outcome of a political vendetta. All relevant materials have been taken into account by the Governor, a high constitutional authority who passed the order granting remission. It is submitted that the petitioner has confused between pardon and remission of sentence. It is a case where materials existed which warranted the grant of remission and this Court should not interfere in the matter. Considering the limited scope for judicial review the writ petition deserves to be dismissed.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: Considering the fact that in large number of cases challenge is made to the grant of pardon or remission, as the case may be, we had requested Mr. Soli J Sorabjee to act as Amicus Curiae. He has highlighted various aspects relating to the grant of pardon and remission, as the case may be, and the scope for judicial review in such matters. He has suggested that considering the frequency with which pardons and/or the remission are being granted, in the present political scenario of the country it would be appropriate for this Court to lay down guidelines so that there is no scope for making a grievance about the alleged misuse of power.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submitted that though in [?CITATION?] this Court had indicated certain recommendatory guidelines, the same did not find acceptance in [?CITATION?]. As a matter of fact in a later decision in [?CITATION?] the alleged apparent inconsistencies in the view was highlighted and a 3-Judge Bench held that laying down guidelines would be inappropriate.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: The relevant constitutional provisions regarding the grant of pardon, remissions, suspension of sentence, etc. by the President of India and the Governor of a State are as follows:\n",

Power of President to grant pardons, etc. and to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases \u0017 (1) The President shall have the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence \u0017 (a) in all cases where the punishment or sentence is by a Court Martial;\n",
      "Paragraph 13: (b) in all cases where the punishment or sentence is for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends;\n",

      "Paragraph 15: (2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the power conferred by law on any officer of the Armed Forces of the Union to suspend, remit or commute a sentence passed by a Court Martial.\n",

      "Paragraph 17: \"(1) Where any person has been sentenced to death in a Province, the Governor- General in his discretion shall have all such powers of suspension, remission or commutation of sentence as were vested in the Governor- General in Council immediately before the commencement of Part III of this Act, but save as aforesaid no authority in India outside a Province shall have any power to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted in the Province.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Provided that nothing in this sub-section affects any powers of any officer of His Majesty's forces to suspend, remit or commute a sentence passed by a Court- Martial.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: (2) Nothing in this Act shall derogate from the right of His Majesty, or of the Governor- General, if any such right is delegated to him by His Majesty, to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment.\" There was no provision in the Government Act corresponding to Article 161 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: The above constitutional provisions were debated in the Constituent Assembly on 29th December 1948 and 17th September 1949 [see Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol.7, pages 1118-1120 and Vol. 10, page 389]. The grounds and principles on which these powers should be exercised were neither discussed nor debated [See Framing of India's Constitution: A Study, 2\" Edition, Dr. Subhash C Kashyap, pages 367-371 , pages 397-399].\n",
      "Paragraph 21: In addition to the above constitutional provisions the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (in short 'Cr.P.C.') provides for power to suspend or remit sentences and the power to commute sentence in Section 432 and Section 433 respectively.\n",

      "Paragraph 27: \"432. Power to suspend or remit sentences.\u0017( I) When any person has been sentenced to punishment for an offence, the appropriate Government may, at any time, without conditions or upon any conditions which the person sentenced accepts, suspend the execution of his sentence or remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which he has been sentenced.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: (2) Whenever an application is made to the appropriate Government for the suspension or remission of a sentence, the appropriate Government may require the presiding Judge of the Court before or by which the conviction was had or confirmed, to state his opinion as to whether the application should be granted or refused, together with his reasons for such opinion and also to forward with the statement of such opinion a certified copy of the record of the trial or of such record thereof as exists.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: (3) If any condition on which a sentence has been suspended or remitted is, in the opinion of the appropriate Government, not fulfilled, the appropriate Government may cancel the suspension or remission, and thereupon the person in whose favour the sentence has been suspended or remitted may. if at large, be arrested by any police officer, without warrant and remanded to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: (4) The condition on which a sentence is suspended or remitted under this section may be one to be fulfilled by the person in whose favour the sentence is suspended or remitted, or one independent of his will.\n",

      "Paragraph 40: The philosophy underlying the pardon power is that \"every civilized country recognizes, and has therefore provided for, the pardoning power to be exercised as an act of grace and humanity in proper cases. Without such a power of clemency, to be exercised by some department or functionary of a government, a country would be most imperfect and deficient in its political morality, and in that attribute of Deity whose judgments are always tempered with mercy.\" [See 59 American Jurisprudence 2d, page 5].\n",
      "Paragraph 41: The rationale of the pardon power has been felicitously enunciated by the celebrated Justice Holmes of the United States Supreme Court in the case of [?CITATION?]:\n",
      "Paragraph 42: \"A pardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power. It is a part of the constitutional scheme. When granted, it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed.\" (emphasis added) \"Pardon and Parole\" as per Corpus Juris Secundum (Vol.67-A) reads as follows: (Pages 16 and 17) \"The pardoning power is founded on considerations of the public good, and is to be exercised on the ground that the public welfare, which is the legitimate object of all punishment, will be as well promoted by a suspension as by an execution of the sentence. It may also be used to the end that justice be done by correcting injustice, as where after-discovered facts convince the official or board invested with the power that there was no guilt or that other mistakes were made in the operation or enforcement of the criminal law. Executive clemency also exists to afford relief from undue harshness in the operation or enforcement of criminal law.\" Interests of society and convict (1) Acts of leniency by pardon are administered by the executive branch of the government in the interests of society and the discipline, education, and reformation of the person convicted. III- [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 43: (2) A pardon is granted on the theory that the convict has seen the error of his ways, that society will gain nothing by his further confinement and that he will conduct himself in the future as an upright, law-abiding citizen.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: Matter known to counsel The pardoning power is set up to prevent injustice to a person who has been convicted, especially when the facts of such injustice were not properly produced in the trial court, but such power is not a proper remedy on account of failure to use any matter which was known to defendant or his counsel and was available at time of new trial motion.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: Showing that convection was on perjured testimony \"Pardon and Parole\" as stated in AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE (Second Edition) (Volume 59) reads as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 46: I. INTRODUCTORY 1\\. History of pardoning power.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: Every civilized country recognizes, and has therefore provided for, the pardoning power to be exercised as an act of grace and humanity in proper cases. Without such a power of clemency, to be exercised by some department or functionary of a Government, a country would be most imperfect and deficient in its political morality, and in that attribute of Deity whose judgments are always tempered with mercy. In England, this power has been exercised from time immemorial, and has always been regarded as a necessary attribute of sovereignty. In the United States, this power is extended to the President by the United States Constitution, and in the various states and territories it is either conferred by constitutional provision or organic act, or provided for by statute, the power usually being conferred upon the governor or upon a board of which the governor is a member. In some instances, however, the governor's power is so limited as to render an arbitrary exercise impossible.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 2\\. Validity of contract to procure pardon;\n",
      "Paragraph 49: criminal liability. While the earlier cases uniformly held agreements to secure a pardon, parole, or commutation of sentence illegal irrespective of the services rendered or contemplated, the more recent decisions take the view that such contracts are valid or invalid according to the character of the services contemplated. Although there is some conflict of opinion, contracts entered into to obtain a pardon, parole, or commutation of sentence have generally been upheld where the services contemplated are not other than the proper presentation of the case before the pardoning power.\" Reprieve A reprieve, from the French word \"reprendre,\" to take back, is the withdrawing of a sentence for an interval of time, whereby the execution is suspended. It is merely the postponement of the execution of a sentence for a definite time, or to a day certain. It does not and cannot defeat the ultimate execution of the judgment of the court, but merely delays it temporarily. Reprieves at common law are of three kinds:\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 1\\. ex mandato regis, from the mere pleasure of the Crown;\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 2\\. ex arbitrio judicis, the power to grant which belongs of common right to every tribunal which is invested with authority to award execution; and\n",
      "Paragraph 52: 3\\. ex necessitate legis, required by law to be granted under certain circumstances, as when a woman convicted of a capital offence alleges pregnancy of a quick child in delay of execution, or when a prisoner has become insane between the time of sentence and the time fixed for execution.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: In Sir William Wades' Administrative Law (Ninth Edition) the position relating to pardon is stated as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 54: \"The royal prerogative The prerogative powers of the Crown have traditionally been said to confer discretion which no court can question; and there was long a dearth of authority to the contrary. But it may be that this was because the decided cases involved discretions which are, as has been laid down in the House of Lords, inherently unsuitable for judicial review, 'such as those relating to the making of treaties, the defence of the realm, the prerogative of mercy, the grant of honours, the dissolution of Parliament and the appointment of ministers as well as others'.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: But at the same time the House of Lords held that the court could review a ministers action (forbidding trade union membership by certain civil servants) under authority delegated to him by prerogative Order in Council, so that the principles of natural justice would apply. Administrative action was held to be reviewable in proceedings against the responsible minister without distinction as to the origin of the power, whether statute or common law. In later cases it was held that the dismissal of a civil servant involved 'a sufficient public law element' to be subject to Judicial review and that an unfair compensation award by the civil service appeal board should be quashed.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: So now it may be said that the royal prerogative does not per se confer unreviewable discretion, but that many of the powers contained in it will be of a kind with which the courts will not concern themselves.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: It may be the prerogative acts of the Crown itself, though taken on the advice of ministers are immune from review, whereas the action of ministers, though authorised by delegation of prerogative power, is reviewable.But this is an artificial distinction, and if the case were strong enough even an Order in Council might prove to be reviewable in a declaratory judgment.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: These propositions are founded on the wide definition of prerogative which has been criticized earlier. The making of treaties, for example, has no effect on the law of this country, so that there is no exercise of power which can concern the courts. It might be called prerogative without power, while the employment of civil servants might be called power without prerogative. A case where there may be neither prerogative nor power is the grant and refusal of passports, which has been claimed to be wholly within the prerogative and discretion of the Crown. A passport is merely an administrative device, the grant or cancellation of which probably involves no direct legal consequences, since there appears to be no justification for supposing that, in law as opposed to administrative practice, a Citizen's right to leave or enter the country is dependent upon the possession of a passport. The arbitrary power claimed by the Crown has now been made subject to judicial review along with various other non-legal powers discussed later. Other countries were ahead of Britain in protecting this necessary civil right.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: At least it is now judicially recognised that prerogative power is as capable of abuse as is any other power, and that the law can sometimes find means of controlling it. The prerogative has many times been restricted both by judicial decision and by statute. It is for the court to determine the legal limits of the prerogative, and they may include the same requirement of reasonable and proper exercise as applies to statutory powers\u0017 though with this difference, that it cannot be based upon the presumed intention of Parliament. In one unusual case, where a Parliamentary basis could be found because action taken by a minister under a treaty was held to be impliedly prohibited by a statute,\" Lord Denning MR discussed the nature of the prerogative and said:\n",
      "Paragraph 60: Seeing that the prerogative is a discretionary power to be exercised for the public good, it follows that its exercise can be examined by the courts just as any other discretionary power which is vested in the executive.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: Then after citing cases of abuse of statutory power he concluded:\n",
      "Paragraph 62: Likewise it seems to me that when discretionary powers are entrusted to the executive by the prerogative\u0017 in pursuance of the treaty-making power\u0017the courts can examine the exercise of them so as to see that they are not used improperly or mistakenly.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: Although this last remark was said in the House of Lords to be 'far too wide', in today's atmosphere it seems clear that the court would entertain a complaint that, for example, a royal pardon had been obtained by fraud or granted by mistake or for improper reasons. The High Court has gone so far as to review a decision of the Home Secretary not to recommend a posthumous free pardon for a youth hanged for murder forty years previously, on the ground that he considered only an unconditional pardon and failed to take account of other possibilities. Although the court made no order or declaration and merely invited the Home Secretary to look at the matter again, it clearly took a long step towards judicial review of the prerogative of mercy. For example it was clear that the Home Secretary had refused to pardon someone solely on the ground of their sex, race or religion, the courts would be expected to interfere and our judgment would be entitled to do so.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: In New Zealand the Court of Appeal has held that the prerogative power of pardon is not reviewable 'at any rate at present', but that the position might change justice so required; that the prerogative character of the power did not exempt it from review; but that the existing legal and administrative safeguards were adequate so that an extension of judicial review was unnecessary.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: A further question is whether the law should concern itself with the Crown's exercise of the ordinary powers and liberties which all persons possess, as in the making of contracts and the conveyance of land. It has hitherto been assumed that in this area the Crown has the same free discretion as has any other person. But where such powers are exercised for governmental purposes it is arguable that the courts should be prepared to intervene, as a matter of public ethics, as a safeguard against abuse. They do not allow local authorities to act arbitrarily or vindictively in evicting tenants, letting sports grounds or placing advertisements, for example. Those are technically statutory powers (since all local authorities are statutory), but they correspond to ordinary powers and liberties. If, as the House of Lords holds, the source of power is irrelevant, it would not seem impossible for judicial review to be extended to this 'third source' of public power which is neither statutory nor prerogative but is a remnant from the days of personal government. But the 'grotesquely undemocratic idea that public authorities have a private capacity is deeply embedded in our legal culture', and such judicial authority as there is, is not encouraging.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: We shall deal with the extent of power for judicial review as highlighted by learned counsel for the parties and learned Amicus Curie before we deal with the factual scenario.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: It is fairly well settled that the exercise or non-exercise of pardon power by the President or Governor, as the case may be, is not immune from judicial review. Limited judicial review is available in certain cases.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: In Maru Ram's case (supra) it was held that all public power, including constitutional power, shall never be exercisable arbitrarily or mala fide and, ordinarily, guidelines for fair and equal execution are guarantors of the valid play of power.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: It is noteworthy that in Kehar Singh's case (supra) the contention that the power of pardon can be exercised for political consideration was unequivocally rejected. In Maru Ram's case (supra) it was held that consideration of religion, caste, colour or political loyalty are totally irrelevant and fraught with discrimination.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: In Kehar Singh's case (supra) it was held that the order of the President cannot be subjected to judicial review on its merits except within the strict limitations delineated in Maru Ram's case (supra). The function of determining whether the act of a constitutional or statutory functionary falls within the constitutional or legislative conferment of power, or is vitiated by self- denial on an erroneous appreciation of the full amplitude of the power is a matter for the court.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: In Kehar Singh's case (supra), placing reliance on the doctrine of the division (separation) of powers it was pleaded, that it was not open to the judiciary to scrutinize the exercise of the \"mercy\" power. In dealing with this submission this Court held that the question as to the area of the President's power under Article 72 falls squarely within the judicial domain and can be examined by the court by way of judicial review.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: As regards the considerations to be applied to a petition for pardon/remission in Kehar Singh's case (supra) this Court observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 73: \"As regards the considerations to be applied by the President to the petition, we need say nothing more as the law in this behalf has already been laid down by this Court in Maru Ram.\" In the case of [?CITATION?] after referring to the judgments in the cases of Maru Ram's case (supra) and Kehar Singh's case (supra) this Court held as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 74: \"we cannot accept the rigid contention of the learned counsel for the third respondent that this court has no power to touch the order passed by the Governor under Article 161 of the Constitution. If such power was exercised arbitrarily, mala fide or in absolute disregard of the finer canons of the constitutionalism, the by-product order cannot get the approval of law and in such cases, the judicial hand must be stretched to it.\" The factual scenario in Swaran Singh's case (supra) needs to be noted. One Doodh Nath was found guilty of murdering one Joginder Singh and was convicted to imprisonment for life. His appeals to the High Court and Special Leave Petition to this Court were unsuccessful.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: However, within a period of less than 2 years the Governor of Uttar Pradesh granted remission of the remaining long period of his life sentence. This Court quashed the said order of the Governor on the ground that when the Governor was not posted with material facts, the Governor was apparently deprived of the opportunity to exercise the powers in a fair and just manner. Conversely, the impugned order, it was observed \"fringes on arbitrariness\".\n",
      "Paragraph 76: The Court held that if the pardon power \"was exercise arbitrarily, mala fide or in absolute disregard of the finer canons of the constitutionalism, the by- product order cannot get the approval of law and in such cases, the judicial hand must be stretched to it\". The Court further observed that when the order of the Governor impugned in these proceedings is subject to judicial review within the strict parameters laid down in Maru Ram's case (supra) and reiterated in Kehar Singh's case (supra): \"we feel that the Governor shall reconsider the petition of Doodh Nath in the light of those materials which he had no occasion to know earlier.\", and left it open to the Governor of Uttar Pradesh to pass a fresh order in the light of the observations made by this Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: In the case of [?CITATION?], this Court observed that the power of granting pardon under Article 161 is very wide and does not contain any limitation as to the time at which and the occasion on which and the circumstances in which the said powers could be exercised.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: Thereafter the Court held as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 79: \"the said power being a constitutional power conferred upon the Governor by the Constitution is amenable to judicial review on certain limited grounds. The Court, therefore, would be justified in interfering with an order passed by the Governor in exercise of power under Article 161 of the Constitution if the Governor is found to have exercised the power himself without being advised by the Government or if the Governor transgresses the jurisdiction in exercising the same or it is established that the Governor has passed the order without application of mind or the order in question is mala fide one or the Governor has passed the order on some extraneous consideration.\" The principles of judicial review on the pardon power have been re-stated in the case of [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 80: In [?CITATION?] it was inter-alia held as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 81: \"25. This principle was reiterated in [?CITATION?] in which it was, inter alia, laid down that the Court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely reviews the manner in which the decision was made particularly as the Court does not have the expertise to correct the administrative decision. If a review of the administrative decision is permitted, it will be substituting its own decision which itself may be fallible. The Court pointed out that the duty of the Court is to confine itself to the question of legality. Its concern should be:\n",
      "Paragraph 82: 1\\. Whether a decision-making authority exceeded its powers?;\n",
      "Paragraph 83: 2\\. committed an error of law;\n",
      "Paragraph 84: 3\\. committed a breach of the rules of natural justice;\n",
      "Paragraph 85: 4\\. reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal would have reached;\n",
      "Paragraph 86: or 5\\. abused its powers.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: 26\\. In this case, Lord Denning was quoted as saying: (SCC pp. 681-82, para 83) \"Parliament often entrusts the decision of a matter to a specified person or body, without providing for any appeal. It may be a judicial decision, or a quasi-judicial decision, or an administrative decision.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: Sometimes Parliament says its decision is to be final. At other times it says nothing about it. In all these cases the courts will not themselves take the place of the body to whom Parliament has entrusted the decision. The courts will not themselves embark on a rehearing of the matter. See [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 89: 27\\. Lord Denning further observed as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 90: (p. 682) \"If the decision-making body is influenced by considerations which ought not to influence it; or fails to take into account matters which it ought to take into account, the court will interfere. See [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 91: (emphasis supplied)\"\n",
      "Paragraph 92: 28\\. In [?CITATION?] it was pointed out that while exercising the power of judicial review, the Court is concerned primarily as to whether there has been any infirmity in the decision-making process? In this case, the following passage from Professor Wade's Administrative Law was relied upon: (SCC p. 457, para 17) \"The doctrine that powers must be exercised reasonably has to be reconciled with the no less important doctrine that the court must not usurp the discretion of the public authority which Parliament appointed to take the decision. Within the bounds of legal reasonableness is the area in which the deciding authority has genuinely free discretion. If it passes those bounds, it acts ultra vires. The court must therefore resist the temptation to draw the bounds too tightly, merely according to its own opinion. It must strive to apply an objective standard which leaves to the deciding authority the full range of choices which legislature is presumed to have intended.\" (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 93: 29\\. It may be pointed out that this principle was also applied by Professor Wade to quasi- judicial bodies and their decisions. Relying upon decision in [?CITATION?]. Professor Wade laid down the principle that where a public authority was given power to determine matter, mandamus would not lie to compel it to reach some particular decision.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: 30\\. A Division Bench of this Court comprising Kuldip Singh and B.P. Jeevan Reddy, JJ. in [?CITATION?] observed as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 95: (SCC pp. 306-07, para 11) \"11. The obligation to act fairly on the part of the administrative authorities was evolved to ensure the rule of law and to prevent failure of justice. This doctrine is complementary to the principles of natural justice which the quasi- judicial authorities are bound to observe. It is true that the distinction between a quasi- judicial and the administrative action has become thin, as pointed out by this Court as far back as 1970 in [?CITATION?] Even so the extent of judicial scrutiny/judicial review in the case of administrative action cannot be larger than in the case of quasi- judicial action. If the High Court cannot sit as an appellate authority over the decisions and orders of quasi-judicial authorities it follows equally that it cannot do so in the case of administrative authorities. In the matter of administrative action, it is well known, more than one choice is available to the administrative authorities; they have a certain amount of discretion available to them. They have 'a right to choose between more than one possible course of action upon which there is room for reasonable people to hold differing opinions as to which is to be preferred'. (Lord Diplock in [?CITATION?]) The Court cannot substitute its judgment for the judgment of administrative authorities in such cases. Only when the action of the administrative authority is so unfair or unreasonable that no reasonable person would have taken that action, can the Court intervene.\" (emphasis supplied) The position, therefore, is undeniable that judicial review of the order of the President or the Governor under Article 72 or Article 161, as the case may be, is available and their orders can be impugned on the following grounds:\n",
      "Paragraph 96: (a) that the order has been passed without application of mind;\n",
      "Paragraph 97: (b) that the order is mala fide;\n",
      "Paragraph 98: (c) that the order has been passed on extraneous or wholly irrelevant considerations;\n",
      "Paragraph 99: (d) that relevant materials have been kept out of consideration;\n",
      "Paragraph 100: (e) that the order suffers from arbitrariness Two important aspects were also highlighted by learned Amicus Curiae; one relating to the desirability of indicating reasons in the order granting pardon/remission while the other was an equally more important question relating to power to withdraw the order of granting pardon/remission, if subsequently, materials are placed to show that certain relevant materials were not considered or certain materials of extensive value were kept out of consideration. According to learned Amicus Curiae, reasons are to be indicated, in the absence of which the exercise of judicial review will be affected.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: So far as desirability to indicate guidelines is concerned in Ashok Kumar's case (supra) it was held as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 102: \"17- In Kehar Singh's case (supra) on the question of laying down guidelines for the exercise of power under Article 72 of the constitution this Court observed in paragraph 16 as under: (SCC pp. 217-18, para 16) \"It seems to us that there is sufficient indication in the terms of Article 72 and in the history of the power enshrined in that provision as well as existing case law, and specific guidelines need not be spelled out. Indeed, it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised guidelines, for we must remember that the power under Article 72 is of the widest amplitude, can contemplate a myriad kinds and categories of cases with facts and situations varying from case to case, in which the merits and reasons of State may be profoundly assist by prevailing occasion and passing time. And it is of great significance that the function itself enjoys high status in the constitutional scheme\".\n",
      "Paragraph 103: These observations do indicate that the Constitution Bench which decided Kehar Singh's case (supra) was of the view that the language of Article 72 itself provided sufficient guidelines for the exercise of power and having regard to its wide amplitude and the status of the function to be discharged thereunder, it was perhaps unnecessary to spell out specific guidelines since such guidelines may not be able to conceive of all myriads kinds and categories of cases which may come up for the exercise of such power.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: No doubt in Maru Ram's case (supra) the Constitution Bench did recommend the framing of guidelines for the exercise of power under Articles 72/161 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 105: But that was a mere recommendation and not ratio decidendi having a binding effect on the Constitution Bench which decided Kehar Singh's case (supra). Therefore, the observation made by the Constitution Bench in Kehar Singh's case (supra) does not upturn any ratio laid down in Maru Ram's case(supra). Nor has the Bench in Kehar Singh\"s case (supra) said any thing with regard to using the provisions of extant Remission Rules as guidelines for the exercise of the clemency powers.\" In Kehar Singh's case (supra) this Court held that:\n",
      "Paragraph 106: \"There is no question involved in the case of asking for reasons for the Presidents' Order\".\n",
      "Paragraph 107: The same obviously means that the affected party need not be given the reasons. The question whether reasons can or cannot be disclosed to the Court when the same is challenged was not the subject matter of consideration. In any event, the absence of any obligation to convey the reasons does not mean that there should not be legitimate or relevant reasons for passing the order.\n",
      "Paragraph 108: In [?CITATION?] in the context of exercise of power under Article 356 of the Constitution it was observed at page 109, para 87 as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 109: \"When the Proclamation is challenged by making out a prima facie case with regard to its invalidity, the burden would be on the Union Government to satisfy that there exists material which showed that the Government could not be carried on in accordance with the provision of the Constitution. Since such material would be exclusively within the knowledge of the Union Government, in view of the provision of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, the burden on proving the existence of such material would be on the Union Government.\" The position if the Government chooses not to disclose the reasons or the material for the impugned action was stated in the words of Lord Upjohn in the landmark decision in [?CITATION?]:\n",
      "Paragraph 110: \"if he does not give any reason for his decision it may be, if circumstances warrant it, that a court may be at liberty to come to the conclusion that he had no good reason for reaching that conclusion..\" The same approach was adopted by Justice Rustam S.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: Sidhwa of the Lahore High Court in [?CITATION?] the learned Judge observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 112: \"I have no doubt that both the Governments are not compelled to disclose all the reasons they may have when dissolving the Assemblies under Articles 58 (2)(b) and 112(2)(b). If they do not choose to disclose all the material, but only some, it is their pigeon, for the case will be decided on a judicial scrutiny of the limited material placed before the Court and if it happens to be totally irrelevant or extraneous, they must suffer.\" Justice Sidhwa's aforesaid observations have been referred to and approved in S.R. Bommai's case (supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 113: Since there is a power of judicial review, however, limited it may be, the same can be rendered to be an exercise in futility in the absence of reasons.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: The logic applied by this Court in Bommai's case (supra) in the context of Article 74(2) is also relevant. It was observed in paras 153 and 434 as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 115: \"153-Article 74(2) is not a bar against the scrutiny of the material on the basis of which the President had arrived at his satisfaction.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: 434- Article 74(2) merely bars an enquiry into the question whether any and if so, what advice was tendered by the Ministers to the President. It does not bar the court from calling upon the Union Council of Ministers (Union of India) to disclose to the court the material upon which the President had formed the requisite satisfaction. The material on the basis of which advice was tendered does not become part of the advice. Even if the material is looked into by or shown to the President, it does not partake the character of advice.\" So far as the second aspect relating to withdrawal is concerned, it is submitted that though there is no specific reference in this regard in either Article 72 or Article 161 of the Constitution yet by application of the provisions of the [General Clauses Act, 1897] (in short the '[General Clauses Act]') the same would be permissible. It is also highlighted that similar provisions are specifically provided in Sections 432 and 433 Cr.P.C. Merely because Article 72 and Article 161 of the Constitution have not been so provided specifically that would not mean that such power was not intended to be exercised.\n",
      "Paragraph 117: Sections 14 and 21 of the [General Clauses Act] deal with powers conferred to be exercisable from time to time and a power to issue, to include power to add to, amend, vary or rescind notifications, orders, rules or bye-laws. They read as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 118: \"14. Powers conferred to be exercisable from time to time- (1) Where, by any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, any power is conferred then unless a different intention appears that power may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires.\n",

      "Paragraph 121: \"11 - This provision is clearly a rule of interpretation which has been made applicable to the Constitution in the same manner as it applied to any Central Act or Regulation. On the face of it, the submission that Section 21 cannot be applied to the interpretation of the Constitution will lead to anomalies which can only be avoided by holding that the rule laid down in this section is fully applicable to all provisions of the Constitution.\" Section 432 (3) of Cr.P.C. reads as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 122: \"If any condition on which a sentence has been suspended or remitted is, in the opinion of the appropriate Government, not fulfilled, the appropriate Government may, cancel the suspension or remission, and thereupon the person in whose favour the sentence has been suspended or remitted may, if at large, be arrested by any police officer, without warrant and remanded to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence.\" The position in U.S.A. is summed up in Volume 67A Corpus Juris Secundum, p.21 para 16 as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 123: \"There is authority for the view that a pardon may be held void where it appears from the pardon that the pardoning power was misinformed; but there is also authority for the view that intentional falsehood or suppression of truth is necessary, and that misinformation given in good faith and in the belief in its truth is insufficient to avoid a pardon.A pardon procured by false and fraudulent representations or by intentional suppression of the truth is void, even though the person pardoned had no part in perpetrating the fraud.\" Inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that if it comes to the knowledge of the Government that the pardon has been obtained on the basis of manifest mistake or patent misrepresentation or fraud, the same can be rescinded or cancelled.\n",
      "Paragraph 124: In [?CITATION?] it was held:\n",
      "Paragraph 125: \"(1) The court had jurisdiction to review the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy by the Home Secretary in accord with accepted public law principles since the exercise of the prerogative was an important feature of the criminal justice system and a decision by the Home Secretary which was infected with legal errors ought not to be immune from legal challenge merely because it involved an element of policy or was made under the prerogative.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: (2) The Home Secretary's decision not to recommend a posthumous pardon for the applicant's brother was flawed because, in considering whether to grant a posthumous pardon, he had failed to recognise the fact that the prerogative of mercy was capable of being exercised in many different circumstances and over a wide range and had failed to consider the form of pardon which might be appropriate. Furthermore, there was no objection in principle to the grant of a posthumous conditional pardon where a death sentence had already been carried out, as the grant of such a pardon represented recognition by the state that a mistake had been made and that a reprieve should have been granted. Since the Home Secretary's failure to consider the grant of a posthumous conditional pardon when the previous Home Secretary's decision not to grant a reprieve had been clearly wrong amounted to an error of law, the court, while making no order on the application, would invite the Home Secretary to reconsider his decision.\n",
      "Paragraph 127: At page 452 of the Reports it was held as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 128: \"The Court of Appeal (Cooke P, Gauk and McKay JJ) dismissed the appeal but in doing so it said [?CITATION?]:\n",
      "Paragraph 129: 'The prerogative of mercy is a prerogative power in the strictest sense of that term, for it is peculiar to the Crown and its exercise directly affects the rights of persons. On the other hand it would be inconsistent with the contemporary approach to say that, merely because it is a pure and strict prerogative power, its exercise or non- exercise must be immune from curial challenge.\n",
      "Paragraph 130: There is nothing heterodox in asserting, as counsel for the appellant do, that the rule of law requires that challenge shall be permitted in so far as issues arise of a kind with which the Courts are competent to deal ... In the end the issue must turn on weighing the competing considerations, a number of which we have stated. Probably it cannot be said that any one answer is necessarily right; it is more a matter of a value or conceptual judgment as to the place in the law and the effectiveness or otherwise of the prerogative of mercy at the present day. In attempting such a judgment it must be right to exclude any lingering thought that the prerogative of mercy is no more than an arbitrary monarchial right of grace and favour.\n",
      "Paragraph 131: As developed it has become an integral element in the criminal justice system, a constitutional safeguard against mistakes.' xx xx xx xx \"Mr Pannick relies on this passage. He argues that the prerogative of mercy is exercised by the Home Secretary on behalf of us all. It is an important feature of our criminal justice system. It would be surprising and regrettable in our developed state of public law were the decision of the Home Secretary to be immune from legal challenge irrespective of the gravity of the legal errors which infected such a decision. Many types of decisions made by the Home Secretary do involve an element of policy (eg parole) but are subject to review.\n",
      "Paragraph 132: We accept these arguments, The CCSU case made it clear that the powers of the court cannot be ousted merely by invoking the word 'prerogative', The question is simply whether the nature and subject matter of the decision is amenable to the judicial process\".\n",
      "Paragraph 133: In \"JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION\"\n",
      "Paragraph 134: (Fifth Edition) by the Retired Hon'ble the Lord Woolf it has been noted as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 135: \"Other former prerogative powers should not any more, however, automatically be assumed to be non-justiciable. It is noticeable that one of the prerogative powers assumed by Lord Roskill in the GCHQ case to be non- justiciable, the prerogative of mercy, has since been judicially reviewed. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department. ex p Bentley, the applicant applied for review of the Home Secretary's decision not to pardon her brother who had been sentenced to death and hanged 39 years earlier. The applicant contended that the Home Secretary had erred in law in his approach to the issue in that he considered that the grant of free pardon required the finding that her brother was morally and technically innocent, where the right question to be asked was whether in all the circumstances the punishment imposed should have been suffered. It was held that the decision ought to be based upon accepted public law principles and not be immune from legal challenge, despite the element of policy in the decision. The Home Secretary's failure to consider the grant of a posthumous pardon when the previous Home Secretary's decision had been wrong was held to be a clear error of law. The court broke new ground in this case, guided only by a recent decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal\".\n",
      "Paragraph 136: In \"THE CONSTITUTION OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" (Analysis and Interpretation) \"Pardons and Reprieves\" have been stated as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 137: \"The Legal Nature of a Pardon In the first case to be decided concerning the pardoning power, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court, said: \"As this power had been exercised from time immemorial by the executive of that nation whose language is our language, and to whose judicial institution ours bear a close resemblance; we adopt their principles respecting the operation and effect of a pardon, and look into their books for the rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be used by the person who would avail himself of it. A pardon is an act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed, from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed. It is the private, though official act of the executive magistrate delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended, and not communicated officially to the Court.... A pardon is a deed, to the validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without acceptance.\n",
      "Paragraph 138: It may then be rejected by the person to whom it is tendered; and if it be rejected, we have discovered no power in a court to force it on him.\" Marshall continued to hold that to be noticed judicially this deed must be pleaded, like any private instrument.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: In the case of Burdick v. United States, Marshall's doctrine was put to a test that seems to have overtaxed it, perhaps fatally.\n",
      "Paragraph 140: Burdick, having declined to testify before a federal grand jury on the ground that his testimony would tend to incriminate him was proffered by President Wilson \"a full and unconditional pardon for all offenses against the United States,\" which he might have committed or participated in connection with the matter he had been questioned about.\n",
      "Paragraph 141: Burdick, nevertheless, refused to accept the pardon and persisted in his contumacy with the unanimous support of the Supreme Court. \"The grace of a pardon,\" remarked Justice McKenna sententiously, \"may be only a pretense ... involving consequences of even greater disgrace than those from which it purports to relieve. Circumstances may be made to bring innocence under the penalties of the law. If so brought, escape by confession of guilt implied in the acceptance of a pardon may be rejected.\" Nor did the Court give any attention to the fact that the President had accompanied his proffer to Burdick with a proclamation, although a similar procedure had been held to bring President Johnson's amnesties to the Court's notice. In 1927, however, in sustaining the right of the President to commute a sentence of death to one of life imprisonment, against the will of the prisoner, the Court abandoned this view.\n",
      "Paragraph 142: \"A pardon in our days,\" it said, \"is not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power. It is a part of the constitutional scheme. When granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed.\" Whether these words sound the death knell of the acceptance doctrine is perhaps doubtful.\n",
      "Paragraph 143: They seem clearly to indicate that by substituting a commutation order for a deed of pardon, a President can always have his way in such matters, provided that substituted penalty is authorised by law and does not in common understanding exceed the original penalty.\n",
      "Paragraph 144: Coming to the factual position it is noticed that the various materials were placed before the Governor when the request for grant of pardon/remission was processed at various levels. The views of the District level officials were obtained. Since they formed the basis of impugned order, it is relevant to take note of some interesting features. The three District level officials were Superintendent of Police, the District Collector, Kunoor and the District Probation Officer.\n",
      "Paragraph 145: Apart from that, the views of the Superintendent of jail, Central Prison, Cherlapally were obtained. The Collector's report refers to the report given by the Superintendent of Police and reproduces the same in the report contained in letter dated 9.12.2004. He also refers the letter dated 8.12.2004 of the Revenue Divisional Officer who according to him had indicated no objection to release of respondent No.2 on premature basis as his conduct and character was good and he lead ordinary life during the period of his escort parole from 19.5.2004 to 7.8.2004 and the free parole from 20.10.2004 to 6.11.2004. Only on that basis the District Collector recommended premature release.\n",
      "Paragraph 146: According to learned counsel for the State this was sufficient as the Collector had to act on some material and he acted on the reports of the Superintendent of Police and the Revenue Divisional officer. The plea is clearly unacceptable.\n",
      "Paragraph 147: The Collector does not appear to have made any independent enquiry on his own. The report of District Probation officer is very interesting. In his report he has stated that if he (Respondent No.2) is prematurely released his life would be safe because his wife is a sitting MLA and she is having a police security. Further he was having a strong hold in the village and there is no opposition in Bramhanakotkur village.\n",
      "Paragraph 148: Following portion of his report shows as to how extraneous materials which had no relevance formed the foundation of his report.\n",
      "Paragraph 149: \"The convict Gouru Venkata Reddy S/o Janardhan Reddy, Central Prison Cherlapalli belongs to Upper Caste Reddy's family of Brahmanakotkur (Village) Nandikotkur Mandal and Taluk. The father of the convict was Janardhan Reddy and mother was Gouru Lakshmi Devi and during enquiry it is revealed that both were dead. The grand mother of convict Smt. Ratnamma is old, aged and there is no male person in the house to look after her. She desires that the convict should come and provide medical treatment to her.\n",
      "Paragraph 150: In the past the convict contested in the elections and was defeated with small margin.\n",
      "Paragraph 151: During enquiry it is revealed that the convict is Congress Worker and due to political conspiracy he was defeated. In the elections conducted later on the wife of convict Smt.\n",
      "Paragraph 152: Saritha Reddy contested and was elected.\n",
      "Paragraph 153: During enquiry it is revealed that the matters mentioned in the application of the wife of the convict are true. The convict has two sisters.\n",
      "Paragraph 154: The deceased K. Rama Subbaiah and Ambi Reddy belong to Nandikotkur village. In this murder case the convict is not involved but due to political reasons his name was implicated in the case by producing false witnesses and sent to the Jail. But later they realized their mistake and the family members of the deceased are maintaining cordial relations. During enquiry it is revealed that there is no danger to the life of the convict from the villagers and also there is no danger to the villagers from the convict if the convict is released as stated by the President of the village Shri Shaik Ziauddin, Village Secretary Sri Sanjanna, village elders Shri Nagaswamy Reddy, Sri K. Venkata Rami Reddy, Shri Khajamoinuddin and Sri Pathan Moutali etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 155: As seen from the past history of the convict he is not a naxalite, dacoit, and habitual offender. He was peacefully carrying out agricultural activities and a good Congress Worker. He used to provide employment to a number of persons through agriculture. It is also revealed that the villagers are having good opinion on the convict. \" (underlined for emphasis) Apart from apparently wrong statement made that respondent No.2 was maintaining cordial relationship with the family members of the deceased, he has highlighted that he was a \"good Congress Worker\". Further there is an inference that he was not involved in the murder was falsely implicated and false witnesses were produced. This inference on the fact of this Court's judgment is utterly fallacious. The question of his being a \"good Congress Worker\" has no relevance the objects sought to be achieved i.e. consideration of the question whether pardon/remission was to be granted. Equally surprising is the statement to the effect that during enquiry it was revealed that the convict is Congress worker and by political conspiracy he was defeated in the elections conducted earlier.\n",
      "Paragraph 156: The report of the Superintendent of Police is equally interesting. He has stated that there will be no reaction in Brahmana Kotkur village and Nandikotkur town if the prisoner releases on prematurely. The report is dated 6.12.2004. Before the elections, the same officer had reported that on account of respondent No.2's release on parole, there was likelihood of breach of peace and law and order if he visits Nandikotkur Assembly Constituency. The only reason why a pariah becomes a messiah appears to be the change in the ruling pattern. With such pliable bureaucracy, there is need for deeper scrutiny when power of pardon/remission is exercised.\n",
      "Paragraph 157: It appears that in the petition filed by respondent No.3 there is no mention about pendency of a Criminal case No.\n",
      "Paragraph 158: 411 of 2000. Learned counsel for the respondent No.1-State submitted that though this fact was not mentioned by the respondent No.3 in the petition yet the State Government considered the effect of the pendency of that petition. This certainly is a serious matter because a person who seeks exercise of highly discretionary power of a high constitutional authority, has to show bona fides and must place materials with clean hands.\n",
      "Paragraph 159: When the principles of law as noted above are considered in the factual background it is clear that the irrelevant and extraneous materials entered into the decision making process, thereby vitiating it.\n",
      "Paragraph 160: The order granting remission which is impugned in the petition is clearly unsustainable and is set aside. However, it is open to the respondent No.1 to treat the petition as a pending one for the purpose of re-consideration. It shall be open to the Governor to take note of materials placed before him by the functionaries of the State, and also to make such enquiries as considered necessary and relevant for the purpose of ascertaining the relevant factors otherwise. The writ petitions are allowed to the extent indicated above. No costs.\n",

      "Paragraph 2: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.5856 of 2005 M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Ltd. .. Appellant(s) -versus- Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises Ltd. & Anr. . .. Respondent(s) WITH   SLP ) No.1398 of 2006 Civil Appeal No.5857 of 2005 Civil Appeal No.5858 of 2005\n",
      "Paragraph 3: SLP ) No.1398 of 2006\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 1\\. As prayed by learned counsel Mr. Parijat Sinha this petition is dismissed as withdrawn.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 2 Civil Appeal No.5856 of 2005\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 2\\. These petitions have been filed against the judgment and order dated 1.2.2006 in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.31199 of 2005 of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 3\\. By that decision the High Court has quashed the Press Note Number 12 dated 31.8.1998 and Notification SO 808(E) dated 11.9.1998, issued by the Central Government, by which the Sugar Industry was de-licensed under Section 29B of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act'.)\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 4\\. As a consequence, the High Court has debarred the respondent number 6 from establishing a sugar industry without obtaining a licence under Section 11 of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 5\\. The High Court has also cancelled the permission, if any, granted to the respondent number 5 to 6 for purchasing and/or 3 acquiring land for the purposed of establishing new sugar industries without licence.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 6\\. It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the effect of the impugned judgment and order quashing of the Notification dated 11.9.1998 and the Press Note dated 31.8.1998 is that the sugar industry in India has virtually been thrown back into the era of `License Raj', nullifying the efforts of the Government of India to open up the economy to prospective investors. Also, all the sugar industries established throughout India after 11.9.1998 (as per the available data they are 100 in number) have become illegal. Industrial development, particularly in the sugar producing States, may well come to a grinding halt. An investment of about Rs.4000 crores in the sugar industry in U.P. alone has been jeopardized. The petitioner herein alone has invested about Rs.600 crores in the sugar industry in the State of U.P. after the said Notification and Press note were issued. Further, the petitioner has committed an investment of an amount of Rs.700 crores in the 4 sugar industry in U.P. It is submitted that lacs of farmers throughout India and particularly in the State of U.P. will suffer as they would be forced to sell their cane at lesser price to the existing sugar mills and those who are not even able to crush their assigned quantity of sugarcane and make timely payment of cane to the farmers, besides rendering thousands of workers directly employed in sugar factories jobless. Also, lacs of families indirectly attached with industries ancillary to the sugar industry will be severely affected as a result.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 7\\. The petitioner acting bonafide and after complying with all the requirements stipulated in the Press Note/Notification, is setting up seven Sugar Factories at various places in U.P. with an aggregate investment of nearly Rs.1300 crores with a capacity of 7000 tonnes crushed per day (TCD) each. The petitioner has already completed and commenced production in one factory at Kinouni, Meerut, which the petitioner had set up in a record seven months period on 5.11.2004 and further three factories are already 5 completed and ready to commence production in September, 2005 including the one which is under challenge in the writ petition in which the impugned judgment has been passed. Further, the petitioner is expecting to complete the commissioning of production in another three factories as fast as possible. The three factories are ready to operate before the on set of the forthcoming crushing season in September, 2005 to enable the farmers to take full economic advantage thereof. The remaining three factories shall commence production in 2006. The petitioner has already spent about Rs.600 crores on the purchase of land, plant and machinery and other miscellaneous expenditure. Further, the construction of buildings of the other three sugar factories and integrated distillery for production of Ethanol etc. is in full swing on which a further sum of Rs.700 crores is committed to be invested for which the petitioner had also made GDR issue of US$ 110 million and committed in the international market. It is submitted that all the projects of the petitioner would be affected by the impugned judgment.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 6\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 8\\. It is submitted that in the State of U.P., the sugar industry is one of the most important industries, with sugarcane being the chief cash crop. Thousands of people have been provided employment in this industry alone. Nearly half of India's sugarcane area is situated in U.P. alone, which constitutes roughly 42% of the total sugarcane production in the country. However, despite adequate availability of sugarcane area, U.P. still lags behind Maharashtra in the production of sugar. Even though the demand of sugar in the country has increased manifold but the sugar industry in U.P. has remained stagnant over a long period of time due to various reasons including sickness of uneconomic and unviable units mainly in the Government and the cooperative sector. Due to low sugarcane crushing capacity, the farmers were forced to sell their cane to less remunerative uses. The petitioner's sugar projects have brought a new hope to the farmers at large.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 9\\. Sugar, is item number 25 of the first Schedule of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. Hence, no 7 one could set up a sugar industry without a licence as per Section 11 of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: 10\\. The Industries (Development and Regulation) Act was passed in 1951. The statements of objects and reasons of the Act states as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 16: \"The object of this Bill is to provide the Central Government with the means of implementing their industrial policy which was announced in their Resolution No.1(3)-44(13) 48, dated 6th April, 1948 and approved by the Central Legislature. The Bill brings under Central control the development and regulation of a number of important industries, the activities of which affect the country as a whole and the development of which must be governed by economic factors of all-India import. The planning of future development on sound and balanced lines is sought to be secured by the licensing of all new undertakings by the Central Government. The Bill confers on Government power to make rules for the registration of existing undertakings, for regulating the production and development of the industries in the Schedule and for consultation with Provincial Governments on these matters.\".............\n",
      "Paragraph 17: 11\\. Section 2 of the Act states as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 18: \"2\\. Declaration as to expediency of control by the Union - It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the industries specified in the First Schedule.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 19: 8 12\\. Section 3(i) of the Act states as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 20: \"(i) \"scheduled industry\" means any of the industries specified in the First Schedule.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 13\\. Sugar is mentioned in item no.25 of the First Schedule to the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 14\\. The historical background is that up to about 1930 there were practically no sugar industries in India and we had to import all our sugar from foreign countries like West Indies, Jawa, etc. Hence around 1930 the British Government invited some businessmen and requested them to set up sugar industries in India so that we can produce our own sugar. These businessmen told the British Government that they were willing to set up such industries provided they were assured of regular supply of sugarcane.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: It may be mentioned that sugarcane is the main raw material for manufacture of sugar. If an adequate supply of sugarcane was not available to the sugar mills the mills would have to close down entailing heavy losses to the proprietors. The Government accepted this request and framed laws for ensuring a regular supply of sugarcane to any sugar mill established in India and made various regulations for the sugar industry.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 9\n",
      "Paragraph 25: 15\\. The 1951 Act placed the sugar industry in the First Schedule to the Act, which meant that no sugar industry could be set up without a licence from the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 16\\. Since independence the situation has totally changed in India. Now India has a heavy industrial base and also has several sugar mills. Hence the earlier regulatory laws relating to the sugar industry, including the requirement of a licence, have evidently served their purpose and are no longer required and may in fact be obstructing the growth of industry in our country now. Hence the policy of liberalization began in the early 1990s and it appears that it was in pursuance of the liberalization policy that the impugned Press Note and Notification were issued.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 17\\. A perusal of the background in which de-licensing of sugar industry was done shows that it was a well considered step which was done having regard to the stage of development of the industry. This background is:\n",
      "Paragraph 28: a) On 24th July 1991, the Government of India announced its liberalized \"Industrial Policy 1991\".\n",
      "Paragraph 29: b) On 25th July, 1991, the first notification i.e. Notification No.477(E) came to be issued by virtue of which 20 out of the 38 10 Scheduled industries were taken out of the purview of Section 10, 11, 11A & 13 of the Act. The structure of this notification was that it appended three negative lists (Schedule I, II and III) and the scheduled industries not specified in these three lists were obviously within the scope of the exemption.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: These lists were changed from time to time during the period 1991-2010 and as things stand at present only a handful of industries now remain in these negative lists.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: c) As far as the sugar industry is concerned, a Parliamentary Committee was appointed which recommended de-licensing of the sugar industry as early as in 1996. Later, pursuant to certain directions of the Allahabad High Court yet another Committee was appointed (the Mahajan Committee), which also supported reform of the licensing system. In August 1998, considering the recommendations of these two reports the Government of India issued Press Note 12 dated 31.8.1998 de-licensing the sugar industry, subject to the condition that there would be a minimum of 15 km distance between two sugar mills.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: The Press Note was then followed by the formal notification on 11.9.1998, issued under Section 29B(1) of the Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 11\n",
      "Paragraph 34: 18\\. The Press Note and Notification read as follows :- \"PRESS NOTE Subject : De-licensing of Sugar industry.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 1\\. The Government has further viewed the list of industries under compulsory licensing and has decided to delete sugar industry from the list of industries requiring compulsory licensing under provisions of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. However, in order to avoid unhealthy competition among sugar factories to procure sugarcane, a minimum of 15 KM would continue to be observed between an existing sugar mill and a new mill by exercise of power under Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 2\\. The entrepreneurs who wish to avail themselves of the de-licensing of sugar industry would be required to file an Industrial Entrepreneurs Memoranda (IEM) with the Secretariat of Industrial Assistance in the Ministry of Industry as laid down for all de-licensing Industries in terms of the Press Note dated 2nd August, 1991, as amended from time to time.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: 3\\. Entrepreneurs who have been issued letter(s) of intent (LOI) for manufacture of sugar need not file an initial IEM. In such cases, the LOI holder shall only file part B of the LOI at the time of commencement of commercial production against the LOI issued by them. It is, however, open to entrepreneurs to file an initial IEM (in lieu of the LOI/Industrial Licence held by them) if they so desire, whenever any variation from the conditions and parameters stipulated in the LOI/Industrial Licence is contemplated.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 12 \"NOTIFICATION (266) Ministry of Industry (Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion) Notification No.S.O.808(E) dated September 11, 1998 published in the Gazette of India, Extra, Part II, Section 3 (ii) dated 14th September, 1998 p.2, no.599 (F.No.10(13)/96 I.P.).\n",
      "Paragraph 39: In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) as Section 29-B of the Industries (Development and Regulations) Act, 1951 (65 of 1951), the Central Government hereby makes the following further amendment in the notification of the Government of India in the Ministry of Industry (Department of Industrial Development Number S.O.477(E) dated the 25th July, 1991, namely :- In Schedule II to the said notification, item 4, relating to Sugar and the entries thereunder shall be omitted.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 19\\. Section 29B(1) of the Act states :\n",
      "Paragraph 41: \"29-B. Power to exempt in special cases :\n",
      "Paragraph 42: (1) If the Central Government is of opinion, having regard to the smallness of the number of workers employed or to the amount invested in any industrial undertaking or to the desirability of encouraging small undertakings generally or to the stage of development of any scheduled industry, that it would not be in public interest to apply all or any of the provisions of this Act thereto, it may by notification in the Official Gazette, exempt, subject to such conditions as it may think fit to impose, any Industrial undertaking or class of industrial undertakings or any scheduled industry or class of scheduled industries as it may specify in the notification from the operation of all or any of the provisions of this Act or any rule or order made thereunder,\"\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 13\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 20\\. It may be mentioned that after the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 1.2.2006, several developments have taken place relating to the sugar industry which have a substantial effect on the issues involved in these appeals. These are as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 45: (i) The High Court of Delhi in a case reported as [?CITATION?] upheld the validity of the Press Note dated 31.08.98 being a policy of the Government of India under Article 73 of the COI. Therefore Delhi High court upheld the validity of the Press Note dated 31.08.98 which was quashed by the Allahabad HC on 24.08.05.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: (ii) Thereafter the Government of India in exercise of its power under Section 3 of the [Essential Commodities Act, 1955] amended the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 by inserting Clauses 6A to 6E vide the Sugarcane (Control) Amendment Order, 2006, inter alia, laying down the \"effective steps\" which the applicant is required to take such as purchase of required land in the name of the mill, payment of advance and opening of LOC with suppliers, commencement certificate of civil work and construction of building, sanction of requisite term loans from the banks or financial institutions and any other steps prescribed by the Central Government in this regard.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: (iii) This Court by its judgment dated 02.04.07 in [?CITATION?] considered the Press Note dated 31.08.98, the amendment of Sugarcane Control Order, 2006 and the liberalization policy of the Government of India in sugar industry.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: This Court after analyzing the provisions of the Press Notes in respect of prescribing minimum distance between two sugar mills, and the new Sugarcane Control Order, 2006 held that the defect pointed out by the Delhi High Court in paragraph 63 of its judgment has been removed by the Government of India by bringing in the amendment in 2006. This Court held that this amendment is clarificatory in nature and retrospective in operation and shall apply to all cases pending in various courts.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: 21\\. In view of the judgment of this Court in Ojas Industries (supra) upholding the validity of the Press Note prescribing distance norms and subsequent amendments in 2006 in Sugarcane Control Order 1966 and making it retrospective, the issues involved in the present case have been substantially decided. The challenge of the writ petitioner in the High Court was based on the setting up of a sugar mill in its vicinity (though beyond 15 kms away) because of the policy of de-licensing prescribed under Notification dated 11.09.98 issued in exercise of powers under Section 29(B) (1) of the IDR Act, 1951. This Court has upheld the distance norms i.e. a minimum distance of 15 kms between two mills retrospectively. The 15 main thrust of the petitioner's challenge to the de-licensing policy thus disappears.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 22\\. It is settled law that in the areas of economics and commerce, there is far greater latitude available to the executive than in other matters. The Court cannot sit in judgment over the wisdom of the policy of the legislature or the executive.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 23\\. Thus in [?CITATION?] it was observed (vide paragraph 92 and 93) :\n",
      "Paragraph 52: \"92\\. In a democracy, it is the prerogative of each elected Government to follow its own policy. Often a change in Government may result in the shift in focus or change in economic policies. Any such change may result in adversely affecting some vested interests. Unless any illegality is committed in the execution of the policy or the same is contrary to law or mala fide, a decision bringing about change cannot per se be interfered with by the court.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 93\\. Wisdom and advisability of economic policies are ordinarily not amenable to judicial review unless it can be demonstrated that the policy is contrary to any statutory provision or the Constitution. In other words, it is not for the courts to consider relative merits of different economic policies and consider whether a wiser or better one can be evolved.\"................\n",
      "Paragraph 54: 16 24\\. In the same decision in paragraph 39 it was observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 55: \"39\\. In [?CITATION?] while considering the Court's powers in interfering with the policy decision, it was observed at page 715 as under: (SCC para 54) \"54\\. It is not the domain of the Court to embark upon the unchartered ocean of public policy in an exercise to consider as to whether a particular public policy is wise or a better public policy can be evolved. Such exercise must be left to the discretion of the executive and legislative authorities as the case may be.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 25\\. In paragraph 42 of the aforesaid decision this Court quoted from its earlier decision in [?CITATION?] as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 57: \"........................The executive authority of the State must be held to be within its competence to frame a policy for the administration of the State. Unless the policy framed is absolutely capricious and, not being informed by any reason whatsoever, can be clearly held to be arbitrary and founded on mere ipse dixit of the executive functionaries thereby offending Article 14 of the Constitution or such policy offends other constitutional provisions or comes into conflict with any statutory provision, the Court cannot and should not outstep its limit and tinker with the policy decision of the executive function of the State. This Court, in no uncertain terms, has sounded a note of caution by indicating that policy decision is in the domain of the executive authority of the State and the Court should not embark on the unchartered ocean of public policy and should not question the efficacy or otherwise of such policy so long the same does not offend any provision of the statute or the Constitution of India. The supremacy of each of the three organs of the State i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary in their respective fields of 17 operation needs to be emphasized. The power of judicial review of the executive and legislative action must be kept within the bounds of constitutional scheme so that there may not be any occasion to entertain misgivings about the role of the judiciary in outstepping its limit by unwarranted judicial activism being very often talked of in these days. The democratic set-up to which the polity is so deeply committed cannot function properly unless each of the three organs appreciate the need for mutual respect and supremacy in their respective fields.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 58: (emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 26\\. The same view has been taken by this court in [?CITATION?] (vide para 18), [?CITATION?] (vide para 23 and 24), [?CITATION?] (vide para 20), etc..\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 27\\. In[?CITATION?] (vide para 3 and 5) this Court held that the power to frame a policy by executive or legislative decision included the power to withdraw the same.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 28\\. In the present case the de-licensing has been done under Section 29B of the Act and we see no illegality in the same.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: 18\n",
      "Paragraph 63: 29\\. In our opinion the High Court has placed an erroneous interpretation on the language of Section 29B. Section 29B provides that having regard to any of the four specified factors, if the Central Government is of the opinion that it would not be in public interest to apply \"all or any\" of the provisions of this Act to a scheduled industry, it may by notification in the official gazette exempt (conditionally or otherwise) any industrial undertaking or any class of industrial undertakings, or any scheduled industry or class of scheduled industries. The four specified factors on the basis of which the power may be exercised are as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 64: a) the smallness of the number of workers employed or b) the amount invested in any industrial undertaking or c) the desirability of encouraging small undertakings generally or d) the stage of development of any scheduled industry.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 30\\. A plain reading of Section 29B shows that having regard to the stage of development of any schedule industry if the Central Government is of the opinion that there should be an exemption from some or all of the provisions of the Act, it can issue an appropriate notification for this purpose. Sub- section 2 of the Section 29B also confers upon the Central Government an express power of cancellation of such exemption. In our opinion sufficient 19 guidelines have been provided by the legislature for the Government in this connection. The power conferred under Section 29B is in our opinion not tainted by the vice of excessive delegation because the essential legislative policy is specified in the preamble to the IDR Act and is writ large throughout the provisions of the Act. The grounds on which exemption from licensing can be granted - one of them being the stage of development of the industry - are also specified in Section 29B. The legislative policy having been clearly stated, in our opinion there is no excessive delegation.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: See in this connection [?CITATION?] pages 179-180, [?CITATION?](vide para 5 and 7), [?CITATION?](vide para 13), [?CITATION?] (vide para 14, 19, 20 and 21), [?CITATION?](vide para 5-18, 41 reviews case law on delegated legislation right from F. N. Balsara) and [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 31\\. The legislative history of Section 29B clearly establishes the legislative intention to confer a wide power of exemption upon the Central Government.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: a) Section 28, as was originally enacted, conferred upon the Central Government, in general terms, the power to exempt any scheduled industry or any industrial undertaking from the operation of all or any provisions of this Act. There was no further provision of any parliamentary control (by way of placing the exemption notifications before parliament for its approval or otherwise) contemplated in the said original Section.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: b) Amendments were made to the IDR in 1953 when Section 29B was inserted in substitution of Section 28. The amended provision contemplated the grant of exemption on the four factors indicated hereinbefore. However, no power of reservation for the Small Scale Sector was contemplated in these provisions. In 1956 further amendments were made by way of insertion of Sub-section 2, which confers the power of cancellation of exemptions.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: c) The Central Government sought to make reservation of certain industries for the Small Scale Sector. The Bombay High Court in 21 Shree Vindhya Paper Mills Case AIR (1983) Bom 270 held that Section 29B confers power to exempt, but not to reserve. Hence it was held that such reservation was ultra-vires Section 29B. To overcome the effect of this judgment Section 29B was amended again in 1984 by inserting the provisions of Sub-section 2(A) to 2(H) including a validating provision for validating all reservations made on or from 19th February, 1970. In the amended provision, Section 2(H) contemplated laying before each House of Parliament, the notified orders made under Sub-section 2(A). It is significant that no similar requirement was contemplated even then, in relation to notified orders issued under Sub-Section (1) granting exemption.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 32\\. The High Court has in the impugned judgment held that the de- licensing could only be done by the legislature and not by the executive. We do not agree. It is well settled that the executive power of Union of India is co- extensive with the legislative power vide Article 73(1) of the Constitution. Hence in our opinion it was not necessary to amend the Act to de-license the sugar industry. The notification under Section 29B was sufficient for this purpose.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: 22 33\\. In the impugned judgment the High Court has observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 73: \"Licensing is a part of regulation of the scheduled industry. Therefore licensing policy of the Government cannot be said not to be in the public interest. De- licensing policy largely affects the interest of the people.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: Somebody may say for socialism or somebody may say for globalization, but the thought of majority people has to be reflected in the House by the majority vote. Then and then alone the policy can be accepted as a law by its amendment. Therefore, without ascertaining the pros and cons on that line mere issuance of notification by the pen of the executive is an action without jurisdiction and as such illegal.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 34\\. With respect we cannot agree with this observation. There is nothing in the 1951 Act which required a notification under Section 29B(1) to be approved by Parliament. Also, whether it is in the public interest to issue such a notification is ordinarily for the Government to decide, and the Court should exercise judicial restraint in this connection. Whether there should be licensing of an industry or not is for the executive authorities to decide.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 35\\. The High Court has further observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 77: \"The necessity of de-licensing came in the mind of the Government by the passage of time since when the waves of liberalization started coming. The Government was considering the same and possibly for this reason reports from the Advisory Committees were sought for.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: But after placement before the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha what prompted them not to place before the Parliament, but issue a Press Note and Notification 23 directly omitting the sugar industry from the list of compulsorily licensable industry is fishy state of affairs.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: Therefore, the elements of illegality, unfair play, adopting back door process, arbitrariness, malafides, and abuse of power cannot be ruled out.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 36\\. With respect to the above observation we may say that the High Court has probably overlooked that the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha together constitute Parliament in India. Also, as already stated above, the 1951 Act does not require a notification under Section 29B(1) to be approved by Parliament. Hence there was nothing fishy about the impugned notification.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: To say that elements of illegality, unfair play etc. cannot be ruled out is really acting on conjectures and surmises, not on evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: 37\\. The High Court has held that exemption from licensing can be granted under Section 29B to small industries but not to large industries. With respect we cannot agree. A perusal of Section 29B(1), which has been quoted above, shows that a notification under the said provision can be issued in respect to four categories. Smallness of the industry, is only one of such categories. The fourth category viz. `the stage of development of any scheduled industry' is very wide, and thus gives wide power to the Central Government to de-license even large industries.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: 24\n",
      "Paragraph 84: 38\\. In his dissenting judgment in [?CITATION?] Mr. Justice Brandeis, the celebrated Judge of the U.S.\n",
      "Paragraph 85: Supreme Court, observed that the Government must be left free to engage in social experiments. Progress in the social sciences, even as in the physical sciences, depends on \"a process of trial and error\" and Courts must not interfere with necessary experiments. In the same decision Justice Brandeis also observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 86: \"To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to the Nation.\" (See also `The Legacy of Holmes and Brandeis' by Samuel Konefsky).\n",
      "Paragraph 87: 39\\. In the Constitution bench decision of the Supreme Court in [?CITATION?] it was observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 88: \"What is best for the sugar industry and in what manner the policy should be formulated and implemented, bearing in mind the fundamental object of the statute viz.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: supply and equitable distribution of essential commodity at fair prices in the best interest of the general public is a matter for decision exclusively within the province of the Central Government. Such matters do not ordinarily attract the power of judicial review.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 90: 25 40\\. It was held in the above decision as well as in [?CITATION?] that even if some persons are at a disadvantage and suffered losses on account of formulation and implementation of the Government policy that is not by itself sufficient ground for interference by the Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: 41\\. In [?CITATION?], Mr. Justice Frankfurter of the U.S. Supreme Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 92: \"Congress was confronted with the formulation of policy peculiarly within its wide swath of discretion. It would be a singular intrusion of the judiciary into the legislative process to extrapolate, restrictions upon the formulation of such an economic policy from those deeply rooted notions of justice which the Due Process Clause expresses.............\"\n",
      "Paragraph 93: 42\\. We should not be understood to have meant that the judiciary should never interfere with administrative decisions. However, such interference should be only within narrow limits e.g. when there is clear violation of the statute or a constitutional provision, or there is arbitrariness in the Wednesbury sense. It is the administrators and legislators who are entitled to frame policies and take such administrative decisions as they think 26 necessary in the public interest. The Court should not ordinarily interfere with policy decisions, unless clearly illegal.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: 43\\. Economic and fiscal regulatory measures are a field where Judges should encroach upon very warily as Judges are not experts in these matters.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: The impugned policy parameters were fixed by experts in the Central Government, and it is not ordinarily open to this Court to sit in appeal over the decisions of these experts. We have not been shown any violation of law in the impugned notification or Press Note.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: 44\\. The power to lay policy by executive decisions or by legislation includes power to withdraw the same unless it is by mala fide exercise of power, or the decision or action taken is in abuse of power. The doctrine of legitimate expectation plays no role when the appropriate authority is empowered to take a decision by an executive policy or under law. The court leaves the authority to decide its full range of choice within the executive or legislative power. In matters of economic policy, it is settled law that the court gives a large leeway to the executive and the legislature.\n",
      "Paragraph 97: Granting licences for import or export is an executive or legislative policy.\n",
      "Paragraph 98: The Government would take diverse factors for formulating the policy in the overall larger interest of the economy of the country. When the Government 27 is satisfied that change in the policy was necessary in the public interest it would be entitled to revise the policy and lay down a new policy.\n",
      "Paragraph 99: 45\\. In [?CITATION?] the Supreme Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 100: \"We do not think that it is the function of the Court to sit in judgment over such matters of economic policy as must necessarily be left to the government of the day to decide. Many of them are matters of prediction of ultimate results on which even experts can seriously err and doubtlessly differ. Courts can certainly not be expected to decide them without even the aid of experts.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 101: 46\\. In [?CITATION?] the Supreme Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 102: \"Judicial review is not concerned with matters of economic policy. The Court does not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature or its agents as to matters within the province of either. The Court does not supplant the view of experts by its own views.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 103: It must be remembered that certain matters are by their nature such as best be left to experts in the field. This Court does not have the technical and administrative expertise in this respect.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: 47\\. In the words of Chief Justice Neely :\n",
      "Paragraph 105: \"I have very few illusions about my own limitations as a Judge. I am not an accountant, electrical engineer, financer, banker, stockbroker or system 28 management analyst. It is the height of folly to expect Judges intelligently to review 5000 page record addressing the intricacies of a public utility operation. It is not the function of a Judge to act as a super board, or with the zeal of a pedantic school master substituting its judgment for that of the administrator.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 106: 48\\. In our opinion there should be judicial restraint in fiscal and economic regulatory measures. The State should not be hampered by the Court in such measures unless they are clearly illegal or unconstitutional. All administrative decisions in the economic and social spheres are essentially ad hoc and experimental. Since economic matters are extremely complicated this inevitably entails special treatment for distinct social phenomena. The State must therefore be left with wide latitude in devising ways and means of imposing fiscal regulatory measures, and the Court should not, unless compelled by the statute or by the Constitution, encroach into this field.\n",
      "Paragraph 107: 49\\. In our opinion, it will make no difference whether the policy has been framed by the legislature or the executive and in either case there should be judicial restraint. The Court can invalidate an executive policy only when it is clearly violative of some provisions of the Statute or Constitution or is shockingly arbitrary but not otherwise.\n",
      "Paragraph 108: 29 50\\. As held by this Court in [?CITATION?], the Court must maintain judicial restraint and not ordinarily encroach in the domain of executive or legislature.\n",
      "Paragraph 109: 51\\. In our opinion the impugned Press Note and Notification were validly issued under Section 29B of the Act. Hence the impugned judgment cannot be sustained and it is hereby set aside.\n",
