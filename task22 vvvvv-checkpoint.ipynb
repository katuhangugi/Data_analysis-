      "Paragraph 2: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2226 OF 2010 [Arising out of Special Leave to Appeal (C) No.26684 of 2008] State of Haryana & Ors. ... Appellants Versus Manoj Kumar ... Respondent\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Dalveer Bhandari, J.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 1\\. Leave granted.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 2\\. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 4.2.2008 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in a Civil Writ Petition No.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 12094 of 2007.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 3\\. The appellants are aggrieved by the impugned judgment of the High Court by which the High Court has set aside the 2 concurrent findings of courts below while exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 4\\. Brief facts which are necessary to dispose of this appeal are as under:-\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 5\\. On 10.11.1999, an agreement to sell a commercial plot measuring 788 sq.yards located on Delhi-Mathura Mewla Maharajpur, Faridabad was executed by Smt. Manjula Gulati in favour of respondent, Manoj Kumar. The entire sale consideration was paid and the actual possession was also given, but the sale deed was not executed till 9.2.2001.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 6\\. According to the appellants, in order to evade substantial stamp duty, the respondent filed a suit, without impleading the appellants as parties to the suit, for specific performance of agreement to sell dated 10.11.1999 executed by Smt. Gulati for the sale of property measuring 788 sq.yards for a total consideration of Rs.1,95,000/-. The suit was promptly decreed in favour of the respondent by the Civil Judge (Junior Division), Faridabad. The suit as a matter of fact was filed on 3 14.9.2000 and decreed on 9.2.2001 and no further appeal was filed which clearly indicated that the suit was filed between the parties only with the purpose to evade the substantial stamp duty. The court directed its Reader to execute the decree and get the sale deed registered in favour of the respondent. The Reader of the court at the court's direction appeared before the Sub Registrar on 9.2.2001 and got the sale deed registered in favour of the respondent for the property for a sale consideration of Rs.2,00,000/-. According to the appellants, the court decree was obtained by concealing the material facts in order to evade the actual payable stamp duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 7\\. According to the appellants, the Joint Sub Registrar, Faridabad made a report that the sale deed executed on 9.2.2001 by respondent Manoj Kumar and the owner Manjula Gulati was under-valued. According to him, no sale deed can be registered for an amount which is less than the amount fixed by the collector or the circle rate (Rs.4,200/- per Sq.Yard).\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 8\\. The total value of the land at the rate of Rs.4,200/- per Sq.Yard works out to be Rs.33,09,600/-. On that amount, 4 the stamp duty registration charges of the sale deed payable would be Rs.5,13,050/-. In the instant case, the respondent has only paid Rs.31,000/- towards the stamp duty which was obviously under-valued.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 9\\. The District Collector, Faridabad in his order directed the respondent to make payment of difference of the amount of stamp duty amounting to Rs.4,82,050/-.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 10\\. The interpretation of amended section 47(A) of the Haryana Act has to be in consonance with the notified circle rates and any value fixed below that would be in direct conflict with the prevalent law of the land and, therefore, liable to be struck down by the authorities.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: 11\\. Section 47-A of the Haryana Amendment to Stamp Act, as applicable to the parties, reads as under:- S.47-A. - Instruments under-valued, how to be dealt with. - (1) If the Registering Officer appointed under the [Registration Act, 1908] , while registering any instrument transferring any property, has reason to believe that the value of the property or the consideration, as the case may be, has not been truly set forth in the instrument, he may, after registering such instrument, refer the same to the Collector for determination of the value or consideration, as the case may be, and the proper duty payable thereon.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 5 (2) On receipt of reference under sub-section (1), the Collector shall, after giving the parties a reasonable opportunity of being heard and after holding an enquiry in such manner as may be prescribed by rules made under this Act, determine the value or consideration and the duty as aforesaid and the deficient amount of duty, if any, shall be payable by the person liable to pay the duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: (3) The Collector may suo motu, or on receipt of reference from the Inspector- General of Registration or the Registrar of a district, in whose jurisdiction the property or any portion thereof, which is the subject- matter of the instrument is situate, appointed under the [Registration Act, 1908] ; and the deficient amount of duty, if any, shall be payable by the person liable to pay the duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: 12\\. According to the District Collector, Faridabad the respondent did not truly set-forth the true value in the instrument, therefore, order under section 47-A was passed against him.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: 13\\. The respondent aggrieved by the said order of the District Collector filed an appeal before the Commissioner, Gurgaon 6 Division, Gurgaon (Haryana) challenging the order dated 6.12.2005. The Commissioner by order dated 8.6.2007 dismissed the appeal by holding that the Collector rate or circle rate prescribed for sale of land in village Mewla Maharajpur of commercial nature was Rs.4,200/- per sq.yard and the respondent was directed to pay the balance amount of stamp duty.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: 14\\. The respondent aggrieved by the said order of the Commissioner preferred a Civil Writ Petition No.12094 of 2007 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 15\\. The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution has set aside the concurrent findings of facts of the courts below and observed that \"where the specific performance of contract in respect of immovable property has been granted, the ostensible sale price given in the transfer deed is to be accepted by the Registering Authority.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 16\\. According to the High Court, this was done primarily on the two grounds, firstly, \"because the court has accepted that price and has decreed the suit for specific performance\";\n",
      "Paragraph 23: 7 secondly, \"there cannot be any opportunity with the vendee to fabricate an agreement of sale for showing the incorrect sale price because litigating parties would not ordinarily reach such an agreement and sign the fabricated document.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 17\\. The High Court further observed that \"the authenticity of the decree passed by the court cannot be questioned.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: Therefore, the genuineness of the sale price has to be presumed.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 18\\. The appellants were not parties in the first place in the said suit and, therefore, either in law or on facts could not be bound by such a decree hence, such observation and finding on the fact of it is illegal and liable to set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 19\\. The High Court in the impugned judgment has set aside the concurrent findings of fact of the courts below. The appellants aggrieved by the impugned judgment of the High Court have preferred this appeal. The appellants are particularly aggrieved by the observations of the High Court that \"the authenticity of the decree passed by the court cannot be questioned. Therefore, the genuineness of the sale price has to be presumed.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 28: 8\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 20\\. According to the appellants, the High Court failed to appreciate that the respondent had intentionally evaded payment of the true stamp duty. The circle rate or the collector rate for the sale of commercial plot of 788 sq.yards was Rs.5,13,050 whereas the respondent paid only Rs.31,000/-. Hence the respondent was under the bounden obligation to pay the balance amount of Rs.4,82,050/-.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: 21\\. The appellants also urged that when the respondent had paid the full amount of sale consideration on 10.11.1999, then why was the sale deed executed only on 9.2.2001? The respondent has given no explanation for non- registration of sale deed for such a long time.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: 22\\. The appellants urged that the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 is very limited and the High Court, while exercising the jurisdiction under Article 227, has to ensure that the courts below work within the bounds of their authority.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 23\\. More than half a century ago, the Constitution Bench of this court in [?CITATION?] settled that power under Article 227 is limited to seeing that the courts below function within the limit of its authority or jurisdiction.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 24\\. This court placed reliance on Nagendra Nath's case in a subsequent judgment in [?CITATION?] The court observed that jurisdiction conferred under Article 227 is not by any means appellate in its nature for correcting errors in the decisions of subordinate courts or tribunals but is merely a power of superintendence to be used to keep them within the bounds of their authority.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: 25\\. This court had an occasion to examine this aspect of the matter in the case of [?CITATION?] . The court observed as under:- \"The supervisory jurisdiction conferred on the High Courts under Article 227 of the Constitution is limited \"to seeing that an inferior Court or Tribunal functions within the limits of its authority,\" and not to correct an error apparent on the face of the record, much less an error of law. for this case there was, in our opinion, no error of law much less an error apparent on the face of the record. There was no failure on the part of the learned Subordinate Judge to exercise jurisdiction nor did he act in 10 disregard of principles of natural justice. Nor was the procedure adopted by him not in consonance with the procedure established by law. In exercising the supervisory power under Article 227, the High Court does not act as an Appellate Court or Tribunal. It will not review or reweigh the evidence upon which the determination of the inferior court or tribunal purports to be based or to correct errors of law in the decision.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 26\\. This court again clearly reiterated the legal position in [?CITATION?] The court again cautioned that the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution cannot assume unlimited prerogative to correct all species of hardship or wrong decisions. It must be restricted to cases of grave dereliction of duty and flagrant abuse of fundamental principles of law or justice, where grave injustice would be done unless the High Court interferes.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 27\\. A three-Judge Bench of this court in [?CITATION?] again abundantly made it clear that the High Court cannot interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the subordinate court or the tribunal while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: Its function is limited to seeing that the subordinate court or 11 the tribunal functions within the limits of its authority. It cannot correct mere errors of fact by examining the evidence and re-appreciating it.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 28\\. In [?CITATION?] this court held that the limited power under Article 227 cannot be invoked except for ensuring that the subordinate courts function within its limits.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 29\\. This court over 50 years has been consistently observing that limited jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 cannot be exercised by interfering with the findings of fact and set aside the judgments of the courts below on merit.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 30\\. According to the appellants, the High Court was not justified in interfering with the findings of fact of the courts below. Consequently, the impugned judgment of the High Court is totally unsustainable.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 31\\. Mr. Manoj Swarup, Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent supported the impugned judgment. According to him, the enquiry under section 47-A is confined to whether value has not been truly set forth in the instrument.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 12 According to him, the Legislature has expressed its intention clearly by emphasizing the detail i.e. that value as set forth in the instrument. Or else, the Legislature would have used the terminology `market value' or `circle rates'.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 32\\. Mr. Swarup placed reliance on [?CITATION?] This Court in this case held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 44: \"5\\. It will be only on objective satisfaction that the Authority has to reach a reasonable belief that the instrument relating to the transfer or property has not been truly set forth or valued or consideration mentioned when it is presented for registration......\n",
      "Paragraph 45: ........\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 6\\. It would thus be seen that the aforesaid guidelines would inhibit the Registering Authority to exercise his quasi-judicial satisfaction of the true value of the property or consideration reflected in the instrument presented before him for registration. The statutory language clearly indicates that as and when such an instrument is presented for registration, the sub-Registrar is required to satisfy himself, before registering the document, whether true price is reflected in the instrument as it prevails in the locality...........\"\n",
      "Paragraph 47: 33\\. Mr. Swarup further submitted \"that circle rates have been held to constitute only one of the factors to be taken into consideration. Circle rates cannot be regarded as the last 13 word on the subject. This Court in the case of [?CITATION?] held that:- \"22.....The authorities cannot regard the guideline valuation as the last word on the subject of market value.....\"\n",
      "Paragraph 48: \"24....It is clear, therefore, that guideline value is not sacrosanct as urged on behalf of the appellants, but only a factor to be taken note of if at all available in respect of an area in which the property transferred lies.........\"\n",
      "Paragraph 49: 34\\. In the light of the above it is submitted that circle rates could have been taken as one of the factors and not the last word on the subject. The other factors being:- i) the price agreed upon between the vendor and the vendee ii) whether it was a distress sale iii) whether the price in the local area had gone down/escalated - at the time of the sale iv) Other relevant factors\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 35\\. It is submitted that these other factors have not been considered, not even noticed by the Authority under the Act.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 36\\. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. We are clearly of the opinion that the High Court, in the impugned judgment, has erred in interfering with the 14 concurrent findings of fact of the courts below under its limited jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution. The High Court erroneously observed that the \"the authenticity of the decree passed by the court cannot be questioned.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: Therefore, the genuineness of the sale price has to be presumed.\" This finding of the High Court cannot be sustained. It would have far reaching ramifications and consequences. If the genuineness of the sale price entered into by the buyer and the seller cannot be questioned, then in majority of the cases it is unlikely that the State would ever receive the stamp duty according to the circle rate or the collector rate. The approach of the High Court is totally unrealistic.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 37\\. The High Court in the impugned judgment has also erroneously observed that \"there cannot be any opportunity with the vendee to fabricate an agreement of sale for showing the incorrect sale price because the litigating parties would not ordinarily reach such an agreement and sign the fabricated document.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 54: 15\n",
      "Paragraph 55: 38\\. The High Court gravely erred in not properly comprehending the facts of this case in proper perspective and which has led to grave miscarriage of justice.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 39\\. It is not disputed that the commercial plot of 788 sq.yards located at Delhi-Mathura Mewla Maharajpur, Faridabad was valued by the Circle rate at Rs.4,200 per sq.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: yard fixed by the Collector of Faridabad meaning thereby that after the notification, no sale deed can be registered for an amount lesser than Rs.4,200/- per sq.yard. It may be pertinent to mention that, in order to ensure that there is no evasion of stamp duty, circle rates are fixed from time to time and the notification is issued to that effect. The issuance of said notification has become imperative to arrest the tendency of evading the payment of actual stamp duty. It is a matter of common knowledge that usually the circle rate or the collector rate is lower than the prevalent actual market rate but to ensure registration of sale deeds at least at the circle rates or the collector rates such notifications are issued from time to time by the appellants.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: 16\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 40\\. In the impugned judgment, the High Court has not properly construed the observations of the District Collector, Faridabad in which he has clearly stated as under :- \"It appears that the suit has been filed in the Civil Court and decree passed with the intention to avoid tax and stamp duty to be paid to the Government, because when respondent had paid entire sale consideration to the vendor, then he should have got the sale deed also executed at that time, whereas the same has not been done. Therefore, keeping into consideration the above facts, I come to this conclusion that sale deed No.11200 dated 9.2.2001 has been executed in respect of land measuring 788 sq.yard situated in village Mewla Maharajpur, which abuts Delhi Mathur Road. This plot is commercial and this fact has been concealed by the respondent. The sale deed had been registered for less value. The market value of the land in dispute as per Collector rate is Rs.33,09,600/- on which a total stamp duty of Rs.5,13,050/- was payable whereas the respondent has affixed stamp duty of Rs.31,000/-. In this manner on the above deed, the stamp duty of Rs.4,82,050/- is payable, which is ordered to be recovered from the respondent in accordance with law.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 41\\. This order was upheld by the Commissioner. The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227 has 17 set aside the orders passed by the District Collector, Faridabad and upheld by the Commissioner, Gurgaon without any basis or rationale. Apart from the jurisdiction, even what is factually stated in the order of the District Collector, Faridabad as upheld by the Commissioner, Gurgaon is unexceptionable and any interference was totally unwarranted.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 42\\. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained and is accordingly set aside and the order passed by the District Collector, Faridabad which was upheld by the Commissioner, Gurgaon is restored. The respondent is directed to pay the balance stamp duty within four weeks from the date of this judgment, otherwise the appellants would be at liberty to take appropriate steps in accordance with law.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: 43\\. The appeal is allowed and disposed of. The parties are directed to bear their respective costs.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: The petitioners in all these petitions, served as Medical, Dental and Veterinary officers in the Army Medical Corps (AMC), Army Dental Corps (ADC) and Veterinary Corps ('RVC') controlled by the Ministry of Defence (for short, 'Ministry'). All of them retired prior to 1.1.1996. These petitions involve a common question relating to calculation of their pension.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: 2\\. Defence Ministry Circular dated 31.12.1965 barred private practice (which was a traditionally enjoyed privilege) by AMC officers with effect from 1.1.1966 and conveyed the sanction of the President to the grant of a Non- Practising Allowance ('NPA' for short) to all AMC officers irrespective of the rank, with a stipulation that such NPA shall be treated as Pay for all purposes. Ministry circular dated 2.11.1987 clarified that NPA will be treated as 'pay' for all service matters, and will be taken into account for computing Dearness Allowance and other allowances as well as for calculation of retirement benefits. It also prescribed the rate of NPA for AMC and ADC Officers as Rs. 600/- for basic pay below Rs. 3000/-, Rs.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 800/- for basic pay between Rs. 3000/- and Rs. 3700/- and Rs. 900/- for basic pay of Rs. 3700/- and above. The NPA was revised as 25% of basic pay and Rank pay, with effect from 1.1.1996 (subject to the condition that pay plus NPA does not exceed Rs. 29,500/-). G.O. No. 2/S/98, issued by the Ministry, which implemented the Fifth Central Pay Commission recommendations in regard to revision of pay scales, gave the benefit of the revised NPA to all AMC, ADC and RVC officers who were receiving NPA.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 3\\. The recommendations of Fourth Central Pay Commission in regard to pensionary benefits for Armed Force Officers retiring on or after 1.1.1986 were implemented by Ministry Circular dated 30.10.1987. The said Circular provided that retiring pension of all commissioned officers of the three services, shall be calculated at 50 per cent of the reckonable emoluments, for a qualifying service of 33 years (to be reduced proportionately for lesser qualifying service). It defined 'reckonable emoluments' for purposes of retiring/service pension as average of pay, NPA and rank pay, if any, drawn by the officer during the last 10 months of his service. It defined the term 'pay' as basic pay in the revised pay scales.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 4\\. The recommendations of the Fifth Central Pay Commission were accepted and accorded sanction by the President on 24.11.1997.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: Consequently, the Ministry issued various circulars implementing the recommendations in regard to pensioners.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: Re : Pre 1996 Pensioners The Ministry issued a Circular dated 27.5.1998 (read with earlier circular dated 24.11.1997) rationalizing the pension of pre 1996 pensioners of the Armed Forces, by providing that the consolidated pension of existing pre 1996 pensioners will be calculated with effect from 1.1.1996, by aggregating the following : i) the existing pension; ii) dearness relief up to CPI 1510 (i.e. @148%, 111% and 96% as the case may be, of basic pension as admissible on 1.1.1996 vide DP & PWs OM dated 20.3.19996); iii) Interim relief I; iv) Interim relief II; and v) Fitment weightage @ 40 per cent of the existing pension.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: Re : Pensioners retiring on and after 1.1.1996 The Ministry issued a circular dated 3.2.1998, providing that the retiring pension of Armed Force Officer retiring on or after 1.1.1996 shall be calculated at 50% of average of reckonable emoluments during the last 10 months of service, (reckonable emoluments being basic pay including rank pay, stagnation increment and NPA) for a qualifying service of 33 years, to be reduced proportionately for lesser period of qualifying service.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 5\\. The Ministry by Circular dated 7.6.1999, conveyed the decision of the President that 'with effect from 1.1.1996, pension of all Armed Forces pensioners irrespective of their date of retirement shall not be less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996 of the rank, held by the pensioner.' The circular provided that the revision of pension should be undertaken as follows in case of commissioned officers (both post and pre 1.1.1996 retirees) :\n",
      "Paragraph 10: i) \"Pension shall continue to be calculated at 50% of the average emoluments in all cases and shall be subject to a minimum of Rs.1275/- p.m. and a maximum of upto 50% of the highest pay applicable to Armed Forces personnel but the full pension in no case shall be less than 50% of the minimum of the revised scale of pay introduced w.e.f. 1.1.96 for the rank last held by the Commissioned Officer at the time of his/her retirement. However, such pension shall be reduced pro rata, where the pensioner has less than the maximum required service for full pension. [vide clause 2.1 (a)]  ii) Where the revised and consolidated pension of pre-1.1.96 pensioners are not beneficial to him/her under these orders and is either equal to or less than existing consolidated pension under this Ministry's letters dated 24.11.97, 27.5.98 and 14.7.98, as the case may be, his/her pension will not be revised to the disadvantage of the pensioner [vide clause 4]\".\n",
      "Paragraph 11: The pension of the petitioners were stepped up, re-fixed and paid accordingly.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 6\\. The implementing departments had some doubts in regard to interpretation of the circular dated 7.6.1999. They therefore, sought clarifications from the Ministry on the following two issues  (i) whether NPA admissible as on 1.1.1986 is to be taken into consideration after refixation of pay on notional basis as on 1.1.1986; and (ii) whether NPA is to be added to the minimum of the revised scale while considering stepping up the consolidated pension on 1.1.1996. The Ministry issued the following clarification, vide Circular dated 11.9.2001, in regard to the Circular dated 7.6.1999 :\n",
      "Paragraph 13: \"The undersigned is directed to refer to Ministry of Defence letter No.1(1)/99/D(Pension/Services) dated 7th June, 1999, wherein decision of the government that pension of all pensioners irrespective of their date of retirement shall not be less than 50% of the minimum of the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.96 of the post last held by the pensioner was communicated.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: NPA granted to medical officers does not form part of the scales of pay. It is a separate element, although it is taken into account for the purpose of computation of pension.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: This has been examined in consultation with the Deptt. of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare and the Department of Expenditure and it is clarified that NPA is not to be taken into consideration after re-fixation of pay on notional basis on 1.1.1986. It is also not to be added to the minimum of the revised scale of pay as on 1.1.1996 in cases where consolidated pension is to be stepped up to 50%, in terms of Ministry of Defence Letter No.1(1)/99/D (Pension/Services) dated 7th June, 1999.\" [Emphasis supplied] The Circular also directed the Controller General of Defence Accounts to recalculate the pension by excluding NPA from Basic Pay and await further instructions regarding recovery of excess payments made with effect from 1.1.1996. In view of it, the pension of the petitioners have been revised by excluding the NPA element, by issuing corrigenda to their PPOs.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 7\\. The writ petitioners are aggrieved by the said clarification contained in the Circular dated 11.9.2001 and the consequential corrigenda to their PPOs reducing their pension. The petitioners therefore filed writ petitions, in different High Courts for the following reliefs :- i) For quashing the circular dated 11.9.2001 and/or for a direction to respondents not to give effect to the said circular.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: ii) For quashing the consequential corrigenda PPOs, issued to the petitioners by the Controller of Defence Accounts.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: iii) For a direction to the respondents, to take into account, NPA at the rate of 25% of the basic pay, including Rank Pay as was being done till the issue of circular dated 11.9.2001, while calculating their pension.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: [Note : The actual prayers in each case vary slightly in form. What is given above is the general purport of the prayers in these petitions].\n",
      "Paragraph 20: The said writ petitions have been transferred to this Court, in pursuance of applications for transfer filed by the Union of India.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 8\\. To understand the grievance of the petitioners, it is necessary to give an illustration :\n",

      "Paragraph 25: CONTENTIONS OF PENSIONERS :\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 9\\. The petitioners have urged the following contentions :- 9.1) The Defence Service Medical Officers were earlier entitled to private practice. The permission to private practice was withdrawn with effect from 1.1.1966 and in lieu of it, the President sanctioned a non-practising allowance (NPA) with the stipulation that such NPA will be treated as 'Pay' for all purposes. As a consequence, in respect of Medical Officers, NPA was always treated as part of 'pay' for purposes of pension. By Circular dated 7.6.1999, the benefit of stepping up was extended to all armed forces pensioners, including medical officers, with effect from 1.1.1996. The benefit extended was that irrespective of their date of retirement, their pension shall not be less than the 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996 of the rank held by the respective pensioner. The words \"minimum pay\" should be interpreted as minimum pay in the revised pay-scale plus NPA, in so far as Medical Officers entitled to NPA, as in their cases, the term 'Pay' wherever it occurs, means and includes basic pay plus NPA.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 9.2) The Ministry had correctly understood the term \"50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay,\" used in the circular dated 7.6.1999 as \"50% of the minimum in the revised pay-scale plus NPA\", and on that basis issued modified PPOs., revising the pension. For example, in the case of Lt.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: Generals, where the applicable revised pay scale was Rs.22,400-525-24,500, the Ministry took the minimum in the revised scale of pay (Rs.22,400/-) and added 25% thereof (Rs.5,600/-) as NPA and arrived at the pension as Rs.14,000/- being 50% of the aggregate sum of Rs. 28,000/-. The Circular dated 11.9.2001, under the guise of a clarification, directed that NPA be omitted while calculating the 50% of the minimum pay in the revised pay scales, for purposes of stepping up. This amounted to unauthorized modification of the President's decision contained in the Ministry's Circular dated 7.6.1999. It is also opposed to the rule that in the case of Medical Officers, 'Pay' includes NPA, for all purposes. The Ministry had no authority to modify or dilute the President's Policy decision which is given effect by Circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 9.3) In the case of Medical Officers who retired on or after 1.1.1996, even after the clarificatory circular dated 11.9.2001, NPA is added to the basic pay in the revised pay-scale and 50% of the aggregate is being paid as 'retiring pension'. Adding NPA to the basic pay for arriving at the pension in the case of those who retired on or after 1.1.1996 and omitting to add NPA in the case of pre 1996 retirees amounts to hostile discrimination of pre 1996 retirees, violating Article 14 and the principles relating to pension laid down by this Court in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 30: 9.4) The Delhi High Court had struck down a similar clarificatory Circular dated 19.10.1999 relating to Civilian Medical Officers (corresponding to Defence Ministry Circular dated 11.9.2001 under challenge in these petitions) by judgment dated 18.5.2002. That decision has attained finality and the Union of India has implemented it by reverting back to addition to NPA to minimum pay, for purposes of stepping up the pension in regard to pre 1996 civilian Medical Officers. Union of India has to extend to similar treatment, even in the case of Defence Service Medical Officers, by ignoring the clarification dated 11.9.2001.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: 9.5) At all events, irrespective of the validity of the clarification dated 11.9.2001, even if any amount has been wrongly paid to petitioners, the Respondents cannot recover such excess amount paid in pursuance of the Circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",

      "Paragraph 34: (i) Whether the Circular dated 11.9.2001, is only a clarification, or an amendment, to the Circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: (ii) Whether the Circular dated 7.6.1999 as clarified by Circular dated 11.9.2001, leads to unequal treatment of those who retired prior to 1.1.1996 and those who retired after 1.1.1996 solely with reference to date of retirement.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: (iii) Whether the respondents having accepted and implemented the decision of the Delhi High Court (in Dr. K.C. Garg vs. Union of India  C.M.P. No. 7322/2001 and connected cases decided on 18.5.2002) on a similar issue, are required to extend a similar treatment to Defence Service Medical Officers also, by cancelling the Circular dated 11.9.2001.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: (iv) Even if the Circular dated 11.9.2001 is found to be valid, whether Respondents are not entitled to recover the excess payments made.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Re : Question No. (i) :\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 11\\. We may first refer to the intent and purport of the Circular dated 7.6.1999. The Circular dated 7.6.1999 neither prescribes the requirements/qualifications for entitlement to pension nor the method of determination of pension. It only effectuates the President's decision that the pension (Which has already been determined in accordance with the applicable rules/orders) irrespective of the date of retirement, shall not be less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scales of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996. Pension is determined as per relevant rules/orders, by calculating the average of reckonable emoluments (basic pay, Rank Pay and NPA) drawn during the last 10 months of service and then taking 50% thereof as the retiring pension applicable to retirees with 33 years of qualifying service, with proportionate reduction for retirees with lesser period of qualifying service. The basis for calculating the pension in respect of those who retired prior to 1.1.1996, and those retired on or after 1.1.1996 happens to be the same. The retiring pension is 50% of the average reckonable emoluments for retirees with 33 years of qualifying service, with proportionate reduction for those with lesser years of qualifying service.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: The President's decision given effect by Circular dated 7.6.1999 only extends to all pre 1996 retirees, who did not have the benefit of fixation of pension with reference to the revised pay scales which came into effect on 1.1.1996, the benefit of the said revised pay scales, albeit in a limited manner. In so doing, it also puts those who retired on or after 1.1.1986 and pre 1986 retirees on par and on a common platform, removing the disparity, if any, in their pensions.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 12\\. When the Fifth Central Pay Commission recommendations were implemented, the pension of those who retired prior to 1.1.1996, was rationalized by directing that their pension shall be the aggregate of (a) existing pension; (b) dearness relief; (c) interim relief I; (d) interim relief II, and (e) fitment weightage of 40% of the existing pension. The 'existing pension' referred to therein was the pension which had been arrived at by calculating 50% of the average pay, NPA and Rank Pay during the last 10 months of service. The Circular dated 7.6.1999 made it clear that pension of retirees shall continue to be calculated at 50% of average of reckonable emoluments for the last 10 months before retirement, but only stipulated that the 'full' pension (that is pension for 33 years service) shall not be less than the 50% of the minimum pay in the revised pay scale introduced with effect from 1.1.1996. The Circular dated 7.6.1999 also made it clear that if the minimum prescribed therein was not beneficial to the pensioner, that is, where it was either equal to or less than the existing consolidated pension, his pension will not be reduced to his disadvantage. In short, the Circular dated 7.6.1999, merely stepped up the pension (for a qualifying service of 33 years) to 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996 of the rank held by such pensioner, where his pension was less. We may here note that whenever the reference is to stepping up pension to 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay, it applies to those with 33 years of qualifying service and gets proportionately reduced for lesser period of qualifying service.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 13\\. The emoluments of those who retired on or after 1.1.1996, calculated with reference to the basic pay in the revised scale of pay plus NPA will certainly be more than the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay and therefore, in their cases, the question of stepping up will not arise. On the other hand, as the pension of pre-1996 retirees was based on the basic pay under the old pay scale plus NPA, and as the old pay scale was much less than the 1996 revised pay scale, their pension required to be stepped up. The extent to which the existing pension should be stepped up is clearly specified in the Circular as \"minimum pay in the revised scale of pay\". The words used do not give room for any confusion or doubt. A 'pay scale' has basically three elements. The first is the minimum pay or initial pay in the pay scale. The second is the periodical increment. The third is the maximum pay in the pay scale. An employee starts with the initial pay in the pay scale and gets periodical increases (increments) and reaches the maximum or ceiling in the pay scale. Each stage in the pay scale starting from the initial pay and ending with the ceiling in the pay scale, when applied to an employee is referred to as 'basic pay' of the employee. Whenever the government revises the pay scales, a fitment exercise takes place as per the principle of fitment (formula) provided in the rules governing the revision of pay so that the 'basic pay' in the old scale is converted into a 'basic pay' in the revised pay scale. When the circular dated 7.6.1999 used the words '50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay', it referred to 50% of the initial pay in the revised scale of pay. If the old scale of pay was Rs.7300- 100-7600 and if the revised scale of pay was Rs.22400-525-24500, the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay would be Rs.22400 and 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay would be Rs. 11200/-.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 14\\. It is no doubt true that the term 'pay', with reference to medical officers, includes the basic pay and NPA. But the term 'basic pay' does not include NPA. In the absence of any special definition, the term 'basic pay of a government servant' refers to the applicable stage of pay in the pay scale to which he is entitled, and does not include NPA even in the case of Medical Officers. What the circular dated 7.6.1999 intended to extend by way of benefit to all pensioners, was a minimum pension, that is, 50% of the minimum pay in the 1996 revised scale of pay. NPA has no part to play in the minimum that is sought to be assured. NPA has relevance only for initial fixation of pension and not for stepping up pension under Circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 15\\. As a result, if the pension of a retiree is determined by taking into account NPA as part of 'pay' and the pension so determined is more than 50% of minimum pay in the revised scale of pay, he would continue to get such higher pension. This would happen in the case of all those who retired on or after 1.1.1996. If the pension determined by taking into account NPA as part of pay, is less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay, his pension would be stepped up to 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay. This would happen in the case of pre 1996 retirees.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 16\\. The petitioners want to read the words \"not less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay\" in the Circular dated 7.6.1999, as \"not less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay plus NPA\". When the language used is clear and unambiguous and the intention is also clear, it is not permissible to add words to the Circular dated 7.6.1999 to satisfy what petitioners consider to be just and reasonable. \"Minimum pay in the revised scale of pay\" refers only to the initial pay in the revised scale of pay and not anything more. Due to a misinterpretation, NPA was included for the purpose of giving the benefit of stepping up the pension in the case of retired medical officers. The fact that NPA had already been taken into account while calculating the 'existing pension' of the medical officers who retired before 1.1.1996 was lost sight of. The fact that NPA is part of 'pay' and not part of 'basic pay' was also overlooked. Therefore, it became necessary to issue the clarification, which was done by circular dated 11.9.2001, clarifying that it was impermissible to again add NPA to 'the minimum pay in the revised pay scale' for the purpose of stepping up the pension.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 17\\. Another grievance of the petitioners is that prior to circular dated 7.6.1999, the pay and pension of medical officers was always more than the pay and pension of non-medical officers of the same rank, in view of NPA element, and by virtue of the clarificatory circular dated 11.9.2001, the pension of both categories, (Medical Officers and non-Medical Officers), who retired prior to 1996, became equal. The petitioners contend that even after stepping up under Circular dated 7.6.1999, the disparity which earlier existed between Medical Officers and Non-Medical Officers of the same rank, should be maintained. They point out that if the pension of medical officers and non- medical officers of the same rank should be the same, the purpose of giving NPA as part of pay to Medical Officers was defeated and NPA became illusory. We cannot agree. When the purpose of stepping up pension is to ensure that all retirees of the same rank get pension which is not less than the prescribed minimum, it would be unjust for a section to say that merely because they were earlier enjoying a higher pension than others of the same rank, such disparity should be continued, even after stepping up.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: When the object of stepping up of pension is to bring in parity and avoid disparity, the claim of petitioners that disparity should be continued cannot be accepted.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 18\\. We, therefore, hold that circular dated 11.9.2001, is only a clarification to correct the wrong interpretation of the circular dated 7.6.1999. It neither amends nor modifies the circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: Re : Question No. (ii)\n",
      "Paragraph 50: 19\\. The petitioners next contend that in the case of Medical Officers who retired on or after 1.1.1996, even after the Circulars dated 7.6.1999 and 11.9.2001, NPA is added to basic pay for the purpose of calculating the pension, whereas in the case of pre 1996 retirees, NPA is not being added and that amounts to discrimination. This is a misleading contention. In the case of those retiring on or after 1.1.1996, NPA is added to basic pay, to determine their pension, and not for stepping up the pension. In the case of pre 1996 retirees, as NPA was already added while determining their pension, the question of adding it again, for purposes of stepping up the pension, does not arise.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 20\\. The principles relating to pension relevant to the issue are well settled.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: They are :\n",
      "Paragraph 53: a) In regard to pensioners forming a class, computation of pension cannot be by different formula thereby applying an unequal treatment solely on the ground that some retired earlier and some retired later. If the retiree is eligible for pension at the time of his retirement and the relevant pension scheme is subsequently amended, he would become eligible to get enhanced pension as per the new formula of computation of pension from the date when the amendment takes effect. In such a situation, the additional benefit under the amendment, made available to the same class of pensioners cannot be denied to him on the ground that he had retired prior to the date on which the aforesaid additional benefit was conferred.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: b) But all retirees retiring with a particular rank do not form a single class for all purposes. Where the reckonable emoluments as on the date of retirement (for the purpose of computation of pension) are different in respect of two groups of pensioners, who retired with the same rank, the group getting lesser pension cannot contend that their pension should be identical with or equal to the pension received by the group whose reckonable emolument was higher. In other words, pensioners who retire with the same rank need not be given identical pension, where their average reckonable emoluments at the time of their retirement were different, in view of the difference in pay, or in view of different pay scales being in force.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: c) When two sets of employees of the same rank retire at different points of time, it is not discrimination if :\n",
      "Paragraph 56: (i) when one set retired, there was no pension scheme and when the other set retired, a pension scheme was in force.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: (ii) when one set retired, a voluntary retirement scheme was in force and when the other set retired, such a scheme was not in force; or (iii) when one set retired, a PF scheme was applicable and when the other set retired, a pension scheme was in place.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: One set cannot claim the benefit extended to the other set on the ground that they are similarly situated. Though they retired with the same rank, they are not of the 'same class' or 'homogeneous group'. The employer can validly fix a cut-off date for introducing any new pension/retirement scheme or for discontinuance of any existing scheme. What is discriminatory is introduction of a benefit retrospectively (or prospectively) fixing a cut off date arbitrarily thereby dividing a single homogeneous class of pensioners into two groups and subjecting them to different treatment.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: [Vide [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]]\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 21\\. As noticed earlier, pension is determined with reference to the applicable rules/orders governing pension. The Ministry's Circular dated 7.6.1999 comes in, only to step up the pension from 1.1.1996, if the pension calculated in accordance with the rules/orders is less than 50% of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay introduced with effect from 1.1.1996. There is no need to step up the pension of those who retired on or after 1.1.1996, as their pension will be more than or in no event less than the minimum provided under the circular dated 7.6.1999. The stepping up is required only to those who retired prior to 1.1.1996 as their pension was lower on account of the fact that their reckonable emoluments for purpose of calculation of pension, was based on the old scales of pay. Let us take the case of a Medical Officer of the rank Lt. General, with 33 years of service, who retired in the year 1998 after getting two increments in the revised pay scale. As the applicable pay scale is Rs.22400-525-24500, his basic pay would have been Rs.23,450/- at the time of retirement. 25% thereof namely Rs.5863/- would be the NPA. If the reckonable emolument was Rs.29313/-, pension will be 50% thereof, namely Rs.14656/-. As the pension under the Rules (Rs.14656/-) was more than 50% of the minimum of revised pay scale (Rs.11200/-) assured under the circular dated 7.6.1999, the benefit of stepping up is not required in his case. It is only those whose pension was determined with reference to old scales of pay, and not the revised higher scale of pay, who require the benefit of the stepping up. Therefore, the contention that pre 1996 retirees and post 1.1.1996 retirees are being treated differently, is untenable. They are treated similarly. But the fact that post 1.1.1996 retirees do not require the benefit of stepping up, cannot by any stretch of imagination, give rise to a contention that the benefit given to pre- 1996 retirees by way of stepping up, amounts to discrimination.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 22\\. The contention that NPA is taken into account in the case of post 1.1.1996 retirees but not pre 1996 retirees is untenable. NPA is taken as part of 'pay' in the case of both pre and post 1.1.1996 retirees. NPA is not taken into account in the case of any retiree for applying the stepping up benefit under circular dated 7.6.1999. It is a different matter that post 1.1.1996 retirees do not require the benefit under the circular dated 7.6.1999. As already noticed, while calculating pension of the pre 1996 retirees, NPA had already been taken into account as part of 'pay', and that pension which was determined after taking into account NPA, is found to be less than the minimum guaranteed under the circular dated 7.6.1999, their pension is being increased to the minimum provided in the circular dated 7.6.1999.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: NPA cannot again be added to the minimum to step up the pension. If that is done, it will amount to taking NPA into account twice for purposes of pension, which is impermissible. The contention of discrimination between pre 1.1.1996 retirees and post 1.1.1996 retirees is, therefore, imaginary.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: Re : Question No. (iii)\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 23\\. It was alleged that in the case of civilian medical officers, the nodal Ministry had issued circulars dated 17.12.1998 and 29.10.1999 (corresponding to the Defence Ministry's Circulars dated 7.6.1999 and 11.9.2001); that some civilian Medical Officer Retirees had challenged the said circular dated 29.10.1999 directing that NPA shall not be added to minimum pay in the revised scale, before the Delhi High Court; that the High Court had allowed the said writ petitions (CWP No.7322/2001 and connected cases  K. G. Garg vs. Union of India) by order dated 18.5.2002;\n",
      "Paragraph 65: and that the said order was not challenged by the Union of India, but on the other hand, was implemented by adding NPA to basic pay while stepping up the pension in the case of civilian Medical Doctors who had retired prior to 1.1.1996. It is contended that the Respondents having accepted and implemented the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of civilian medical officers, cannot discriminate against the Defence service medical officers placed in identical position and therefore the benefit given to the civilian medical officers in pursuance of the decision of the Delhi High Court should also be extended to them. The petitioners rely on the broad principles underlying estoppel by Judgment, legitimate expectation, and fairness in action in support of their contention.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 24\\. Respondents have filed an affidavit dated 1.8.2006 admitting that in pursuance of the decision of the Delhi High Court, the circular dated 29.10.999 had been withdrawn but clarified that it was withdrawn only in regard to the civilian medical officers who were petitioners in the said writ petititions and not in regard to all civilian medical officers. It is contended that the fact that a decision of the High Court had been accepted or implemented in the case of some persons, will not come in the way of the Union of India resisting similar petitions filed by others, in public interest.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 25\\. A similar contention was considered by this Court in [?CITATION?] This Court held :\n",
      "Paragraph 68: \"Sometimes, as it was stated on behalf of the State, the State Government may not choose to file appeals against certain judgments of the High Court rendered in Writ petitions when they are considered as stray cases and not worthwhile invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution, for seeking redressal therefor. At other times, it is also possible for the State, not to file appeals before this Court in some matters on account of improper advice or negligence or improper conduct of officers concerned. It is further possible, that even where S.L.Ps are filed by the State against judgments of High Court, such S.L.Ps may not be entertained by this Court in exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution either because they are considered as individual cases or because they are considered as cases not involving stakes which may adversely affect the interest of the State.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: Therefore, the circumstance of the non-filing of the appeals by the State in some similar matters or the rejection of some S.L.Ps in limine by this Court in some other similar matters by itself, in our view, cannot be held as a bar against the State in filing an S.L.P. or S.L.Ps in other similar matters where it is considered on behalf of the State that non-filing of such S.L.P. or S.L.Ps and pursuing them is likely to seriously jeopardize the interest of the State or public interest.\" The said observations apply to this case. A particular judgment of the High Court may not be challenged by the State where the financial repercussions are negligible or where the appeal is barred by limitation. It may also not be challenged due to negligence or oversight of the dealing officers or on account of wrong legal advice, or on account of the non-comprehension of the seriousness or magnitude of the issue involved. However, when similar matters subsequently crop up and the magnitude of the financial implications is realized, the State is not prevented or barred from challenging the subsequent decisions or resisting subsequent writ petitions, even though judgment in a case involving similar issue was allowed to reach finality in the case of others. Of course, the position would be viewed differently, if petitioners plead and prove that the State had adopted a 'pick and choose' method only to exclude petitioners on account of malafides or ulterior motives. Be that as it may. On the facts and circumstances, neither the principle of res judicata nor the principle of estoppel is attracted. The Administrative Law principles of legitimate expectation or fairness in action are also not attracted. Therefore, the fact that in some cases the validity of the circular dated 29.10.1999 (corresponding to the Defence Ministry circular dated 11.9.2001) has been upheld and that decision has attained finality will not come in the way of State defending or enforcing its circular dated 11.9.2001.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: Re : Question No. (iv)\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 25\\. The last question to be considered is whether relief should be granted against the recovery of the excess payments made on account of the wrong interpretation/understanding of the circular dated 7.6.1999. This Court has consistently granted relief against recovery of excess wrong payment of emoluments/allowances from an employee, if the following conditions are fulfilled [Vide [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], and [?CITATION?]] :\n",
      "Paragraph 72: a) The excess payment was not made on account of any misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the employee.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: b) Such excess payment was made by the employer by applying a wrong principle for calculating the pay/allowance or on the basis of a particular interpretation of rule/order, which is subsequently found to be erroneous.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: Such relief, restraining recovery back of excess payment, is granted by courts not because of any right in the employees, but in equity, in exercise of judicial discretion, to relieve the employees, from the hardship that will be caused if recovery is implemented. A Government servant, particularly one in the lower rungs of service would spend whatever emoluments he receives for the upkeep of his family. If he receives an excess payment for a long period, he would spend it genuinely believing that he is entitled to it. As any subsequent action to recover the excess payment will cause undue hardship to him, relief is granted in that behalf. But where the employee had knowledge that the payment received was in excess of what was due or wrongly paid, or where the error is detected or corrected within a short time of wrong payment, Courts will not grant relief against recovery. The matter being in the realm of judicial discretion, courts may on the facts and circumstances of any particular case refuse to grant such relief against recovery.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 26\\. On the same principle, pensioners can also seek a direction that wrong payments should not be recovered, as pensioners are in a more disadvantageous position when compared to in-service employees. Any attempt to recover excess wrong payment would cause undue hardship to them. The petitioners are not guilty of any misrepresentation or fraud in regard to the excess payment. NPA was added to minimum pay, for purposes of stepping up, due to a wrong understanding by the implementing departments. We are therefore of the view that Respondents shall not recover any excess payments made towards pension in pursuance of circular dated 7.6.1999 till the issue of the clarificatory circular dated 11.9.2001. In so far as any excess payment made after the circular dated 11.9.2001, obviously the Union of India will be entitled to recover the excess as the validity of the said circular has been upheld and as pensioners have been put on notice in regard to the wrong calculations earlier made.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 27\\. A faint attempt was made by the learned Addl. Solicitor General appearing for Respondent to contend that all such wrong payments could be recovered and at best the pensioners may be entitled to time or instalments to avoid hardship. No doubt in [?CITATION?], this Court did not bar the recovery of excess pay, but directed recovery in easy instalments. The said decision does not lay down a principle that relief from recovery should not be granted in regard to emoluments wrongly paid in excess, or that only relief in such cases is grant of instalments. A direction to recover the excess payment in instalments or a direction not to recover excess payment, is made as a consequential direction, after the main issue relating to the validity of the order refixing or reducing the pay/allowance/pension is decided. In some cases, the petitioners may merely seek quashing of the order refixing the pay and may not seek any consequential relief. In some cases, the petitioners may make a supplementary prayer seeking instalments in regard to refund of the excess payment if the validity of the order refixing the pay is upheld. In some other cases, the petitioners may pray that such excess payments should not be recovered. The grant of consequential relief would, therefore, depend upon the consequential prayer made. If the consequential prayer was not for waiving the excess payment but only for instalments, the court would obviously consider only the prayer for instalments. If any decision which upholds the refixation of pay/pension does not contain any consequential direction not to recover the excess payment already made or contains a consequential direction to recover the excess payment in instalments, it is not thereby laying down any proposition of law but is merely issuing consequential direction in exercise of judicial discretion, depending upon the prayer for consequential relief or absence of prayer for consequential relief as the case may be, and the facts and circumstances of the case. Many a time, the prayer for instalments or waiver of recovery of excess, is made not in the pleadings but during arguments or when the order is dictated upholding the order revising or re-fixating the pay/pension. Therefore, the decision in Sujatha Vedachalam (supra) will not come in the way of relief being granted to the pensioners in regard to the recovery of excess payments.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 28\\. The learned Additional Solicitor General next submitted that in so far as refund of the excess pension relating to the period 11.9.2001 to date, the petitioners who have obtained interim orders of stay, should be made liable to pay interest, as the petitioners had the benefit of such excess payment.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: Reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court in [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]. It is no doubt true that the petitioners, who have obtained orders of interim stay, have been receiving excess pension even after the clarification contained in the Circular dated 11.9.2001 and that they are bound to refund the excess received after 11.9.2001. But there was some amount of confusion on account of the earlier interpretation of the Circular dated 7.6.1999 by the Department itself. Further, the petitioners are all pensioners, who have prosecuted these petitions bonafide. In the circumstances, on the facts and circumstances, we do not propose to award of interest on the amounts to be refunded.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: Conclusion :\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 29\\. The Circulars dated 7.6.1999 and 11.9.2001 relate not only to pension but also family pension, the only difference being the percentage, that is, 30% is mentioned in respect of family pension instead of 50% in respect of pension. What we have discussed and held in respect of pension will apply to family pension also.\n",
      "Paragraph 81: 30\\. In view of the above, the challenge to the validity of the circular dated 11.9.2001 is rejected. These petitions (Transferred Cases) are dismissed. The Respondents, however, shall not recover the excess, if any, paid to the petitioners between 7.6.1999 and 11.9.2001. Respondents may recover the excess if any paid after 11.9.2001 in appropriate monthly instalments approximately equal to the monthly excess payment. Parties to bear respective costs.\n",

Notice of the said petition was given to the UOI who filed an application under Sections 30 and 33 of the Act raising certain objections against the Award. The objections filed by the UOI were rejected by the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Vasco-da-Gama vide judgment dated 8th April, 1996 and the Award dated 28th February, 1994 of the Arbitrator was made Rule of the Court with a further direction to the UOI to pay the contractor simple interest @ 18% p.a. on the principal amount adjudged in the Award from the date of the decree till the date of actual payment. Against the said order the UOI filed appeals before the High Court under Section 39 of the Act. The High Court by the judgment rendered on 29th February, 2000 allowed the appeals in part. The operative portion of the judgment reads as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 82: \"For the aforesaid reasons, the appeals are partly allowed. The claim for quantity of stone aggregate already brought after August, 1992 upto 20-4-1994 in Arbitration Appeal No.2 of 1996 and Arbitration Appeal No.3 of 1996 to the tune of Rs.11,35,760/- and Rs.5,90,000/-, respectively, is sustained. The interest awarded on the said claim by the Arbitrator is also sustained.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: Except for this, the remaining claims granted by the Arbitrator are set aside. In the facts and circumstances, we shall leave the parties to bear their costs.\" The High Court declined to interfere with the Award of the Arbitrator relating to claim Item No.1 upto 24.1.1994 when the statement of claims was filed before him by the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: The High Court held that the Award in respect of claim no.1 beyond 24-1-94 did not form part of the terms of reference and further that the future claim in respect of stone aggregate would be subject to various factors including market conditions and whether the shortage continued. The High Court further held that under the circumstances, the Arbitrator could not have granted relief relating to future claim of the contractor with reference to stone aggregate.\n",
      "Paragraph 85: The High Court recorded the following finding in this regard:- \"Therefore, while sustaining claim no.1 in both the appeals for the quantity of stone aggregate already brought after August 1992 upto 24-1-1994, and Award of Rs.11,35,760/- in Arbitration Appeal No.2 of 1996 and Rs.5,90,000/- in Arbitration Appeal No.3 of 1996, the remaining part of Order on claim no.1 is set aside.\" [See page 31 para 21 last portion] On claim no.2 the High Court interpreted clauses 3.3.2, 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 of the contract and held that excavation in any type of laterite rock, that is to say, soft or hard shall be treated as excavation in soft/disintegrated rock. The High Court further held that the Arbitrator had totally overlooked Clause 3.3.4 while coming to the conclusion on the basis of Clauses 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 alone. The High Court was of the view that the Arbitrator had not only misinterpreted the relevant clauses totally ignoring the Clause 3.3.4, but had also taken 'undue' interest in the matter in order to find out the classification of the strata which in fact, in view of Clause 3.3.4 would not have much relevance. The High Court held that the Arbitrator had misconducted himself and therefore, the Award against claim no.2 was totally unwarranted and invalid. According to the High Court, the view taken by the Arbitrator could not be said to be a possible view on the interpretation of Clauses 3.3.2, 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 read together. The High Court summed up its finding as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 86: \"For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the opinion that the Award under claim no.2 in both the Appeals cannot be sustained and is liable to be set aside.\" [see para 25 at page 36] In respect of claim no.3, the High Court took note of Clauses 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.3 of the Special Conditions in which provisions were made for inspection of the site prior to the filing of tender so that the tenderer was familiar with the working conditions, accessibility to site of works, etc. Regarding the security and passes to the persons who were required to enter the area in connection with the work in Special Condition 3.3 it was clearly stated that nothing extra shall be admissible for any man hours etc. lost on this account of the restrictions referred to under Special Condition no.3. The High Court held that the contractor had filed the tender knowing fully well the relevant provisions of the Special Conditions in the contract and as such he could not later on complain about such restrictions leading to reduced output of labourers, restricted working hours etc. The High Court opined that the conclusions arrived at by the Arbitrator were contrary to relevant Special Conditions which were part of the contract and as such, the Award of the claim under the said Award could not be sustained. Regarding claim no.4 which relates to interest, the High Court relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in [?CITATION?], held that: \"the Arbitrator has jurisdiction to award pre-reference interest in cases which arose after the [Interest Act, 1978] and the power of the arbitrator to award interest for the post-award period also exists, besides power to grant pendente lite interest\".\n",
      "Paragraph 87: The High Court found that the interest awarded by the arbitrator in relation to the claim for quantity of stone aggregate already brought after August, 1992 to 20-4-1994 could not be interfered with and that the pre-reference interest in respect of other items falls on account of rejection of claim nos.2 and 3. On such findings the High Court allowed the appeal in part and to the extent noted earlier.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: Shri V.A.Mohta, learned senior counsel appearing for the contractor i.e. the appellants in Appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.10526-527/2000 and respondents in Appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.880-881 of 2001, strenuously contended that the High Court exceeded the limits of the jurisdiction vested under Section 39 of the Act in deciding the appeals filed by the UOI, and in setting aside the Award of the Arbitrator in respect of claim nos.2 and 3. Shri Mohta further contended that even assuming that the High Court found that the arbitrator had mis-interpreted the relevant clauses of the agreement, then it was not open to it to interfere with the Award since there was no error of law apparent on the face of the award and the matter relating to interpretation of the conditions in the agreement was within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: Shri Anoop G.Chaudhary, learned senior counsel appearing for the UOI contended that the award of the arbitrator so far as part of the claim no.1 and claim nos.2 and 3 are concerned was contrary to the specific conditions provided in the agreement, and therefore, was patently erroneous and uncalled for. Shri Chaudhary further contended that the arbitrator being a creature of the agreement could not ignore the relevant stipulations in the contract nor could he travel beyond the terms of the contract. In the circumstances, Shri Chaudhary submitted, the judgment of the High Court does not call for interference by this Court in the appeal filed by the contractor under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.\n",

Only certain types of orders are made appealable under the provision. Being a special statute no appeal can be entertained except under Section 39. The principles on which the Court can interfere with an award or order passed under the Act are fairly well settled.

      "Paragraph 101: In the case of [?CITATION?], this Court, construing Section 30 of the Act, observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 102: \"The law on this aspect is, however, settled.\n",
      "Paragraph 103: In [?CITATION?], this Court reiterated that in order to make arbitration effective and the awards enforceable, machinery was devised by the [Arbitration Act] for lending the assistance of the ordinary courts. The court was also entrusted with the power to modify or correct the award on the ground of imperfect form or clerical errors, or decision on questions not referred, which were severable from those referred. The Court had also power to remit the award when it had left some matters referred undetermined, or when the award was indefinite, where the objection to the legality of the award was apparent on the face of the award. The court might also set aside an award on the ground of corruption or misconduct of the arbitrator, or that a party had been guilty of fraudulent concealment or willful deception. But the court could not interfere with the award if otherwise proper on the ground that the decision appeared to it to be erroneous. The award of the arbitrator was ordinarily final and conclusive, unless a contrary intention was disclosed by the agreement. The award was the decision of a domestic tribunal chosen by the parties, and the civil courts which were entrusted with the power to facilitate arbitration and to effectuate the awards, could not exercise appellate powers over the decision. Wrong or right the decision was binding, if it be reached fairly after giving adequate opportunity to the parties to place their grievances in the manner provided by the arbitration agreement. This Court reiterated in the said decision that it was now firmly established that an award was bad on the ground of error of law on the face of it, when in the award itself or in a document actually incorporated in it, there was found some legal proposition which was the basis of the award and which was erroneous.\" This Court in the case of [?CITATION?], considered the reasons given in a speaking award and scope for the interference with such award.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: This Court in that connection made the following observations :\n",
      "Paragraph 105: \"In this case the reasons given by the arbitrator are cogent and based on materials on record. In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, Fourth Edition, page 2258 states that it would be unreasonable to expect an exact definition of the word \"reasonable\". Reason varies in its conclusions according to the idiosyncrasy of the individual, and the times and circumstances in which he thinks. The reasoning which built up the old scholastic logic sounds now like the jingling of a child's toy. But mankind must be satisfied with the reasonableness within reach; and in cases not covered by authority, the verdict of a jury or the decision of a judge sitting as a jury usually determines what is \"reasonable\" in each particular case. The word \"reasonable\" has in law the prima facie meaning of reasonable in regard to those circumstances of which the actor, called on to act reasonably, knows or ought to know. See the observations, in Re a Solicitor [?CITATION?] at 371.\n",
      "Paragraph 106: After all an arbitrator as a judge in the words of Benjamin N.Cardozo, has to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinated to \"the primordial necessity of order in the social life\".\n",
      "Paragraph 107: In the case of [?CITATION?], construing Section 30 of the Act, this Court observed that the award can be set aside if the arbitrator had mis-conducted himself or the proceedings and had proceeded beyond his jurisdiction; that these are separate and distinct grounds for challenging an award; that where there are errors apparent on the face of the award it can only be set aside if in the award there is any proposition of law which is apparent on the face of the award, namely, in the award itself or any document incorporated in the award.\n",
      "Paragraph 108: Reference was made to the decision of the Judicial Committee in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 109: Considering the point that only in a speaking award a Court can look into the reasoning of the award, this Court observed : \"..It is not open to the court to probe the mental process of the arbitrator and speculate, where no reasons are given by the arbitrator, as to what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at his conclusion\". In this connection reference was made to the observations in [?CITATION?]. Drawing a distinction between the disputes as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that jurisdiction should be exercised, this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 110: \"An award may be remitted or set aside on the ground that the arbitrator in making it, had exceeded his jurisdiction and evidence of matters not appearing on the face of it, will be admitted in order to establish whether the jurisdiction had been exceeded or not, because the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside the award whatever might be said about it in the award or by the arbitration.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: See in this connection, the observations of Russel on The Law of Arbitration, 20th edn., p.427. Also see the observations of [?CITATION?], 10 and [?CITATION?]. It has to be reiterated that an arbitrator acting beyond his jurisdiction is a different ground from the error apparent on the face of the award. In Halbury's Laws of England II, 4th edn., Vol.2, para 622 one of the misconducts enumerated, is the decision by the arbitrator on a matter which is not included in the agreement or reference.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: But in such a case one has to determine the distinction between an error within the jurisdiction and an error in excess of the jurisdiction. See the observations in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?], and [?CITATION?] But, in the instant case the court had examined the different claims not to find out whether these claims were within the disputes referable to the arbitrator, but to find out whether in arriving at the decision, the arbitrator had acted correctly or incorrectly. This, in our opinion, the court had no jurisdiction to do, namely, substitution of its own evaluation of the conclusion of law or fact to come to the conclusion that the arbitrator had acted contrary to the bargain between the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 113: Whether a particular amount was liable to be paid or damages liable to be sustained, was a decision within the competency of the arbitrator in this case. By purporting to construe the contract the court could not take upon itself the burden of saying that this was contrary to the contract and, as such, beyond jurisdiction. It has to be determined that there is a distinction between disputes as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that power of the arbitrator to grant a particular remedy.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: Xxx xxx xxx In the instant case, the High Court seems to have fallen into an error of deciding the question on interpretation of the contract. In the aforesaid view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the High Court was in error.\n",
      "Paragraph 115: It may be stated that if on a view taken of a contract, the decision of the arbitrator on certain amounts awarded, is a possible view though perhaps not the only correct view, the award cannot be examined by the court in the manner done by the High Court in the instant case.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: In light of the above, the High Court, in our opinion, had no jurisdiction to examine the different items awarded clause by clause by the arbitrator and to hold that under the contract these were not sustainable in the facts found by the arbitrator.\" In the case of [?CITATION?], this Court considering the point on lack of jurisdiction of the arbitrator held that when the conditions in the agreement specifically prohibited granting claim or damages for the breaches mentioned therein it was not open to the arbitrator to ignore the said conditions which were binding on the contracting parties; that by ignoring the same he has acted beyond the jurisdiction upon him;\n",
      "Paragraph 117: that it is settled law that the arbitrator derives authority from the contract and if he acts in manifest disregard of the contract, the award given by him would be an arbitrary one; that this deliberate departure from the contract amounts not only to manifest disregard of the authority or misconduct on his part, but it may tantamount to mala fide action. This Court further observed that the [Arbitration Act] does not give any power to the arbitrator to act arbitrarily or capriciously; that his existence depends upon the agreement and his function is to act within the limits of the said agreement. In para 17 of the judgment this Court made the following observations :\n",
      "Paragraph 118: \"It is to be reiterated that to find out whether the arbitrator has traveled beyond his jurisdiction and acted beyond the terms of the agreement between the parties, the agreement is required to be looked into. It is true that interpretation of a particular condition in the agreement would be within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. However, in cases where there is no question of interpretation of any term of the contract, but of solely reading the same as it is and still the arbitrator ignores it and awards the amount despite the prohibition in the agreement, the award would be arbitrary, capricious and without jurisdiction.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: Whether the arbitrator has acted beyond the terms of the contract or has traveled beyond his jurisdiction would depend upon facts, which however would be jurisdictional facts, and are required to be gone into by the court. The arbitrator may have jurisdiction to entertain claim and yet he may not have jurisdiction to pass award for particular items in view of the prohibition contained in the contract and, in such cases, it would be a jurisdictional error. For this limited purpose reference to the terms of the contract is a must. Dealing with a similar question this Court in [?CITATION?], held thus : (SCC p.79 para 9) \"It is axiomatic that the arbitrator being a creature of the agreement, must operate within the four corners of the agreement and cannot travel beyond it. More particularly, he cannot award any amount which is ruled out or prohibited by the terms of the agreement. In this case, the agreement between the parties clearly says that in measuring the built-up area, the balcony areas should be excluded. The arbitrators could not have acted contrary to the said stipulation and awarded any amount to the appellant on that account.\" In the case of [?CITATION?], this Court considered the question of Courts interference in case of a non-speaking award. This Court referred to the decision in New India Civil Erectors (P) Ltd (supra) in which it was held that the arbitrator being a creature of the contract must operate within the four corners of the contract cannot travel beyond it and he cannot award any amount which is ruled out or prohibited by the terms of the agreement and the decision in [?CITATION?], in which it was held that if the arbitrator commits an error in the construction of the contract, that is an error within his jurisdiction; but if he wanders outside the contract and deals with matter not allotted to him, he commits a jurisdictional error and an umpire or arbitrator cannot widen his jurisdiction by deciding a question not referred to him by the parties or by deciding a question otherwise than in accordance with the contract. This Court referring to [?CITATION?], held that the principle was unexceptionable. Summing up its decision, this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 120: \"However, from a reading of the decisions of this Court referred to earlier it is clear that when an award is made plainly contrary to the terms of the contract not by misinterpretation but which is plainly contrary to the terms of the contract it would certainly lead to an inference that there is an error apparent on the face of the award which results in jurisdictional error in the award. In such a case the courts can certainly interfere with the award made by the arbitrator.\" Considering the scope of Section 30 of the Act, this Court in the case of [?CITATION?], enumerated some of the well recognized grounds on which interference in award is permissible, observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 121: \"Interpreting the statutory provision courts have laid stress on the limitations on exercise of jurisdiction by the court for setting aside or interfering with an award in umpteen cases. Some of the well-recognised grounds on which interference is permissible are:\n",
      "Paragraph 122: (1) violation of the principle of natural justice in passing the award;\n",
      "Paragraph 123: (2) error apparent on the face of the award;\n",
      "Paragraph 124: (3) the arbitrator has ignored or deliberately violated a clause in the agreement prohibiting dispute of the nature entertained;\n",
      "Paragraph 125: (4) the award on the fact of it is based on a proposition of law which is erroneous etc.\" Testing the case on hand on the touchstone of well settled principles laid down by Courts, we are unable to hold that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering with the award or failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it to set aside the award. The approach of the High Court cannot be said to be contrary to the well settled principles governing the scope of interference with an award of the Arbitrator under the old Act. As regards the first item, the question was whether the contract contemplates the use of stone aggregate and stone metal from the local sources only, the source of supply being silent in the relevant clause. The Arbitrator was of the view that the unprecedented situation of the contractor being put to the necessity of procuring the stone material from far off places was not visualized and the parties proceeded on the basis that such material was available locally. He further noted that the sample kept in the office of the concerned Engineer admittedly pertained to the material procured from local sources. A letter addressed by the Chief Engineer in support of contractor's claim was also relied on in this context. Hence, in these circumstances, the Arbitrator can be said to have taken a reasonably possible view and therefore the High Court rightly declined to set aside the award in so far as the quantity of stone aggregate/stone metal brought to site up to 24.1.1994 is concerned. The Arbitrator acted within the confines of his jurisdiction in making the award on this part of the claim.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: As already noted, the award in so far as the future period is concerned, i.e. subsequent to 24.1.1994 which is the date of filing of claim statement, the High Court set aside the award on two grounds : (i) Such a claim did not form part of terms of reference, though the contractor had filed claim in respect of stone aggregate to be brought in future and (ii) the future claim in respect of stone aggregate would be subject to various factors including market conditions and whether the shortage continued.\n",
      "Paragraph 127: In our view the view taken by the High Court cannot be sustained. It is clear from the arbitration clause viz.\n",
      "Paragraph 128: clause 70 that all disputes between the parties to the contract (other than excepted matters) can be referred to arbitration. The contractor did make a claim in respect of future period also. The document appointing the Arbitrator would show that the Arbitrator was required to decide the disputes arising between the parties. It is not possible to hold that the claim No.1 in so far as it relates to future period during which the contract work continued is beyond the scope of reference or outside the ambit of arbitration clause. The aim of arbitration is to settle all the disputes between the parties and to avoid further litigation. There is no legal justification in restricting the scope of arbitration in the manner in which the High Court did. In the list of disputes which is annexed to the letter of appointment of the Arbitrator, it is mentioned without any qualification or restriction as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 129: \"Reimbursement of additional cost in procurement of stone aggregate from crusher of Belgaum, Hubli, etc. in lieu of local sources of Goa.\" The claim amount is mentioned as 36 lakhs and 8 lakhs. This figure is over and above the amount claimed upto 24.1.1994 and is based on an estimate. It is also relevant to mention that Union of India did not take the stand before the Arbitrator that the claim in respect of future was beyond the scope of reference. However, in order to obviate any controversy, it is made clear that the payment at the rates specified in the award should be made only in respect of stone aggregate actually brought to the site from Belgaum, Hubli and other distant places. It is open to the Engineer concerned to be satisfied on this aspect before satisfying the award. Obviously, if any part of the stone aggregate was brought subsequent to 24.1.1994 from local sources the directions in the award will be ineffective. The observations of the High Court that conditions may not be the same for the future and therefore the Arbitrator was incompetent to make an award for the future period cannot be supported for the simple reason that the extra rate will become applicable only in respect of quantities brought from sources other than local. It has never been the case of Union of India either before the Arbitrator or the High Court or even this Court that the situation had changed after 24.1.1994 and that the stone aggregate could be secured at lesser rates from local sources or otherwise. For all these reasons, we are of the view that the High Court ought not to have interfered with the award in so far as claim No.1 is concerned in any respect. To this extent, the appeals filed by the Contractor i.e. arising out of SLP Nos. 10526- 10527 of 2000 are partly allowed.\n",
      "Paragraph 130: As regards the other two items viz. 2 and 3, on a perusal of the judgment of the High Court and on consideration of the relevant clauses, we are of the view that the judgment does not suffer from any serious error in the approach to the matter. In regard to item No.2, though the High Court may not be justified in observing that the Arbitrator took undue interest in trying to ascertain the classification of strata, the High Court is well justified in holding that the view taken by the Arbitrator is not at all a reasonably possible view and in fact he ignored one of the relevant clauses, namely, 3.3.4. The Arbitrator was carried away by the fact that chiselling had to be done in view of the hardness of rock. The Arbitrator at the same time did not choose to give a finding that what was encountered by the contractor was something other than laterite rock which is mentioned in the Agreement. As regards the 3rd item, the Arbitrator again ignored the relevant clauses in the agreement and came to the perverse conclusion that the site became restricted on account of certain security measures enforced in the area. The award of sum vis--vis this item is clearly outside the terms of contract. The High Court, therefore, rightly set aside the award on this aspect.\n",
      "Paragraph 131: On the discussions in the foregoing paragraphs the appeals arising from S.L.P. Nos.10526-27 of 2000 filed by the contractor are allowed in part to the extent noted earlier and the appeals arising from S.L.P. Nos.880-881 of 2001 filed by Union of India & another are dismissed.\n",
      "Paragraph 132: There will, however, be no order for costs.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: \n"

      "Paragraphs:\n",
      "Paragraph 1: BACKGROUND FACTS:\n",
      "Paragraph 2: 'Nilgiris' is a hill district in the State of Tamil Nadu. Mettupalayam is a small town situate in Nilgiris.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: The villagers of the surrounding villages for their livelihood depend on growing of vegetables and tea. With a view to see that the small vegetable growers are not exploited by the vegetable merchants, a society known as 'Nilgiris Cooperative Marketing Society Limited' (Society for short) was formed as far back as in 1935 with only 116 members.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: The Society, however, grew in course of time and at present it has about 22000 members. The memberships of the Society are of two categories. In the first category only the vegetable or food growers, agricultural cooperative credit societies and agricultural improvement societies are A-class members having voting rights; whereas traders, commission agents and merchants dealing in the commodities grown by the agriculturists are classified as B-class members. They have no right to vote or participate in the management of the Society. The B-class members only, however, are entitled to take part in auctions held in the marketing yards of the Society. Any dispute between the seller member and the purchaser member is resolved through arbitration in terms of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1961.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: The land holdings of the members of the society varies from 1/4th acre to five acres averaging two acres per member. They mainly depend on the rainfall as irrigational facilities are not available. The small farmers are economically weak and have no holding power. Many of them have to take loans for their subsistence, when the weather is not good. Many of them are illiterate. The vegetables produced from their lands being subjected to the vagaries of the weather, the merchants with a view to pressurize them either used to force them to sell that at a very low price or would make them wait for days so that the vegetables become useless. The majority of the members belong to 'Badaga' community which had been declared to be a backward class by the Government of Tamil Nadu. Mettupalayam is a centre for potatoes and vegetables trade.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: The Society has two big marketing yards at Mettupalayam. In the said yards, auction of vegetables takes place. Infrastructure therefor such as offices, godowns yards, weighing machines etc. are provided by the Society. There are two separate yards with pucca godowns, one for potatoes and another for vegetables. The primary members of the Society bring their agricultural produce to the yards by hired lorries or trucks. They remain present till the agricultural produce brought by them is auction- sold and they receive the sale price. The number of primary members visiting the marketing yards of the Society, depending upon the season varies from 100 to 200 members per day. The number of merchants coming to purchase these commodities also varies from 30 to 100. The Society provides for accommodation to the members on a nominal rent.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: It also provides dormitory type of accommodation free of charge. The months of July to October of year are said to be a peak season. Whereas during the peak season about 100 lorries arrive everyday; during the 'off season' average number of lorries arriving at the yard would be around 10.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: For the purpose of bringing potatoes gunny bags are supplied by the Society free of cost.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: The following main jobs are carried out in the said premises:\n",
      "Paragraph 10: i) unloading of the gunny bags containing potatoes from the lorries;\n",
      "Paragraph 11: ii) unpacking the gunny bags and keeping the potatoes in lots inside the godown;\n",
      "Paragraph 12: iii) grading the potatoes into different sorts;\n",
      "Paragraph 13: iv) weighing the auctioned potatoes in 45 kgs.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: and packing them into gunny bags brought by the merchants;\n",
      "Paragraph 15: v) stitching the gunny bags and loading them into lorries hired by the merchants.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: Throughout the process, lots brought by the primary members are kept separate with clear demarcation as regard the ownership theref. Sometimes small farmers unload the bags of potatoes themselves; some of them bring their potatoes upon proper grading in their farms and place it in the yard in a sorted condition. However, if proper grading is not done by the vegetable growers, they are graded into the different sorts.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: The number of persons undertaking the job varies depending upon the quantum of work.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Admittedly an industrial dispute was raised by 407 persons; of whom 73 are potters and 335 are graders. The job of unloading, unpacking of gunny bags, stitching the gunny bags and putting them into lorries are done by porters whereas gradation of potatoes, weighing the auctioned potatoes in 45 kgs. and packing them into gunny bags are done by graders. Most of them are women.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: It is stated that the members of the Society or their authorized representatives remain present throughout the auction. The auction is confirmed only with the consent of the members. The member has a right to decline to sell his produce, if he is not satisfied with the highest rate offered by the merchants and is entitled to hold over the same till the next auction takes place.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: The Society contends that for doing various items of work in the yards, services of certain third parties are made available to the members. They are always available in the yards and any member whether producer or merchant may engage them. The work is done through the workers of the concerned third parties. Payment therefor is to be made by the persons engaging them to the said third parties (contractors). However, sometimes as the producer members may not have enough money with them, the Society makes the payment on their behalf by way of advance, wherefor allegedly written authority is obtained. The Society further contends that the farmers and merchants are at liberty to engage their own men for doing these items of work and some of them do the work themselves. There is no obligation on the part of the member to bring his produce to the Society's yards. He is free to sell is produce in any manner thought it.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: It is not in dispute that the Society does not maintain any attendance register or wages register. The third parties are free to engage men of their own choice and no working hours are fixed or insisted. Any person normally doing the job may come on any day to work. The third parties engage more number of persons during peak season and during lean season less number of persons are engaged. The porters and graders may take up any other job.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES:\n",
      "Paragraph 23: The appellant-Union, however, on or about 19.4. 1982 served a charter of demands upon the Society claiming, inter alia, permanency in service and other benefits. A strike notice was also given wherefor a conciliation proceeding was initiated. The Society thereafter filed a suit being O.S.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: No.2293 of 1982. A writ petition was filed before this Court being W.P. No.23 of 1983 praying for minimum facilities like drinking water, toilet, rest-room, maternity benefits etc. The Society is said to have declared a lock out and a conciliation proceeding thereupon started again.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: The writ petition was thereafter withdrawn. The conciliation proceeding ended in a failure.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: REFERENCE:\n",
      "Paragraph 27: On or about 19.5.1984, the State of Tamil Nadu issued a notification in exercise of its power under Section 10(1)(d) of the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] referring the following disputes for adjudication of the Industrial Tribunal :\n",
      "Paragraph 28: \"i) Whether the non-employment of the workmen referred in the reference is justified ? ii) To what relief ?\" PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL:\n",
      "Paragraph 29: In the aforementioned industrial reference before the Tribunal, witnesses were examined on behalf of the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: Documents were also produced. By reason of an award dated 5.9.1989, the Tribunal opined that there did not exist any relationship of employer and employee between the Society and the concerned persons, observing :\n",
      "Paragraph 31: \"36. In view of the above finding, if we approach this case, there is no convincing evidence placed by the petitioner to establish the master and servant relationship to hold that the persons referred in this dispute are only workmen of the Respondent-Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 37\\. Viewed from any angle, either on facts or on law, the petitioner-Union has not substantiated that the persons mentioned in the Annexure are workmen and therefore their non-employment is not justified. Hence this point is found against the Petitioner Union.\" On the said findings the reference was rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE HIGH COURT:\n",
      "Paragraph 34: Aggrieved thereby the appellant preferred a writ petition before the High Court marked as Writ Petition No.14659 of 1989.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: During the pendency of the said proceeding, other disputes also ensued resulting in closure of the yards;\n",
      "Paragraph 36: whereafter, again conciliation proceedings were initiated on or about 3.8.1985. The respondent-Society issued an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper inviting tenders for operations. Questioning the said action on the part of the Society, a writ petition was filed in the Madras High Court which was marked as W.P. No.9333 of 1985 praying therein for issuance of writ of mandamus directing the State to prohibit introduction of contract labour system in the Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: Another writ petition being W.P. No.9334 of 1985 was also filed wherein the petitioners prayed for issuance of a writ of or in the nature of mandamus directing the Society not to engage contract labour purported to be on the ground that the same is contrary to Sections 25-O and 25-T of the [Industrial Disputes Act] and Sections 7 and 12 of the [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970].\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Certain interim orders were passed by the High Court and some appeals were also filed and the matter came up before this Court also, being Civil Appeal No.5381 of 1985 on or about 26.9.1986 wherein this Court passed the following order :\n",
      "Paragraph 39: \"On behalf of the Marketing Society, Dr. Y.S. Chitale, learned Counsel assures us that hereafter workmen will not be permitted to be employed by contractors to work within the yard of the Society. He also assures us that the 407 workers previously employed may come back and work in the yard without any objection. It is open to any worker to go and seek employment, but contractors will be excluded. The case now pending before Industrial Tribunal may be disposed of expeditiously. Civil Misc. Petition is disposed of accordingly.\" By another interim order passed in Writ Petition No.19310 and 19311 of 1986, a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court directed :\n",
      "Paragraph 40: \"The third respondent shall give employment directly to all the 407 workers. If, after providing employment to these 407 workers, any more lands are required, then the management is free to give employment to such of these persons. The Collector of Coimbatore will see to it that the order of the Supreme Court extracted above is implemented in its true spirit.\" In an appeal carried out by the Society being W.A. No.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 1372 of 1986, the High Court of Madras issued the following directions :\n",
      "Paragraph 42: \"Apparently it appears to us that the order made by the learned single Judge runs counter to the order of the Supreme Court dated 4.12.1985. Therefore, the order of the learned Single Judge is stayed. Since the order which is in controversy is that of the Supreme Court, this is eminently a fit case where the parties are at liberty to get necessary clarification from the Supreme Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: Till the order is clarified by the Supreme Court, if the parties approach the Supreme Court for this, the appellant will implement the order dated 4.12.1985 by way of an interim arrangement.\" On an application, this Court by an order dated 13.4.1987, observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 44: \"The interim arrangement will continue till disposal of the writ petition in the High Court. Meanwhile the trial of the industrial dispute will be stayed.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: No order on the application for impleading party. All the CMPs are disposed of accordingly.\" Another interim order was passed on 29.8.1988 in Writ Petition NO.9334 of 1985 in the following terms :\n",
      "Paragraph 46: \"In the result, the 3rd respondent is directed to give employment directly to all the 407 workers and pay the wages directly to them as per the order of the Supreme Court dated 4.12.1988. This petition is ordered accordingly.\" On an appeal preferred by the Society before a Division Bench marked as W.A. No.1261 of 1988, it was directed :\n",
      "Paragraph 47: \"To give quietus to the controversy in the writ petition, we direct that W.P.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 9334/85 along with the connected writ petition viz. W.P. No.9333/85 be listed for final hearing on 26.10.1988 at the top of the list before the learned Single Judge, who hears the date-fixed writ petitions.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 49: All the three writ petitions came up for hearing before a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court. The said writ petitions were dismissed observing :\n",
      "Paragraph 50: \"The writ petitions are liable to be dismissed. However, having regard to the fact that the petitioner has made an application to the State Government as early as on 9.8.1985 as seen from paragraph 13 of the affidavit to prohibit the employment of contract labour under section 10 of the Act for loading, unloading and other activities of the 3rd respondent society, a reference to the counter affidavit filed by the government is necessary.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: Paragraphs 12 and 13 of the counter affidavit are extracted :\n",
      "Paragraph 52: \"It submit that the averments in paragraph 13 are not correct. The Union has applied to the State Advisory Contract Labour Board to issue directions to the Management prohibiting the employment of contract labour under Sec.10 of the Act. I submit that after consultation with State Advisory Contract Labour Board the Government will take a decision in this matter.\" This counter affidavit has been sworn to on 5th December, 1986. Even though there was no order pending these W.Ps.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: Prohibiting the Government from passing orders under Sec. 10 of the Act, the Government has not taken any action in spite of the averments contained in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the counter affidavits. It is for the Government to pass orders under Sec. 10 of the Act as expeditiously as possible, one way or other.\" Three letters patent appeals were preferred by the appellant herein being aggrieved by and dissatisfied therewith. By reason of the impugned judgment the said appeals were dismissed.\n",

      "Paragraph 56: Civil Appeal No.1353 of 2001 is the main appeal which arises out of an award of the Industrial Tribunal.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: SUBMISSIONS:\n",
      "Paragraph 58: Mr. N.G.R. Prasad, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would take us through the evidences adduced by the parties both oral and documentary as also the findings of the Industrial Tribunal and would submit that it and consequently the High Court committed a manifest error:\n",
      "Paragraph 59: (i) in passing the impugned award insofar as they failed to apply the 'organisation test' in the light of the decisions of this court;\n",
      "Paragraph 60: (ii) despite having arrived at the conclusion that the respondents society exercises supervision and control over the concerned workmen, in concluding that such supervision and control were not on its own behalf but on behalf of its members;\n",
      "Paragraph 61: (iii) in arriving at the finding that as the society does not carry out any manufacturing activities;\n",
      "Paragraph 62: it is not industry, inasmuch as supply of the services by an organisation would also give rise to formation of relationship of an employer and employees.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: Elaborating his submissions, Mr. Prasad would contend that it is not in dispute that the 407 workmen had been working in the market yard on a daily wage basis and although they are said to have been employed by the third parties but indisputably, the society pays wages to them although the same is said to be reimbursed by the members of the society. It was pointed out that the dispute between the members and members are resolved by the society and furthermore as the concerned persons have been given token and are given gifts during festival season, would lead to an irresistible inference that the concerned workmen are employees of the society.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: Mr. Prasad would argue that the principal question which was required to be asked was for whom do the workmen work and to whom they look up for their wages. It was submitted that the relationship between the Society and the workmen was required to be determined having regard to the following fact:\n",
      "Paragraph 65: (i) work is being carried out in the premises belonging to the society;\n",
      "Paragraph 66: (ii) wages are paid by the society;\n",
      "Paragraph 67: (iii) from Ex. W7 and W8, it would appear, that the society exercises control over the workmen;\n",
      "Paragraph 68: (iv) on festival occasions, the workmen look to the society for gift.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: It was contended that the Tribunal and the High Court overlooked the evidences on record as regard nature of the job performed by the workmen as has been admitted by MW1 and furthermore no finding has been arrived at to the effect that the so-called third parties are contractors.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: The learned counsel would submit that the Tribunal has committed a manifest error also in holding that only because the society takes commission from its members, it cannot be an employer. It was contended that for determining the question as regard existence of the relationship of employer and employee what is required to be considered is as to whether the concerned workmen are part and parcel of the organisation. Economic reality, the learned counsel would contend, has also some role to play.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: The learned counsel would urge that this Court in a large number of cases lifted the veil so as to come to the conclusion that the engagement of third parties or contractors may be a camouflage and there existed a relationship of employer and employee. Determination of such relationship, Mr. Prasad would aruge, do not depend upon the statutory liability of the employer as even in relation to non-statutory canteens this Court has held that the so-called workmen of the contractors are in effect and substance the workmen of the principal employer.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: Mr. Sudarsh Menon, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent society, on the other hand, would submit that the society is a service society and having regard to the fact that the members are both growers and merchants and as the porters and the graders are appointed by both growers and merchants independently, it cannot be said that the society is the employer of the concerned workmen. The learned counsel would contend that the Industrial Tribunal, the learned Single Judge as also the Division Bench of the High Court having arrived at a finding of fact that there does not exist any relationship of employer and employee, this Court should not interfere therewith.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: DETERMINATION OF RELATIONSHIP:\n",
      "Paragraph 74: Determination of the vexed questions as to whether a contract is a contract of service or contract for service and whether the concerned employees are employees of the contractors has never been an easy task. No decision of this Court has laid down any hard and fast rule nor it is possible to do so. The question in each case has to be answered having regard to the fact involved therein. No single test - be it control test, be it organisation or any other test - has been held to be the determinative factor for determining the jural relationship of employer and employee.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: There are cases arising on the borderline between what is clearly an employer- employee relation and what is clearly the independent entrepreneurial dealing.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: TESTS:\n",
      "Paragraph 77: [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] observed that supervision and control test is the prima facie test for determining the relationship of employment. The nature or extent of control required to establish such relationship would vary from business to business and, thus, cannot be given a precise definition. The nature of business for the said purpose is also a relevant factor. Instances are galore there where having regard to conflict in decisions in relation to the similar set of facts, the Parliament has to intervene as, for example, in the case of workers rolling bidis.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: In a given case it may not be possible to infer that a relationship of employer and employee has come into being only because some persons had been more or less continuously working in a particular premises inasmuch as even in relation thereto the actual nature of work done by them coupled with other circumstances would have a role to play.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: [?CITATION?], this Court said that it is a question of fact in each case whether the relationship of master and servant exists between the management and the workmen and there is no abstract a priori test of the work control required for establishing the control of service. A brief resume of the development of law in this point was necessary only for the purpose of showing that it would not be prudent to search for a formula in the nature of a single test for determining the vexed question.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: RELEVANT FACTORS:\n",
      "Paragraph 81: The control test and the organization test, therefore, are not the only factors which can be said to decisive.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: With a view of elicit the answer, the court is required to consider several factors which would have a bearing on the result : (a) who is appointing authority; (b) who is the pay master; (c) who can dismiss; (d) how long alternative service lasts; e) the extent of control and supervision; (f) the nature of the job, e.g. whether, it is professional or skilled work; (g) nature of establishment; (h) the right to reject.\n",
      "Paragraph 83: With a view to find out reasonable solution in a problematic case of this nature, what is needed is an integrated approach meaning thereby integration of the relevant tests wherefor it may be necessary to examine as to whether the workman concerned was fully integrated into the employer's concern meaning thereby independent of the concern although attached therewith to some extent.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: I.T. Smith and J.C. Wood in 'Industrial Law', third edition, at page 8-10 stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 85: \"In spite of the obvious importance of the distinction between an employee and an independent contractor, the tests to be applied are vague and may, in a borderline case, be difficult to apply.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: Historically, the solution lay in applying the 'control' test, i.e., could the employer control not just what the person was to do, but also the manner of this doing it - if so, that person was his employee. In the context in which it mainly arose in the nineteenth century, of domestic, agricultural and manual workers, this test had much to commend it, but with the increase sophistication of industrial processes and the greater numbers of professional and skilled people being in salaried employment, it soon became obvious that the test was insufficient (for example in the case of a doctor, architect, skilled engineer, pilot, etc.) and so, despite certain attempts to modernise it, it is now accepted that in itself control is no longer the sole test, though it does remain a factor and perhaps, in some cases, a decisive one.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: In the search for a substitute test, ideas have been put forward of an 'integration' test, i.e. whether the person was fully integrated into the employer's concern, or remained apart from and independent of it. Once again, this is not now viewed as a sufficient test in itself, but rather as a potential factor (which may be useful in allowing a court to take a wider and more realistic view). The modern approach has been to abandon the search for a single test, and instead to take a multiple or 'pragmatic' approach, weighing upon all the factors for and against a contract of employment and determining on which side the scales eventually settle. Factors which are usually of importance are as follows - the power to select and dismiss, the direct payment of some form of remuneration, deduction of PAYE and national insurance contributions, the organisation of the workplace, the supply of tools and materials (though there can still be a labour-only sub- contract) and the economic realities (in particular who bears the risk of loss and has the chance of profit and whether the employee could be said to be 'in business on his own account'). A further development in the recent case law (particularly concerning atypical employments) has been the idea of 'mutuality of obligations' as a possible factor, i.e. whether the course of dealings between the parties demonstrates sufficient such mutuality for there to be an overall employment relationship.\" [?CITATION?]. [?CITATION?], Lord Porter pointed out:\n",
      "Paragraph 88: \"Many factors have a bearing on the result. Who is paymaster, who can dismiss, how long the alternative service lasts, what machinery is employed, have all to be kept in mind.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: The expressions used in any individual case must always be considered in regard to the subject-matter under discussion but amongst the many tests suggested I think that the most satisfactory, by which to ascertain who is the employer at any particular time is to ask who is entitled to tell the employee the way in which he is to do the work upon which he is engaged.\" If the provisions of the contract as a whole are inconsistent with its being a contract of service, it will be some other kind of contract and the person doing the work will not be a servant. (See Ready Mixed Concrete [?CITATION?]) The decisions of this Court lead to one conclusion that law in this behalf is not static. In [?CITATION?], Krishna Iyer, J. observed \"to crystalise criteria conclusively is baffling but broad indications may be available from decisions\".\n",
      "Paragraph 90: The case at hand, as noticed hereinbefore, poses intricate question having regard to the facts and circumstance of the case.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: In our endevour to find out an answer, let us at the first instance look at the object of the Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: SOCIETY:\n",
      "Paragraph 93: The Society had a humble beginning but it had a laudable object, as would appear from its bye-laws. The objects of the Society are stated as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 94: \"a) To encourage self help, thrift and cooperation among members;\n",
      "Paragraph 95: b) To purchase seeds, manure, implements and other agricultural requirements for sale or distribution to members or members of the affiliated cooperative societies or to other cooperative societies;\n",

      "Paragraph 99: f) To act as agents for the joint purchase of the domestic and other requirements of its members and members of affiliated cooperative societies;\n",
      "Paragraph 100: g) To act as agent of those members which are affiliated societies in the matter of disbursing and receiving loans sanctioned to individual members of such societies;\n",
      "Paragraph 101: h) To act as the agent of those members which are affiliated societies in the matter of receiving for safe custody in its godowns or elsewhere the produce pledged to such societies by their individual members;\n",
      "Paragraph 102: i) To propagate and supply pure seeds;\n",
      "Paragraph 103: j) To own and hire lorries whenever necessary for the use of the members, members of affiliated cooperative societies and other public for hire, for the transport of manure, potatoes, other vegetables, fruits, implements etc.;\n",
      "Paragraph 104: k) To disseminate among the members and members of the affiliated cooperative societies a knowledge of the latest improvement in agriculture by arranging actual demonstration carried out by each individual member in his own land according to the advice of the agricultural department;\n",
      "Paragraph 105: l) To process raw material belonging to the members and members of affiliated cooperative societies or purchased by the society; and m) To arrange for packing and grading of agricultural produce of the members and members of the affiliated cooperative societies.\n",
      "Paragraph 106: n) Economically weak and small farmers having no holding power, thus, subjected to exploitation of the trading community are the beneficiaries.\n",
      "Paragraph 107: o) Clause 34 of the bye-laws states :\n",
      "Paragraph 108: \"That the Board of Directors may arrange for the sale of produce of members and members of affiliated cooperative societies pledged to or deposited with the society and disburse sale proceeds to them immediately after such lots are sold. In arranging for the sale they shall act only as the agent of the members and members of affiliated cooperative societies concerned and shall not do the business as owner on behalf of the society. Any loss arising out of the business shall be borne by the members of the affiliated cooperative societies concerned and not by the society.\" It is not in dispute that the Society is not a trading society. It cannot buy or sell the agricultural produce or the fruits except in a case where the proviso appended to bye-law 34 is attracted which is in the following terms :\n",
      "Paragraph 109: \"When the society enters into a contract with the Government of Military Department of cooperative institutes or with any firm which has entered into a contract with the Government or military department for supply of produce, the Board may purchase the produce outright whenever necessary and sell it as owner on behalf of the society.\" BURDEN OF PROOF:\n",
      "Paragraph 110: It is a well-settled principle of law that the person who sets up a plea of existence of relationship of employer and employee, the burden would be upon him.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: [?CITATION?], the Kerala High Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 112: \"The burden of proof being on the workmen to establish the employer- employee relationship an adverse inference cannot be drawn against the employer that if he were to produce books of accounts they would have proved employer-employee relationship.\" [?CITATION?] it has been held:\n",
      "Paragraph 113: \"Where a person asserts that he was a workmen of the Company, and it is denied by the Company, it is for him to prove the fact. It is not for the Company to prove that he was not an employee of the Company but of some other person.\" The question whether the relationship between the parties is one of the employer and employee is a pure question of fact and ordinarily the High Court while exercising its power of judicial review shall not interfere therewith unless the finding is manifestly or obviously erroneous or perverse.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: APPLICATION OF LAW IN THE PRESENT CASE:\n",
      "Paragraph 115: Having regard to the materials on records, we may at the outset notice the findings of the Industrial Tribunal which are : (1) having regard to the object of the Society, there is no need to employ labourers far less giving continuous employment to them. Exs.W-7, W-8 and W-12 do not show that superintendence control in respect of grading, weighing etc. is absolute. The memo. dated 27.8.1982 appears to have been issued having regard to a complaint made by traders who participate in the auction to the effect that the staff are not showing proper care in grading, weighing and stacking the goods in the Society and they have to purchase the under-quality and under-weight vegetables resulting in continuous loss to them. It is in that situation a direction was issued. A further complain was made that the Society employs small boys in grading, weighing and stacking of goods. In that situation the Godown Assistants were directed to see that no person who is less than 18 years is engaged for unloading, grading and stacking of cabbage and the workmen should be classified into two groups, one for unloading and another for grading, weighing and stacking.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: The Tribunal in this behalf observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 117: \"...Incidentally it is also significant to note that the society has been formed to protect the interest of the members.\n",
      "Paragraph 118: The society cannot keep quiet by stating it is the contractors job and it has no responsibility. In my opinion nothing is wrong in issuing the circular Ex.W-8, only to pull up the irresponsible of the staff and other workers. Therefore it would not amount to that the Respondent- Society has exercised its powers on their own workers and therefore they are employees.\" Although in the said letter, the word 'workmen' of the Society had been used, in all probability, the said expression had been used loosely. The Office Order dated 22.8.1963 provides for the job assigned to their regular staff.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: The job of the Marketing Supervisor is as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 120: \"7. Marketing supervisor :\n",
      "Paragraph 121: He should attend to the speedy disposal of the potato stocks of the members to their best advantage. He *should see that all the stocks purchased by the Merchants are taken delivery of without delay. He should control the staff working in the potato godowns and see that no complaints are received from members and merchants etc., regarding purchase or sale of potatoes. He should supervise grading, weighing and packing of potatoes promptly and properly.\" The job of the Marketing Supervisor, therefore, do not show that complete control and supervision is upon the society. The Marketing Supervisor was allotted the job to see that the work is carried out smoothly so that neither the purchaser members nor the merchant members are put to any disadvantage.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: Having regard to the interest of the farmers as also the merchants, the Marketing Supervisor was asked to supervise grading, weighing and packing of potatoes promptly and properly.\n",
      "Paragraph 123: The purported decision of the Society to give certain benefits to the workmen too is not decisive as the same had become a conciliation proceeding. The said conciliation proceeding, as noticed hereinbefore, had to be initiated having regard to the consequence upon a strike notice given by the workmen which could be averted due to conciliatory efforts. It would appear from the same that the conciliation efforts were made by the concerned Conciliation Officer. However, despite conciliation, graders and porters went on strike on 19.10.1982 whereafter again a conciliation proceeding was held pursuant whereto or in furtherance whereof certain advises and suggestions had been given by the conciliation officer based on agreement between the parties.\n",
      "Paragraph 124: The finding of the Tribunal in respect of Ex.W-12 is in the following terms :\n",
      "Paragraph 125: \"...Even under Ex.W-12 it has been stated to pay the festival advance to the graders through the representatives.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: Therefore it cannot be said they have been asked to pay directly the festival advance amount. That apart, it is relevant to note at this stage that this document has not been signed by any party. Considering these above facts and mianly taking into account the object of the society coupled with the duties envisaged under Clause 34 under Ex.M-22 bye-laws, it is impossible to come to a conclusion that the society has exercised these powers under Ex.W-7, Ex.W-8 and Ex.W-12 as an employer...\" The Tribunal has further come to the conclusion that token number had been given to the porters during emergency to save them from police harassment and no such token was issued after cessation of emergency.\n",
      "Paragraph 127: It is true, as contended by Mr. Prasad, that the Tribunal sought to distinguish certain cases relied upon by the learned counsel for the parties holding that in those cases, the employers were manufacturing units and were doing regular work but the observation of the Tribunal must be understood having regard to the totality of the circumstances as it has observed that in such cases employers being manufacturing units and were doing regular work and the nature of business was such which required continuous supervision and furthermore the workmen who were required to work on fixed hours which was not the case in the present one.\n",
      "Paragraph 128: The learned Tribunal has further found that the volume of job as also the number of persons working depend upon the season inasmuch in the peak season a large number of persons would be appointed whereas in the off season the number of appointments would be less. The Tribunal had further held that the Society acts as a commission agent. The submission of Mr. Prasad to the effect that the Tribunal has ignored the question of employment of contractor, some of whom may be under a legal incapacity to do so but the same again would not be decisive. Furthermore, even in terms of Section 21 of the [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act], the principal employer has a statutory obligation to see that the concerned employees are paid their wages and deduct the same from the bills of the contractors. It has also come on records that the remuneration paid by the Society on behalf of its members are done through Maistry and not directly to the concerned workers. We have noticed hereinbefore in details the nature of the services rendered by the Society to the different categories of its members, as also the right of the members to approach the third parties to take the services of the workmen working under them for unloading, grading and loading.\n",
      "Paragraph 129: In nutshell, the following can be deduced :\n",
      "Paragraph 130: 1\\. Growers and merchants are free to engage their own porters and graders or can do the work by themselves. There is, thus, no obligation on the societies godown or engage service of the workers, waiting in the yard.\n",
      "Paragraph 131: 2\\. No attendance registers or wage registers are maintained in respect of graders and porters.\n",
      "Paragraph 132: 3\\. The society has no control as who should do the work and the members are free to engage any worker available in the yard.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: 4\\. No working hours are fixed for porters and graders. They are free to come and go at will.\n",
      "Paragraph 134: 5\\. The workmen have no obligation to report to work everyday.\n",
      "Paragraph 135: 6\\. Society has no control regarding the number of workers to be engaged and the work to be turned out by the porters and graders.\n",
      "Paragraph 136: 7\\. No appointment order is issued by the society.\n",
      "Paragraph 137: 8\\. No disciplinary control over the porters and graders is exercised by the Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 138: 9\\. Total supervision or control is not exercised by the Society over the work done by porters or graders.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: 10\\. Porters and graders can go for other work and there is no obligation to work only in the yards.\n",
      "Paragraph 140: 11\\. Payment is normally made to a worker by the member. No direct payment is made to workers by the society. The society makes payment only on the authorization on behalf of that member.\n",
      "Paragraph 141: 12\\. Under the price guarantee scheme introduced by the society if the prices offered by the merchants are not acceptable to the members then the society guarantees the minimum price. If the produce sold by the society fetches more than the minimum guaranteed price excess is passed on to the member, if the price is less than the minimum price, the loss therefor is borne by the society.\n",
      "Paragraph 142: 13\\. Porters and graders also work under the supervision of members and merchants.\n",
      "Paragraph 143: Amounts paid by the society to a worker/authorized by a member is distributed by him to other workmen and the Society is not concerned with the number of workers engaged and amounts distributed to them.\n",
      "Paragraph 144: The farmers themselves are indigent persons. It is not a case where the concerned workmen are without any master.\n",
      "Paragraph 145: The third parties employ and pay them their salary or wages invariably. They have the right to appoint or not to appoint and the little amount of supervision made by the officers of the Society are for the purpose of overseeing the smooth transactions and not for its own benefit. The contract is entered into by different parties for different purposes. The services of the workmen by the farmers or traders may or may not be taken. There may be disputes between one class of members with the other which incidentally may have some bearing on the performance of job by the concerned workmen.\n",
      "Paragraph 146: We may further notice that the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents has drawn our attention to the statements made in the counter affidavit to the effect that the President of Petitioner Association runs the biggest private mundy in Mettupalayam and adopts the same procedure of engaging workers and the job of unloading, cleaning, sorting, grading etc. is done by the Respondent society. It has further been stated that there are about 60 such private mundies at Mettupalayam and although every mundy adopts the same pattern of engaging workers but except in the case of the respondent no industrial dispute had been raised in respect of any other mundy.\n",
      "Paragraph 147: EMPLOYMENT AND NON-EMPLOYMENT :\n",
      "Paragraph 148: Employment and non-employment indisputably is a matter which is specified in the Second and the Third Schedules of the [Industrial Disputes Act]. The concept of employment involves three ingredients, which are : (i) Employer - one who employs, i.e. engages the services of other persons;\n",
      "Paragraph 149: (ii) Employee - one who works for another for hire; and (iii) Contract of employment - the contract of service between the employer and the employee whereunder the employee agrees to serve the employer subject to his control and supervision. On the other hand, non-employment being negative of the expression \"employment\" would ordinarily mean a dispute when the workmen is out of service. When non-employment is referable to an employment which at one point of time was existing would be a matter required to be dealt with differently than a situation where non-employment would mean a contemplated employment.\n",
      "Paragraph 150: The question of non-employment in the later category would arise only when the employer refuses to give work to a person who pleads and proves to the satisfaction of the management that he was entitled thereto. However, the dispute regarding the refusal to employ the persons who were promised to be employed is not connected with the employment or non-employment within the meaning of Section 2(k) of the Act. (See [?CITATION?]) The reference made by the State of Tamil Nadu was absolutely vague. The very fact that reference suggests that the workmen are not being employed by the Society is itself a pointer to the fact that it is not the case where the State Government has proceeded on the basis that there existed such a relationship. Save and except in certain situations, as for example when there exists a provision in the standing order certified under [Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946] or a memorandum of settlement require the employer to employ certain persons, directions ordinarily cannot be issued by the Tribunal directing the employer to give employment.\n",
      "Paragraph 151: CAMOUFLAGE:\n",
      "Paragraph 152: Whether a contract is a sham or camouflage is not a question of law which can be arrived at having regard to the provisions of [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970]. It is for the industrial adjudicator to decide the said question keeping in view the evidences brought on records.\n",
      "Paragraph 153: [?CITATION?], non- maintenance of records by the contractors was held to be not conclusive for determination as to whether the workmen were working under the contractor. The Court held that such disputed questions of fact cannot be gone into in a civil proceeding.\n",
      "Paragraph 154: In [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 155: \"...A jurisdictional fact is one on the existence or otherwise of which depends assumption or refusal to assume jurisdiction by a court, tribunal or the authority. Said fact has to be established and its existence proved before a Court under the Maharashtra Act can assume jurisdiction of a particular case. If the complaint is made prima facie accepting existence of the contractor in such a case what has to be first established is whether the arrangement or agreement between the complainant and the contractor is sham or bogus. There is an inherence admission in such a situation that patently the arrangement is between the complainant and the contractor and the claim for a new and different relationship itself is a disputed fact.\n",
      "Paragraph 156: To put it differently, the complainant seeks for a declaration that such arrangement is not a real one but something which is a fagade. There is no direct agreement between the complainant and the principal employer and one such is sought to be claimed but not substantiated in accordance with law. The relief in a sense relates to a legal assumption that the hidden agreement or arrangement has to be surfaced...\" It was also observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 157: \"The common thread passing through all these judgments is that the threshold question to be decided is whether the industrial dispute could be raised for abolition of the contractor labour system in view of the provisions of the Maharashtra Act. What happens to an employee engaged by the contractor if the contract made is abolished is not really involved in the dispute. There can be no quarrel with the proposition as contended by the appellants that the jurisdiction to decide a matter would essentially depend upon pleadings in the plaint. But in a case like the present one, where the fundamental fact decides the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint itself the position would be slightly different. In order to entertain a complaint under the Maharashtra Act, it has to be established that the claimant was an employee of the employer against whom complaint is made, under the ID Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 158: When there is no dispute about such relationship, as noted in paragraph 9 of CIPLA's case (supra) the Maharashtra Act would have full application. When that basic claim is disputed obviously the issue has to be adjudicated by the forum which is competent to adjudicate...\" CASE LAWS :\n",
      "Paragraph 159: In the aforementioned backdrop, let us take note of certain decisions operating in the field vis-`-vis the factual matrix obtaining therein.\n",
      "Paragraph 160: [?CITATION?] is a case which involved workers who used to take leaves home for cutting them in proper shape. However, the actual rolling by filling the leaves with tobacco took place in places what were called contractors' factories. The bidis so rolled would be delivered to the appellant and nobody-else.\n",
      "Paragraph 161: The price of the raw-material as also the finished product would remain the same as fixed by the appellant therein.\n",
      "Paragraph 162: This Court having regard to the materials on records arrived at a finding of fact that the intermediaries were mere agents or branch managers appointed by the management and the relationship of employer and employee subsisted between the appellant and the bidis rollers, inter alia, on the ground that the so- called independent contractors served no particular duties and discharged no special functions and had no independence at all. They were impecunious persons who could hardly afford to have any factory of their own and in fact some of them were ex-employees of the appellant.\n",
      "Paragraph 163: In [?CITATION?], the job required to be performed was skilled and professional in nature. Mathew, J. speaking for the Bench observed that the test of right to control the manner of doing the work as traditionally formulated cannot be treated as an exclusive test. The court applied organization test in the fact situation obtaining therein laying importance on the fact that the employer provides the equipment and stating that where a person hires out a piece of work to an independent contractor, he expects the contractor to provided all the necessary tools and equipments, whereas if he employs a servant he expects to provide the same himself.\n",
      "Paragraph 164: The supply of machine was highlighted having regard to that fact that the sewing machine on which the workers do the work generally belong to the employer is an important consideration for deciding the relationship of master and servant. Besides the same the right of the employer to reject the end product and directing the worker to restitch it also led this court to conclude that the element of control and supervision was also present.\n",
      "Paragraph 165: However, in a slightly different fact situation where a person working as a part-time accountant for a long number of years who used to look after his own partnership business after working hours, was held to be not a workman. (See (Ker.)) In [?CITATION?], payments used to be made to the workmen on piece- rates in a big tailoring establishment. Desai, J. in the facts and circumstances of the case observed that right of removal of the workmen or not to give the work had the element of control and supervision which had been amply satisfied in that case.\n",
      "Paragraph 166: The question which arose for consideration was as to whether only because the concerned workman was paid on piece rate was itself indicative of the fact that there existed a relationship of principal employer and independent contractor.\n",
      "Paragraph 167: It is, however, relevant to note that therein also an observation was made to the effect that the method of payment in various occupations is different in different industries.\n",
      "Paragraph 168: In [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 169: \"The standards and nature of tests to be applied for finding out the existence of master and servant relationship cannot be confined to or concretized into fixed formula(e) for universal application, invariably in all class or category of cases. Though some common standards can be devised, the mere availability of any one or more or their absence in a given case cannot by itself be held to be decisive of the whole issue, since it may depend upon each case to case and the peculiar device adopted by the employer to get his needs fulfilled without rendering him liable.\n",
      "Paragraph 170: That being the position, in order to safeguard the welfare of the workmen, the veil may have to be pierced to get at the realities. Therefore, it would be not only impossible but also not desirable to lay down abstract principles or rules to serve as a ready reckoner for all situations and thereby attempt to compartmentalize and peg them into any pigeonhole formulae, to be insisted upon as proof of such relationship. This would only help to perpetuate practicing unfair labour practices than rendering substantial justice to the class of persons who are invariably exploited on account of their inability to dictate terms relating to conditions of their service. Neither all the tests nor guidelines indicated as having been followed in the decisions noticed above should be invariably insisted upon in every case, nor the mere absence of any one of such criteria could be held to be decisive of the matter. A cumulative consideration of a few or more of them, by themselves or in combination with any other relevant aspects, may also serve to be a safe and effective method to ultimately decide this often agitated question. Expecting similarity or identity of facts in all such variety or class of cases involving different type of establishments and in dealing with different employers would mean seeking for things, which are only impossible to find.\" Having regard to the fact that therein a cooperative canteen was promoted with the consent of the management by serving members of the Bank staff, which was running within the bank's premises and with the funds, subsidy and infrastructural facilities provided exclusively by the Bank, it was held that there existed a relationship of master and servant.\n",
      "Paragraph 171: However, we may notice that almost in a similar situation in Employers in relation to the [?CITATION?], it was held that in the absence of statutory or other legal obligations and in the absence of any right in the Bank to supervise and control the work or details there in any manner regarding the canteen workers employed in the three types of canteens, it cannot be said that relationship of master and servant existed between the Bank and the various persons employed in the three types of canteens and in that situation, the demand for regularization was considered to be unsustainable.\n",
      "Paragraph 172: In our opinion, the statutory canteen or other canteen run by the employer in his premises stands absolutely on a different footing. In determining the relationship of employer and employee, as has been noticed by this Court in [?CITATION?], the said question has no relevance.\n",
      "Paragraph 173: In [?CITATION?], as the appellants were required by the Factories Act to provide canteen facilities and since the workers engaged through the contractors had been held to be the employees of the principal employers, this Court held that the workers engaged through contractors were entitled for regularization of their services.\n",
      "Paragraph 174: Although we have reservation about the correctness or otherwise of the said decision but we need not go into the said question inasmuch even therein, the court noticed that the decision in Steel Authority of India Ltd. (supra) stands on a different footing.\n",
      "Paragraph 175: In [?CITATION?], the question which arose for consideration was as to whether the deposit collectors who received commission is in reality a wage which would depend on the productivity. Such commission was paid for promoting the business of the bank. Having regard to the fact that the banks have control over the deposit collectors, they were considered to be their own workers.\n",
      "Paragraph 176: In Indian Banks Association (supra) the reference which was made for adjudication of the Industrial Tribunal was as follows :\n",
      "Paragraph 177: \"Whether the demands of the Commission Agents or as the case may be Deposit Collectors employed in the banks listed in the annexure that they are entitled to pay scales, allowances and other service conditions available to regular clerical employees of those banks is justified ? If not, to what relief are the workmen concerned entitled and from which date ?\" Having regard to the evidences both oral and documentary led by the parties, the Tribunal directed :\n",
      "Paragraph 178: \"All those Deposit Collectors and Agents who are below the age of 45 years on 3.10.1980 (the date of the first reference of this industrial dispute) shall be considered for regular absorption for the post of clerks and cashiers if they are matriculates and above including qualified graduates and postgraduates. They may be taken to banks services as regular employees if they pass the qualifying examinations conducted by the banks. Those who are absorbed shall be treated on a par with regular clerical employees of the Bank.\n",
      "Paragraph 179: Those who have qualified 8th class and below matriculation shall be considered for absorption as sub-staff by conducting qualifications examination.\n",
      "Paragraph 180: As regards the Deposit Collectors and Agents who are above 45 years of age on the date 3.10.1980 and also those who are unwilling to be absorbed in regular banks service shall be paid the full back wage of Rs.750.00 per month linked with a minimum deposit of Rs.7500.00 per month and they should be paid incentive remuneration at 2% for collection of over and above 7500.00 per month and they should also pay uniform conveyance of Rs.50 per month for deposit of less than Rs.10,000.00 and Rs.100.00 per month for deposits of more than Rs.10,000.00 up to or above Rs.30,000.00 per month they should be paid gratuity of 15 days' commission for each year of service rendered.\" Thus in that decision, a scheme was formulated.\n",
      "Paragraph 181: However, we may notice that in [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 182: \"...However, persons who are engaged on the basis of individual contracts to work on a commission basis cannot, by the very nature of their engagement, be equated with regular employees doing similar work...\" In [?CITATION?], the concerned workmen were engaged as gardeners to sweep, clean, maintain and look after the lawns and parks inside factory premises and campus of the residential colony of the appellant through the agencies of the Respondent Nos.3 to 5; therein their services were terminated pursuant whereto an industrial dispute was raised before the Tribunal, the employer did not produce any records. Having applied the control test and in view of the fact that the records of the concerned workmen had not been produced, this Court did not interfere with the award of the Tribunal and the judgment of the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 183: In [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 184: \"...The concept of employment involves three ingredients (1) employer (2) employee and (3) the contract of employment. The employer is one who employs, i.e. one who engages the services of other persons. The employee is one who works for another for hire.\n",
      "Paragraph 185: The employment is the contract of service between the employer and the employee whereunder the employee agrees to serve the employer subject to his control and supervision...\" Following the decision of this Court in Shri Chintaman Rao (supra), this Court in [?CITATION?], held:\n",
      "Paragraph 186: \"Employment brings in the contract of service between the employer and the employed. We have mentioned already that in this case there was no agreement or contract of service between the appellant and Pandurang. What can be said at the most is that whenever Pandurang went to work, the appellant agreed to supply him tobacco for rolling bidis and that Pandurang agreed to roll bidis on being paid at a certain rate for the bidis turned out. The appellant exercised no control and supervision over [?CITATION?], this Court upon noticing several authorities held :\n",
      "Paragraph 187: \"The principle which emerges from these authorities is that the prima facie test for the determination of the relationship between master and servant is the existence of the right in the master to supervise and control the work done by the servant not only in the matter of directing what work the servant is to do but also the manner in which he shall do his work, or to borrow the words of Lord Uthwatt at page 23 in [?CITATION?], \"The proper test is whether or not the hirer had authority to control the manner of execution of the act in question\".\n",
      "Paragraph 188: The nature or extent of control which is requisite to establish the relationship of employer and employee must necessarily vary from business to business and is by its very nature incapable of precise definition. As has been noted above, recent pronouncements of the Court of Appeal in England have even expressed the view that it is not necessary for holding that a person is an employee, that the employer should be proved to have exercised control over his work, that the test of control was not one of universal application and that there were many contracts in which the master could not control the manner in which the work was done (Vide observations of Somervell, L.J., in Cassidy v. Ministry of Health (supra), and Denning, L.J., in Stevenson, Jordan and Harrison Ltd. v. MacDonald and Evans (supra).) The correct method of approach, therefore, would be to consider whether having regard to the nature of the work there was due control and supervision by the employer or to use the words of Fletcher Moulton, L.J., at page 549 in[?CITATION?] :- \"In my opinion it is impossible to lay down any rule of law distinguishing the one from the other. It is a question of fact to be decided by all the circumstances of the case. The greater the amount of direct control exercised over the person rendering the services by the person contracting for them the stronger the grounds for holding it to be a contract of service, and similarly the greater the degree of independence of such control the greater the probability that the services rendered are of the nature of professional services and that the contract is not one of service.\" In [?CITATION?], this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 189: \"...It stands established that Industrial Law revolves on the axis of master and servant relationship and by a catena of precedents it stands established that the prima facie test of relationship of master and servant is the existence of the right in the master to supervise and control the work done by the servant (the measure of supervision and control apart) not only in the matter of directing what work the servant is to do but also the manner in which he shall do his work...\" However, we may note that in Workmen of the Canteen of Coates of India Ltd. vs. Coates of India Ltd. (Civil Appeal No.3479/1987 disposed of on 28.8.1996, this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 190: \"...some requirement under the Factories Act of providing a canteen in the industrial establishment, is by itself not decisive of the question or sufficient to determine the status of the persons employed in the canteen.\n",
      "Paragraph 191: The effect, if any, relating to compliance of the provisions of Factories Act is a different matter which does not arise for consideration in the present case.\" [See also [?CITATION?]].\n",
      "Paragraph 192: On the aforementioned backdrop of legal principles, We may now consider the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in Steel Authority of India Limited (supra). The principal question which arose for consideration therein was as to whether having regard to the provisions contained in Section 10 of the [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act], the workmen employed by the contractors in the event of abolition of contract labour were entitled to be automatically absorbed in the services of the principal employer. While answering the question in the negative the court reversed the earlier decision of this Court in [?CITATION?]. This Court referring to a large number of decisions and tracing the history of the [Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act], noticed that the Industrial Tribunal although prior to coming into force could issue directions for such regularization but such directions could not be issued after coming into force of the Act. In view of the Constitution Bench decision in[?CITATION?], the Court held that although the principle that a beneficial legislation needs to be construed liberally in favour of the class for whose favour it is intended, the same would not extend to reading in the provisions of the Act what the legislature has not provided whether expressly or by necessary implication, or substituting remedy or benefits for that provided by the legislature. Upon analyzing the case law, the categories of cases were sub-divided into three stating :\n",
      "Paragraph 193: \"An analysis of the cases, discussed above, shows that they fall in three classes : (i) where contract labour is engaged in or in connection with the work of an establishment and employment of contract labour is prohibited either because the industrial adjudicator/court ordered abolition of contract labour or because the appropriate Government issued notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, no automatic absorption of the contract labour working in the establishment was ordered; (ii) where the contract was found to be a sham and nominal, rather a camouflage, in which case the contract labour working in the establishment of the principal employer were held, in fact and in reality, the employees of the principal employer himself. Indeed, such cases do not relate to abolition of contract labour but present instances wherein the Court pierced the veil and declared the correct position as a fact at the stage after employment of contract labour stood prohibited; (iii) where in discharge of a statutory obligation of maintaining a canteen in an establishment the principal employer availed the services of a contractor the courts have held that the contract labour would indeed be the employees of the principal employer.\" The instant case although was sought to be put in category (ii) as referred to Steel Authority (supra) by Mr.\n",
      "Paragraph 194: Prasad, he, as noticed hereinbefore, took us also to the case law falling in Class (i) and Class (iii) aforementioned.\n",
      "Paragraph 195: There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that where a person is engaged through an intermediary or otherwise for getting a job done, a question may arise as the appointment of an intermediary was merely sham and nominal and rather than camouflage where a definite plea is raised in Industrial Tribunal or the Labour Court, as the case may be, and in that event, it would be entitled to pierce the veil and arrive at a finding that the justification relating to appointment of a contractor is sham or nominal and in effect and substance there exists a direct relationship of employer and employee between the principal employer and the workman.\n",
      "Paragraph 196: The decision of this Court in [?CITATION?] will fall in that category.\n",
      "Paragraph 197: ANALYSIS:\n",
      "Paragraph 198: Having regard to the aforementioned findings, we are of the opinion, the High Court has rightly affirmed the award of the Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal as also the High Court further rightly arrived at a finding to the effect that the concerned workmen were not able to discharge their burden of proof that they were employed by the Society.\n",
      "Paragraph 199: The decisions referred to hereinbefore are indicative of the fact that the different tests have been applied in different cases having regard to the nature of the problem arising in the fact situation obtaining therein. Emphasis on application of control test and organization test have been laid keeping in view the question as to whether the matter involves a contract of service vis-`-vis contract for service; or whether the employer had set up a contractor for the purpose of employment of workmen by way of a smoke screen with a view to avoid its statutory liability.\n",
      "Paragraph 200: In the present case we are faced with a peculiar situation. The society is a service society which has been formed with the object of protecting the growers from being exploited at the hands of the traders.\n",
      "Paragraph 201: It has been found that the employment of the workmen for doing a particular piece of work is at the instance of the producer or the merchants on an ad hoc basis or job to job basis and, thus, the same may not lead to the conclusion that relationship of employer and employee has come into being. Furthermore, when an employee has a right to work or not when an offer is made to him in this behalf by the producer or by the merchants will also assume significance.\n",
      "Paragraph 202: For the purpose of earning livelihood, a person has to involve himself into certain kinds of activities wherefor, he must subject himself to some sort of discipline or control, which is even otherwise implicit.\n",
      "Paragraph 203: The findings arrived at by the learned Tribunal as well as the High Court would clearly go to show that the concerned workmen are engaged both by the growers as also the traders. Only on some occasions, payment is made to the concerned workmen through the third parties only in a case where the grower is not immediately in a position to pay the same as he was yet to receive the price of the vegetables to be auctioned. We must bear in mind that the Society deals with small and marginal farmers who themselves look after the Society for obtaining such assistance as may be necessary from not being exploited by the traders and had been facing the problem of a forced sale of their produce at the throw away price. The totality of the circumstances as opined by the Tribunal and affirmed by the High Court would clearly go to show that although certain activities are carried out in the market yards wherefor requisite infrastructures are provided, the Society in general does not have the necessity of employing any workman either for the purpose of loading, unloading or grading. Ultimately, the remuneration to the concerned workmen are borne either by the farmers or by the merchants. Presumably the amount paid to the loaders, unloaders and the graders would vary, as for example whereas there would be cases where the growers themselves would unload their merchandise either from trucks or carts. In case growers take the assistance of the concerned persons for unloading after the auction is held the payment would be made by the traders. In a situation of this nature and particularly having regard to the fact that the respondent is a cooperative society which only renders services to its own members and despite the fact that in relation thereto it receives commission at the rate of one per cent both from the farmers as also the traders; it does not involve in any trading activity.\n",
      "Paragraph 204: Although rendition of such service may amount to carrying out an industrial activity within the meaning of the provisions of the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] but we are in this case not concerned with the said question. What we are concerned with is as to whether the concerned workmen have been able to prove that they are workmen of the Society. They have not.\n",
      "Paragraph 205: CONCLUSION :\n",
      "Paragraph 206: In view of what has been found hereinbefore, we are of the opinion that the decision of the Tribunal as affirmed by the High Court cannot be said to be perverse warranting our interference.\n",
      "Paragraph 207: For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in these appeals which are dismissed accordingly. No costs.\n",
      "Paragraph 208: However, before parting with the matter, we may observe that we have no doubt in our mind keeping in view the assurances given to the High Court by the Society, as recorded in its order dated 12.12.2000, the Respondent will continue to see that the concerned employees are provided with employment.\n",

      "Paragraph 2: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 6546-6552 OF 2003 PRADEEP OIL CORPORATION ....Appellant Versus MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF DELHI AND ANR ....Respondents\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Dr. Mukundakam Sharma, J.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: 1\\. Whether an agreement for erection of oil storage tank together with pump house, chowkidar cabins, switch room, residential rooms and verandah for storing oil decanted from the railway tankers, which bring petroleum products to the site at which they are decanted, would amount to lease or license, is one of the several questions which falls for consideration in these appeals, which has arisen out of a Full 1 Bench decision rendered by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi while disposing a batch of petitions bearing Nos. LPA 53, 54, 55, 57 and 58/1987.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 2\\. Before dwelling into the question of law involved hereinabove and in order to appreciate the contentions raised by the parties hereto, we may notice few basic fact which has resulted into filing of these appeals.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 3\\. The appellant herein had been granted under the Government Grant Act separate and distinct licenses by the President of India acting through Superintendent of Northern Railway, Delhi for the purpose of maintaining depot for storage of petroleum products at a yearly license fee of Rs. 20,640/- and Rs. 31,000/- per annum respectively.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 4\\. Under the aforesaid grant, the appellant had been given the right to erect/construct `petroleum installation buildings' consisting of petroleum tanks, buildings and other conveniences for receiving and storing therein petroleum in bulk, and consequently possession of land has been given.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 2\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 5\\. Consequent to the said agreement the administration granted `exclusive possession' of the said land to the appellant who entered the land for the purpose and the terms mentioned therein in the aforesaid agreement/grant. Consequently, the appellant submitted layout building plans for the construction of the oil depot and the standing committee of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (in short \"MCD\") approved the layout plan for the construction of 10 oil storage tanks of petroleum products.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: 6\\. Subsequent to that the appellant raised various constructions comprising of an administration block etc. along with huge petroleum storage tanks for storing petroleum products. A boundary wall around the installations and the administrative block was also constructed. The nature of the construction which is stated to be wide range and extensive user, is more than 40 years old now.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 7\\. The respondent MCD vide its Order dated 17.08.1984 passed an assessment order with regard to the property tax qua the aforesaid property and confirmed the rateable value 3 proposed by it. The said assessment order was challenged by the appellant before the appellate Court/MCD Tribunal which vide its Order dated 12.7.1985 set aside the assessment order passed by the respondent MCD and held that the appellant is only a licensee in the property and is not a tenant, therefore, no property tax can be levied on the appellant under Section 20(2) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (in short \"MCD Act\"). Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the appellate Court, the respondent MCD filed a writ petition. However, the said writ petition was dismissed by the Ld. Single Judge of the Delhi High Court on 05.08.1986 holding that the petroleum storage tanks do not fall within the definition of building under the MCD Act. It was further held by the Ld. Single Judge that the grant in favour of the petitioner was a license and hence the petitioner is not liable for the payment of any property tax in respect of the land or the petroleum storage tanks. Challenging the aforesaid order of Ld. Single Judge, an LPA was filed and subsequently, the same was referred to a Full Bench of High Court. The Full Bench of the High Court vide its impugned judgment and order dated 17.09.2002 held 4 that the petroleum storage tanks are a building and the petitioner was a lessee and not a licensee in the property in question.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 8\\. It was forcefully argued before us by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant that no property tax is payable qua the property in question under the provisions of section 119 of the DMC Act read with Article 285 of the Constitution of India, as the property in question is a government property. It was further contended that the incidence to pay property tax qua the petroleum installations including the tanks cannot fall upon the appellant under section 120(2) of the DMC Act because the appellant is a mere licencee of government land having permission to construct and consequently having constructed thereupon is neither a tenant nor a lessee and the agreement in question does not create any leasehold right or tenancy in the favour of the appellant. In other words, the submission was that the agreement in question is a licence deed. It was further contended that the petroleum storage tanks/depots are not \"buildings\" and therefore not subject to 5 property tax. It was also argued that the petroleum storage tanks/depots being plant and machinery are liable to be exempted under the provisions of section 116(3) of the DMC Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 9\\. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent MCD submitted that the indentures in question are indeed a lease and not a licence. It was argued that the question as to whether such an oil storage tank would be building or not is no longer res integra in view of judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of [?CITATION?] It has been further contended that that the question as to whether the indentures in question constitute lease or license so as to attract the provisions of Section 120 of the MCD Act would depend upon the construction thereof. It was urged that having regard to the nature of the interest conveyed, it would be erroneous to construe the instrument as a license as the land having been used for the purpose of construction of a building, the object thereof being clear, it could not have been 6 construed to be a license and must be construed to be a lease. It was further argued that it is not a case where it could be said that no interest in the land had been created by reason of the instruments in question.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 10\\. Before addressing the rival contentions, it would be useful to reiterate few relevant provisions of the MCD Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: \"2(3) \"building\" means a house, out-house, stable, latrine, urinal, shed, hut wall (other than a boundary wall) or any other structure, whether of masonry, bricks, wood, mud, metal or other material but does not include any portable shelter\".\n",
      "Paragraph 16: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"2(24). \"land\" includes benefits to arise out of land, things attached to the each or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth and rights created by law over any street:\n",
      "Paragraph 17: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"119\\. Taxation of Union properties.--(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this chapter, lands and buildings being properties of the union shall be exempt from the property taxes specified in Section 114:\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall prevent the Corporation from levying any of the said taxes on such lands and buildings to which 7 immediately before the 26th January, 1950 they were liable or treated as liable so long as that tax continues to be levied by the Corporation on other lands and buildings.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"120(2). If any land has been let for a term exceeding one year to a tenant and such tenant has built upon the land, the property taxes assessed in respect of that land and the building erected thereon shall be primarily livable upon the said tenant, whether the land and building are in the occupation of such tenant or a sub- tenant of such tenant.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"123\\. Property taxes a first charge on premises on which they are assessed.--Property taxes due under this Act in respect of any land or building shall, subject to the prior payment of the land revenue if any, due to the Government thereon be a first charge- (a) in the case of any land or building held immediately from the Government, upon the interest in such land or building of the person liable for such taxes and upon the goods and other movable properties if any found within or upon such land or building and belonging to such person; and (b) in the case of any other land or building upon such land or building and upon the goods and other movable properties/ if any, found within or upon such land or building and belonging to the person liable for such taxes.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 8\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 11\\. We may also notice the language of Article 285 of the Constitution of India which reads as follows: - \"285\\. Exemption of property of the Union from State taxation (1) The property of the Union shall, save insofar as Parliament may by law otherwise provide, be exempt from all taxes imposed by a State or by any authority within a State.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: (2) Nothing in clause (1) shall, until Parliament by law otherwise provides, prevent any authority within a State from levying any tax on any property of the Union to which such property was immediately before the commencement of this Constitution liable or treated as liable, so long as that tax continues to be levied in that State.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 12\\. It would be useful to examine at this stage the definition of \"lease\" and \"license\" as envisaged under Section 105 of the [Transfer of Property Act, 1882] and section 52 of the [Indian Easements Act, 1882] respectively.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: Section 105 of the [Transfer of Property Act, 1882] reads: - \"105\\. Lease Defined.--A lease of immovable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other thing of value, to be 9 rendered periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor by the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such terms.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 26: On the other hand, Section 52 of the [Indian Easements Act], 1882 reads as:\n",
      "Paragraph 27: \"License, defined.--Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful, and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called, a license.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 28: 13\\. A license may be created on deal or parole and it would be revocable. However, when it is accompanied with grant it becomes irrevocable. A mere license does not create interest in the property to which it relates. License may be personal or contractual. A licensee without the grant creates a right in the licensor to enter into a land and enjoy it. In Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edition, Vol. 27 at page 21 it is stated: - \"license coupled with grant of interest: A license coupled with a grant of an interest in property is not revocable. Such a license is capable of 10 assignment, and covenants may be made to run with it. A right to enter on land and enjoy a profit a prendre or other incorporeal hereditament is a license coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. Formerly it was necessary that the grant of the interest should be valid; thus, if the interest was an incorporeal hereditament, such as a right to make and use a watercourse, the grant was not valid unless tinder seal, and the license, unless so made, was therefore a mere license and was revocable but since 1873 the Court has been bound to give effect to equitable doctrines and it will restrain the revocation of a license coupled with a grant which should be, but is not, under seal.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 29: 14\\. Lease on the other hand, would amount to transfer of property. In [?CITATION?], the following well established proposition were laid down by a Constitution Bench for ascertaining whether a transaction amounts to a lease or a license: - \"27\\. There is a marked distinction between a lease and a license. Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act defines a lease of immovable property as a transfer of a right to enjoy such property made for a certain time in consideration for a price paid or promised. Under Section 108 of the said Act, the lessee is entitled to be put in possession of the property. A lease is thereforee a transfer of an interest in land. The interest 11 transferred is called the leasehold interest. The Lesser parts with his right to enjoy the property during the term of the lease, and it follows from it that the lessee gets that right to the exclusion of the Lesser. Whereas Section 52 of the Indian Easement Act defines a license.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: Under the aforesaid section, if a document gives only a right to use the property in a particular way or under certain terms while it remains in possession and control of the owner thereof, it will be a license. The legal possession, thereforee, continues to be with the owner of the property, but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for the permission his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favor any estate or interest in the property. There is, therefore, clear distinction between the two concepts. The dividing line is dear through sometimes it becomes very thin or even blurred. Alone time it was thought that the test of exclusive possession was infallible and if a person was given exclusive possession of a premises, it would conclusively establish that he was a lessee. But there was a change and the recent trend of judicial option is reflected in [?CITATION?], wherein Lord Denning reviewing the case law on the subject summarises the result of his discussion thus at p. 155:\n",
      "Paragraph 31: \"The result of all these cases is that, although a person who is let into exclusive possession is, prima facie to be considered to be tenant, nevertheless he will not be held to be so if the circumstances negative any intention to create a tenancy.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 12\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 15\\. It is quite clear that the distinction between lease and license is marked by the last clause of Section 52 of the Easement Act as by reason of a license, no estate or interest in the property is created. In the case of [?CITATION?] it was observed at p. 398 thus: - \"... If an interest in immovable property, entitling the transferors to enjoyment is created, it is a lease; if permission to use land without right to exclusive possession is alone granted, a license is the legal result.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 34: (emphasis underlined)\n",
      "Paragraph 35: 16\\. A license, inter alia, (a) is not assignable; (b) does not entitle the licensee to sue the stranger in his own name; (c) it is revocable and (d) it is determined when the grantor makes subsequent assignment. The rights and obligations of the lessor as contained in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 are also subject to the contract to the contrary. Even the right of assignment of leasehold property may be curtailed by an agreement.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 13\n",
      "Paragraph 37: 17\\. In the present case grant has been made by the President of India in terms of Section 2 of the Government Grants Act, 1895 and the [Transfer of Property Act, 1882] may have little bearing in the instant case. The former, i.e. the [Government Grants Act, 1895] being a special statute would prevail over the general statute, i.e. the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Accordingly, the rights and obligations of the parties would be governed by the terms of the provisions of [Government Grants Act, 1895] whereunder the Government is entitled to impose limitations and restrictions upon the grants and other transfer made by it or under its authority.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 18\\. In view of the aforesaid legal position with regard to the applicability of the [Government Grants Act], we have considered the grant in question after hearing both the parties at length and perused the entire record.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 19\\. A bare perusal of the grant in question reveals that in the grant, the appellant herein i.e. grantee has been described as licensee. But in our considered view the 14 mere use of the word \"licensee\" would not be sufficient to hold the grant in question as a license. Simply using the word \"licensee\" would neither be regarded as conclusive nor determinative. In terms of Clause (1) of the said indenture the licensee was to have the use of a piece of land for maintaining a depot for petroleum goods received through railways but thereby his rights to deal with the property and the goods brought thereon had not been taken away. Clearly, an embargo has been placed as regards the user of the construction made thereon to the extent that the same would be used solely for the storage of petroleum products but such restriction by itself can also be imposed in a case of lease. The grant in question clearly states that the constructions are to be made as per specifications approved by the Chief Inspector of Explosives which condition was also otherwise governed by the provisions of Explosives Act. Further, the pipelines are required to be laid at railway levels or demised in favor of the grantee, where for expenses are to be paid by it. It further sates that the pipelines are to be laid 15 underground in such a manner that vehicles can pass over that.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 20\\. The present appellant i.e. licensee is required to pay the sum specified therein which has been described as 'rent' in terms of Clause 7. It further reveals that the licensee is also required to pay all taxes payable in respect of the said land for the time being found to be payable and proportionately and all cesses, and taxes in respect of the premises applicable to the land, tanks, works and conveniences if the same be not separately assessed in respect thereof. It further stipulates that the licensee shall not be entitled to assign, mortgage, sub-let or otherwise transfer the privileges without previously obtaining the consent in writing of the Administration. The licensee shall not use the said land or any part thereof or permit the same to be used for worship, or religious or educational purposes or for any other purpose not specified in Clause 1 thereof but such a claim is not determinative. Clause (9) of the said 16 indenture stipulates that either party would be entitled to terminate the license without assigning any reasons by giving to the other party at any time three calendar months' notice in writing. It is to be noted that even under Section 106 of the [Transfer of Property Act, 1882] no reason is required to be assigned for determining the lease.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 21\\. Further, Clause 11 of the indenture in question provides that nothing contained herein be construed to create a tenancy in favor of the licensee of the said land but again in our considered view, the mere description of the grant in question is not decisive. Under the grant in question, the Administration has been given power under Clause 12 to re-enter upon and retake and absolutely retain the possession of the said land but the same could be permissible in law only upon determination of grant which would require 3 months' prior notice. It is to be noted that Clause 12 further stipulates that the licensee shall at all times keep the Administration indemnified 17 against and shall reimburse it towards all claims, demands, suits, losses, damages, costs etc. which it may sustain or incur by reason of inconsequence of any injury to any person or to any property resulting from any explosion or leakage of any petroleum kept or placed by the licensee upon the said land.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 22\\. Clause 14 of the indenture in question provides that the licensee shall follow all petroleum rules and regulations applicable to the construction, maintenance of petrol pump or stores and for public safety. It is significant to note that the aforesaid clause clearly provides that all taxes in respect of the said patrol pump, stores, buildings under the control of the licensee shall be paid by the licensee. However, the rights of the parties on determination of the grant have been specified.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 23\\. The aforesaid clauses of the indenture in question clearly shows that a bundle of rights have been conferred upon the grantee i.e. the appellant herein. 18\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 24\\. It is well settled legal position that a deed must be read in its entirety and reasonably. The intention of the parties must also as far as possible be gathered from the expression used in the document itself.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 25\\. In [?CITATION?], an instrument was held to be a deed of lease as the lessee was conferred right to exclusive possession where for various terms of the indenture which were taken into consideration for finding out whether the same was lease or a license. Similarly, In [?CITATION?], where the defendant was given exclusive possession of the disputed premises for running a hotel but was not given the permission to sub- lease the property, the document was held to be a license.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: \"9\\. .... this Court has indicated that for a consideration as to whether a document creates a license or lease, the substance of the document must be preferred to the form. It is not correct to say that exclusive possession of a party is irrelevant but at the same it is also not 19 conclusive. The other tests, namely, intention of the parties and whether the document creates any interest in the property or not are important considerations.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 47: 26\\. In [?CITATION?], a deal was held to be a license where the keys of the premises was to be taken in the morning and returned in the evening and a portion thereof was occupied by the mother of the licensor.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 27\\. In [?CITATION?] it was held: - \"3\\. On a careful consideration of the above arguments, we feel that there is no substance in any one of them. To our mind it is very clear that the right granted under the above document is nothing but a license. Our reasons are as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 49: (1) the nomenclature of the document is license. Of course, we hasten to add that nomenclature is not always conclusive;\n",
      "Paragraph 50: (2) the document in question in no unambiguous terms says that the possession and control shall remain with the owner. This is a clear indication of the fact that no interest in immovable property has been conferred on the grantee. If it were to be a case of lease under Section 105 of the [Transfer of Property Act], there must be an interest in the immovable property. On the 20 contrary, if it were to be a license under Section 52 of the Easements Act, no such interest in immovable property is created. The case on hand is one of such.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: (4) No doubt there is a statement in the document that \"I shall not sublet it to further anybody else. This is nothing more than an affirmation of the requirement that the licensee must use the property. No doubt under Section 52 of the Easements Act, license is personal but where an affirmation is made that such an affirmation cannot alter the relationship of the parties as Lesser and lessee. In this view factually the case [?CITATION?], Quoted from the judgment and order dated 3.5.1993 of Andhra Pradesh Admn. Tribunal at Hyderabad in OA No. 47322/91 and 5668/92, is distinguishable.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 52: 28\\. In [?CITATION?], an assignment made to the effect that the owner permitted the licensee to occupy a portion with no right or interest created in his favor and also undertaken to vacant the premises within one month, was held to be a case of license.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 29\\. In view of the aforesaid well settled legal position, whether a particular document will constitute \"lease\" or \"license\" 21 would inter alia depend upon certain factors which can be summarized as follows: - (a) whether a document creates a license or lease, the substance of the document must be preferred to the form;\n",
      "Paragraph 54: (b) the real test is the intention of the parties -- whether they intended to create a lease or a license;\n",
      "Paragraph 55: (c) if the document creates an interest in the property, it is a lease; but if it only permits another to make use of the property, of which the legal possession continues with the owner, it is a license; and (d) if under the document a party gets exclusive possession of the property, prima facie, he is considered to be a tenant; but circumstances may be established which negative the intention to create a lease.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 30\\. Reverting back to the factual situation of the case at hand, admittedly, the appellant is in possession of the buildings 22 in question since 1958. They have been permitted to raise huge constructions and the nature of construction is of wide range. An administration block along with tanks for storing petroleum had been constructed. A boundary wall around installations and administrative block had also been constructed. Admittedly, the grantee is in exclusive possession over the lands in question along with construction thereon without any let or hindrance from the Administration. Further, the appellant had been continuously carrying on their business without any interference from any quarter whatsoever since 1962. As in the instant case, exclusive possession has been granted, as discussed hereinbefore, there is a strong presumption in favour of tenancy. That being the case, it is for the appellant to show that despite the right to possess the demised premises exclusive; a right or interest in the property has not been created. The burden therefore would be on the appellant/grantee to prove contra.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: 23\n",
      "Paragraph 58: 31\\. The aforesaid burden is not discharged in the present case rather for the purposes resisting its eviction from the suit land in the proceeding initiated under the Public Premises Unauthorized Occupants Eviction Act, the appellant has taken the stand pleading non-applicability of the Indian Easement Act and has themselves termed the arrangement as a tenancy by describing the fee as rentals. The said factor is also a vital factor as on the own showing of the appellant the arrangement was nothing but a lease. The appellant therefore cannot take up a plea by which they approbate and reprobate at the same time.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 32\\. In [?CITATION?], it was held that when exclusive possession is granted in lieu of only rent payable therefore, the presumption that the instrument is that of a lease becomes stronger. In the present case the Administration has also option to revise the rent. Had it been a case of mere right to use the property, such provision would not have been there. Further, the manner in which the rent is to be paid is also 24 important. It is to be paid annually in a case of a license pure and simple, the indenture would not normally contain a claim that rent would be paid annually.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 33\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 61: \"However, this cannot answer the disputed issue as it creates a license or lease, the substance of the document must be referred to the form, As was observed by this Court in [?CITATION?] , the real test is the intention of the parties -- whether they intended to create a lease or license. If an interest in the property is created by the deed it is a lease but if the document only permits another person to make use of the property \"of which the legal possession continues with the owner\" it is a license. If the party in whose favor the document is executed gets exclusive possession of the property prima facie he must be considered to be a tenant: although this factor by itself will not be decisive. Judged in this light, there does not appear to be any scope for interpreting Ex. 20 as an agreement of leave and license.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 62: 34\\. It is true that there are indeed certain restrictions which have been imposed by the Administration with regard to the construction of the building storage tank, etc., but in our considered view such restrictions are not decisive for 25 the purpose of determining as to whether a document is a lease or license as such restrictions could also be imposed in case of a lease as well. In [?CITATION?], it was held:\n",
      "Paragraph 63: \"In the so-called license itself it is called indifferently a license and a demise, but in the Act it is spoken of as a lease, and the holder of it is described as the lessee. It is not, however, a question of words, but of substance. If the effect of the instrument is to give the holder an exclusive right of occupation of the land though subject to certain reservations or to a restriction of the purposes for which it may be used, it is in law a demise of the land itself.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 35\\. We may also notice the undisputed fact that in the present case the parties have agreed that for the purpose of determination of the agreement three calendar months' notice had to be given. Undoubtedly, such clause in the document in question has a significant role to play in the matter of construction of document. Clearly, if the parties to the agreement intended that by reason of such agreement merely a license would be created such a term could not have been inserted. 26\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 36\\. It is well settled legal position that a license can be revoked at any time at the pleasure of the licensor. Even otherwise, unless the parties to the agreement had an intention to enter into a deed of lease the Administration would not have agreed to demise the premises on payment of rent in lieu of grant of exclusive possession of the demised land and further stipulated service of three months' notice calling upon either party to terminate the agreement. In view of the same, the argument advanced by the learned counsel of the appellant that a stipulation having been made in the agreement itself that by reasons thereof the grantee shall not be a tenant and thus the deed must be construed to be a license cannot be accepted. In our considered view, such a clause may at best be one of the factors for construction of the document in question but the same by itself certainly be a decisive factor.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 37\\. The next question which needs to be addressed in view of the aforesaid well settled legal position is whether the agreement in question should be interpreted as lease or 27 license having regard to the object sought to be achieved by the provisions of DMC Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 38\\. By reason of the provisions of the DMC Act, the MCD is required to render several services as specified therein for the purpose whereof, tax is required to be imposed both on land as also on building. The definition of \"land\" and '\"building\" as provided in the DMC Act must be given its full effect. As mentioned hereinbefore in the case of Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay case (supra), even an oil tanker has been held to be building.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: 39\\. The tax is imposed upon the holders of land and building by the MCD which is compensatory in nature. The word \"letting out\" in the context of the grant therefore must receive its purposive meaning. The MCD renders services and the benefits of such services are being taken by all concerned, viz., the owner of the land or building. Even a person who is in possession of a land or building, whether legal or illegal, takes benefits of such services rendered by the MCD. The MCD for the purpose of realization of tax is 28 not concerned with the relationship of the parties. It is concerned only with imposition and recovery of tax which is payable on all lands and buildings in accordance with law. The exceptions thereof have been enumerated in the Act itself. Section 119 of the MCD Act is one of such provisions. Such an exemption clause, as is well known, must be construed strictly. Section 119 of the MCD Act would apply if the lands and buildings are the properties of Union of India. The MCD has the right to levy the property tax in terms of Section 114 of the MCD Act in the manner as specified therein.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 40\\. By reason of the agreement in question, the buildings in question do not belong to the Administration. Admittedly, it belongs to the grantee i.e. appellant herein. As discussed hereinbefore, the Oil tanks has been construed as buildings for the purposes of tax. Therefore, Section 119 of the MCD Act would not apply to the building in question. That being the case, the grantee/appellant is liable to pay tax although the ownership of the land may belong to the 29 Administration. Section 115 of the MCD Act clearly provides that the general tax shall be payable in respect of lands and buildings. Such lands and buildings may be in lawful occupation of the owner. The occupation of the said building may be lawful or unlawful. Even in a case where apartments are constructed on the land belonging to the Government or a statutory body but the occupier of the apartment is liable to pay tax. If a person encroaches upon somebody's lands and constructs buildings thereupon, he would also be liable to pay tax. Once it is held that the grantee were liable to pay tax, the same becomes payable from the date of accrual of the liability. The said position is also fortified from specific stipulation in the agreement that the liability to pay all taxes including municipal taxes is on the grantee.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: 41\\. The learned counsel for the appellant has placed strong reliance on the decision of this Court in [?CITATION?] to contend that land belonging to the government is immune from the payment of property tax by 30 virtue of section 119(1) of the DMC Act and Article 285 of the Constitution of India. In the HUDCOs case vacant land of the government, prior to execution of the lease deed in favour of HUDCO, was sought to be taxed and that no building had been constructed by HUDCO. HUDCOs own case was that interest in land could pass only on execution of lease and construction thereon under section 120(2) of the MCD Act. MCD had invoked Section 120(1) DMC Act to fasten liability on HUDCO and not under Section 120(2) DMC Act after construction was made by HUDCO and lease deed executed bythe government. In that case, this Court has held that vacant land belonging to the Government was not taxable by virtue of section 119 DMC Act and Article 285 of the Constitution of India. However, in our considered view, the case at hand is totally different. The HUDCO judgment dealt with the case where vacant land belonging to the lessor/Government and in regard whereto no lease deed had been executed and no construction had been made by the lessee/HUDCO. The land belonging to the central government was sought to be taxed under 31 section 120(1) of the DMC Act which fastens liability on the lessor. Since land belonged to UOI the same was exempted from payment of tax until the lease deed was executed and construction made thereon by HUDCO-under Section 120(2).\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 42\\. Incidence to pay tax under section 120(2) DMC Act is with regard to a composite assessment of land and buildings as section 120(2) talks of a composite assessment only. In the present case vacant land or property of Railways is not under section 120(1) DMC Act, but property tax/Composite Assessment is sought to be made on the installations/stotage depots having been constructed by the appellant-by virtue of Section 120(2) DMC Act. It is important to notice that w.e.f. the date of execution of lease deed and construction made thereon by HUDCO, HUDCO has been paying the property tax. HUDCOs case is therefore not applicable.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: 32\n",
      "Paragraph 73: 43\\. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the considered view that the document in question constitutes lease in favor of the appellant-grantee; and accordingly liable to pay taxes.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: 44\\. In view of the same, we find no merit in the present appeal, accordingly, the same is liable to be dismissed and hence dismissed. No order as to costs. \n"

      "Paragraph 1: Although I agree with the conclusions arrived at by my learned Brother, having regard to the importance of the question involved, I would like to assign additional reasons therefor.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: The High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction in a matter of this nature is required to determine at the outset as to whether a case has been made out for issuance of a writ of certiorari or a writ of quo warranto. The jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of quo warranto is a limited one. While issuing such a writ, the court merely makes a public declaration but will not consider the respective impact of the candidates or other factors Union of India and Others reported in [?CITATION?] A writ of quo warranto can only be issued when the appellant is contrary to statutory rules. [See [?CITATION?]] When questioned, Mr. R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel on behalf of the respondents fairly stated that in this case the High Court was concerned with the question as to whether a writ of quo warranto can be issued or not. Thus, with a view to find out as to whether a case has been made out for issuance of quo warranto, the only question which was required to be considered was as to whether Shri N.A. Acharya fulfilled the qualifications laid down under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act 1946 or not. The Full Bench of the High Court has mainly proceeded on the basis that the Industrial Court was required to have three or more members, one of whom shall be President as specified in sub- section (2) of Section 10 and, thus, a person before he is appointed as the President must necessarily be appointed as a Member. In my opinion, while arriving at the said finding what the High Court has failed to take into consideration was that sub-section (2) of Section 10 did not impose any restriction on the power of the State to appoint a Member or a President.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: The said provision merely speaks of the composition of the Court of Industrial Arbitration. The expression 'shall consist of three or more Members' is important. Sub-section (2) of Section 10 provides for the composition of the Tribunal and nothing else. By necessary implication a President of the Court of Industrial Arbitration would also have to be a Member and precisely that was the reason why no separate qualification for the appointment of a qualification has been laid down in the Act. Sub- section (4) of Section 10 of the Act lays down the eligibility criteria of a Member only. It is, therefore, significant that for the purpose of appointment of a Member as also the President of the Court of Industrial Arbitration the eligibility criteria remain the same.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: The legitimate expectation of a Member to be promoted to the Post of the Chairman as has been submitted by Mr. Venkataramani will, thus, have no relevance as nobody has a vested right to be promoted.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: It may be true that reference has been made by the High Court while making the recommendations to the draft rules known as Draft Recruitment Rules but it appears from the records that the said draft rules, purported to have been framed by the High Court for replacing the Recruitment Rules for the Post of President as contained at Item 34 in the Handbook of Guidelines on Recruitment Rules of Officers under Labour and Employment Department, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, December, 1990, were published in the year 1992.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: It is now trite that draft rules which are made to lie in a nascent state for a long time cannot be the basis for making appointment or recommendation. Rules even in their draft stage can be acted upon provided there is a clear intention on the part of the Government to enforce those rules reported in [?CITATION?] Sub- section (4) of Section 10 of the Act states that a Member of the Industrial Court shall be a person who is or has been a Judge of High Court or is eligible for being appointed a Judge of such Court. Article 217 of the Constitution of India inter alia lays down the qualification to be possessed by a citizen for his appointment as a High Court Judge. It has not been and could not be disputed that Shri N.A. Acharya has the requisite qualification.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: The other and further qualifications for appointment of a member have been laid down in the provisos appended thereto. The qualifications specified in the said provisos are meant for those who do not satisfy the requirements of main provision. First and Second provisos appended to sub-section (4) of Section 10 are exceptions to the main provision. Once it is held that sitting judicial officers can be appointed either as Member or President of the Court of Industrial Arbitration, indisputably the High Court is required to be consulted therefor. It is for the High Court and High Court alone to nominate a person of its choice. Such a practice is followed by all the High Courts of the country and although the ultimate authority is the State, the recommendations made by the High Court is normally accepted.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: A statute as is well-known must be interpreted having regard to the purport and object which it seeks to achieve. The object of the Act is to constitute Industrial Arbitration Court for the purpose of adjudication of the disputes between the management and the workmen. Such courts which are normally manned by the judicial officers cannot be kept vacant for a long time. Whenever they are meant to be filled up by the sitting judicial officers, consultation with the High Court is imperative.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: Although we do not find any difficulty in interpreting the provisions, even if it be assumed that the provisions of Sub-section (2) and sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Act render two different meanings, it is trite, that in such an event the rule of purposive construction should be taken recourse to.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: and Others [(2000) 6 SCC 127] while interpreting the provisions dealing with the question as regard the duties and functions of Committee of Management of the Society constituted under Kerala Cooperative Societies Act, 1969 this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 11: \"The duty of such a committee or an administrator is to set right the default, if any, and to enable the society to carry on its functions as enjoined by law.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: Thus, the role of an administrator or a committee appointed by the Registrar while the Committee of Management is under supersession, is, as pointed out by this Court, only to bring on an even keel a ship which was in doldrums. If that is the objective and is borne in mind, the interpretation of these provisions will not be difficult.\" and Another [(2000) 7 SCC 93], while considering the provisions of the Bombay Money Lenders Act vis--vis the provisions of other Acts upon a purposive and meaningful interpretation held that the banks do not come under the purview of the Assam Money Lenders Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: Others [(2000) 7 SCC 357] this Court noticed:\n",
      "Paragraph 14: \"25. In regard to purposive interpretation, Justice Frankfurter observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 15: Legislation has an aim, it seeks to obviate some mischief, to supply an inadequacy, to effect a change of policy, to formulate a plan of government. That aim, that policy is not drawn, like nitrogen, out of the air; it is evidenced in the language of the statute, as read in the light of other external manifestations of purpose [Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 26\\. That principle has been applied to this very Act Canara Bank. If the said principle is applied, it is clear that the provision in Section 31 must be construed in such a manner that, after the Act, no suit by the Bank is decided by the civil court and all such suits are decided by the Tribunal.\" SCC 538] it was held:\n",
      "Paragraph 17: \"The mere use of the word 'reservation' per se does not have the consequence of ipso facto applying the entire mechanism underlying the constitutional concept of a protective reservation specially designed for the advancement of any socially-and-educationally-backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, to enable them to enter and adequately represent in various fields. The meaning, content and purport of the expression will necessarily depend upon the purpose and object with which it is used.\" The Court while interpreting the provision of a statute, although, is not entitled to re-write the statute itself, is not debarred from \"ironing out the creases\". The court should always make an attempt to uphold the rules and interpret the same in such a manner which would make it workable.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: It is also a well settled principles of law that an attempt should be made to give effect to each and every word employed in a statute and such interpretation which would render a particular provision redundant or otiose should be avoided.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: In [?CITATION?], this Court said:- \"Interpretation must depend on the text and the context.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: They are the basis of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to any as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation, Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place..\" In \"The Interpretation and Application of Statutes\" by Reed Dickersen, the author at page 135 has discussed the subject while dealing with the importance of context of the statute in the following terms:- \".The essence of the language is to reflect, express, and perhaps even effect the conceptual matrix of established ideas and values that identifies the culture to which it belongs. For this reason, language has been called 'conceptual map of human experience'.\" The purport and object of the Statute is to see that a Tribunal becomes functional and as such the endeavors of the Court would be to see that to achieve the same, an interpretation of Section 10 of the Act be made in such a manner so that appointment of a President would be possible even at the initial constitution thereof.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: Such a construction is permissible by taking recourse to the doctrine of strained construction, as has been succinctly dealt with by Francis Bennion in his Statutory Interpretation. At Section 304, of the treatise;\n",
      "Paragraph 23: purposive construction has been described in the following manner:- \"A purposive construction of an enactment is one which gives effect to the legislative purpose by (a) following the literal meaning of the enactment where that meaning is in accordance with the legislative purpose (in this Code called a purposive-and-literal construction), or (b) applying a strained meaning where the literal meaning is not in accordance with the legislative purpose (in the Code called a purposive-and-strained construction).\n",
      "Paragraph 24: In [?CITATION?], it was held that severance may be effected even where the 'blue pencil' technique is impracticable.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: In [?CITATION?], the law is stated in the following terms:- \"I am not reluctant to adopt a purposive construction where to apply the literal meaning of the legislative language used would lead to results which would clearly defeat the purposes of the Act. But in doing so the task on which a court of justice is engaged remains one of construction, even where this involves reading into the Act words which are not expressly included in [?CITATION?] provides an instance of this; but in that case the three conditions that must be fulfilled in order to justify this course were satisfied. First, it was possible to determine from a consideration of the provisions of the Act read as a whole precisely what the mischief was that it was the purpose of the Act to remedy; secondly, it was apparent that the draftsman and Parliament had by inadvertence overlooked, and so omitted to deal with an eventuality that required to be dealt with if the purpose of the Act was to be achieved; and thirdly, it was possible to state with certainty what were the additional words that would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by Parliament had their attention been drawn to the omission before the Bill passed into law. Unless this third condition is fulfilled any attempt by a court of justice to repair the omission in the Act cannot be justified as an exercise of its jurisdiction to determine what is the meaning of a written law which Parliament has passed.\" In Principles of Statutory Interpretation of Justice G.P. Singh, 5th Edition, 1992, it is stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 26: \"The Supreme Court in [?CITATION?] approved the rule of construction stated by DENNING, L.J. while dealing with the definition of 'Industry in the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] . The definition is so general and ambiguous that BEG, C.J. said that the situation called for \"some judicial heroics to cope with the difficulties raised\". K.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: IYER, J., who delivered the leading majority judgment in that case referred with approbation the passage extracted above from the judgment of DENNING,L.J. in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. vs. Asher. But in the same continuation he also cited a passage from the speech of LORD SIMONDS in the case of [?CITATION?] as if it also found a part of the judgment of DENNING, L.J. This passage reads: \"The duty of the court is to interpret the words that the legislature has used. Those words may be ambiguous, but, even if they are, the power and duty of the Court to travel outside them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited.\" As earlier noticed LORD SIMONDS and other Law Lords in Magor and St. Mellon's case were highly critical of the views of DENNING, L.J. However, as submitted above, the criticism is more because of the unconventional manner in which the rule of construction was stated by him. In this connection it is pertinent to remember that although a court cannot supply a real casus omissus it is equally clear that it should not so interpret a statute as to create a casus omissus when there is really none.\" In [?CITATION?] at 524 the rule of addition of word had been held to be permissible in the following words:- \"We are of the view that having regard to the pattern in which clause (a) of sub- section (3) of Section 10 of the Act is enacted and also the context, the words 'if the landlord required it for his own use or for the use of any member of his family' which are found in sub-clause (ii) of Section 10(3)(a) of the Act have to be read also into sub-clause (iii) of Section 10(3)(a) of the Act. Sub- clauses (ii) and (iii) both deal with the non-residential buildings. They could have been enacted as one sub- clauses by adding a conjunction 'and' between the said two sub-clauses, in which event the clause would have read thus : 'in case it is a non-residential building which is used for the purpose of keeping a vehicle or adapted for such use if the landlord required it for his own use or for the use of any member of his family and if he or any member of his family is not occupying any such building in the city, town or village concerned which is his own;\n",
      "Paragraph 28: and in case it is any other non-residential building, if the landlord or member of his family is carrying on, a non- residential building in the city, town or village concerned which is his own'. If the two sub-clauses are not so read, it would lead to an absurd result.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: In [?CITATION?], this Court held:\n",
      "Paragraph 30: \"The court has to interpret a statute and apply it to the facts. Hans Kelsen in his Pure Theory of Law. (p. 355) makes a distinction between interpretation by the science of law or jurisprudence on the one hand and interpretation by a law-applying organ (especially the court) on the other. According to him \"jurisprudential interpretation is purely cognitive ascertainment of the meaning of legal norms. In contradistinction to the interpretation by legal organs, jurisprudential interpretation does not create law\". \"The purely cognitive interpretation by jurisprudence is therefore unable to fill alleged gaps in the law. The filling of a so-called gap in the law is a law-creating function that can only be performed by a law-applying organ; and the function of creating law is not performed by jurisprudence interpreting law. Jurisprudential interpretation can do no more than exhibit all possible meanings of a legal norm.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: Jurisprudence as cognition of law cannot decide between the possibilities exhibited by it, but must leave the decision to the legal organ who, according to the legal order, is authorised to apply the law\". According to the author if law is to be applied by a legal organ, he must determine the meaning of the norms to be applied : he must 'interpret' those norms (p. 348). Interpretation therefore is an intellectual activity which accompanies the process of law application in its advance from a higher level to a lower level. According to him, the law to be applied is a frame. \"There are cases of intended or unintended indefiniteness at the lower level and several possibilities are open to the application of law.\" The traditional theory believes that the statute, applied to a concrete case, can always supply only one correct decision and that the positive-legal 'correctness' of this decision is based on the statute itself. This theory describes the interpretive procedure as if it consisted merely in an intellectual act of clarifying or understanding; as if the law-applying organ had to use only his reason but not his will, and as if by a purely intellectual activity, among the various existing possibilities only one correct choice could be made in accordance with positive law. According to the author :\n",
      "Paragraph 32: \"The legal act applying a legal norm may be performed in such a way that it conforms (a) with the one or the other of the different meanings of the legal norm, (b) with the will of the norm-creating authority that is to be determined somehow, (c) with the expression which the norm-creating authority has chosen, (d) with the one or the other of the contradictory norms; or (e) the concrete case to which the two contradictory norms refer may be decided under the assumption that the two contradictory norms annul each other. In all these cases, the law to be applied constitutes only a frame within which several applications are possible, whereby every act is legal that stays within the frame.\" In [?CITATION?] this Court observed :\n",
      "Paragraph 33: \"It is a well-known rule of interpretation of statutes that the text and the context of the entire Act must be looked into while interpreting any of the expressions used in a statute. The courts must look to the object which the statute seeks to achieve while interpreting any of the provisions of the Act. A purposive approach for interpreting the Act is necessary.\" Another [2003 AIR SCW 653] this Court noticed Section 3 of U.P. Public Services (Tribunal) Act which provided for different qualifications for Chairman, Vice-Chairman (Judicial) and Vice-Chairman (Administration) as also Judicial and Administrative Members of the Service Tribunal. A Bench of this Court of which one of us (Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India) was a member held that as appointment of Chairman, Vice Chairman (Judicial), Vice- Chairman(Administration) and Members are to be made in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Act is intra vires.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: The said decision is also a pointer to show that whenever a post is to be filled up by the Judicial Member who is eligible to be appointed as a High Court Judge, consultation with the High Court is imperative.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: Furthermore, if the interpretation of Section 10 of the Act as propounded by the High Court is accepted, no President can be appointed directly by the State at the time of Constitution of the Court. Such a situation, therefore, would lead to absurdity if it is held that the candidate must first be appointed as a Member and the Post of President can be filled up inter alia by way of promotion or otherwise. When literal interpretation of a provision leads to absurdity or manifest injustice, it is trite, the same must be avoided.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: Furthermore, if the legislature intended to lay down different qualifications or eligibility criteria for the President and the Members, it would have expressly stated so. We may in this connection notice the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: In absence of an express provision providing either for different qualification or eligibility criteria or the selection process, the same procedure for appointment must be followed.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Both under the existing rules as also the Draft Rules mode and manner of appointment have been laid down. Even in absence of the Draft Rules in terms of Rule 34 of the Recruitment Rules for the President of Industrial Court appointment can be made by nomination. Thus, appointment to the Post of President could be made by way of nomination also subject to the nominees holding requisite qualifications laid down therefor.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: It is further trite that non-mentioning or wrong mentioning of a provision of law would not invalidate an order if a source therefor can be found out either under general law or a statute law.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: It is further well-settled that when there are two sources of power, even if one is not applicable, the order will not become invalid if the power of the statutory authority can be traced to another source.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: For the reasons aforementioned, taking any view of the matter it cannot be said that the appointment of Shri N.A. Acharya was illegal or invalid. The impugned judgment, therefore, cannot be sustained which is, therefore, set aside. The appeal is allowed.\n"

The challenge in the writ petition was to the amendment introduced to Sections 2, 4, 9 and 17, as well as insertion of Sections 31-A, 31-B, 31- C, 37-A, 37-B to the Maharshi Mahesh Yogi Vedic Vishwavidyalaya Adhiniyam, 1995 (Act No.37 of 1995), hereinafter referred to as 1995 Act. The amendment was by way of Amendment Act No.5 of 2000, hereinafter called the Amendment Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: 2\\. The Division Bench upheld the amendment to Section 4(1) of 1995 Act. The Division Bench also held that the amendment to Sections 9(2), 31-A(1) and (2), 31-B, 31-C, 37-B(a), 37-B(b), 37-B(d) and 37-B (e) are intra-vires.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: The Division Bench further held that the proviso to Section 4 is intra- vires, as far as it provides that no Centres shall be established without prior approval of the State Government and no centre would mean no further Centres excluding the existing ones. The Division Bench further held that the said proviso as far as it stipulated that no courses should be conducted or run without the prior approval of the State Government is ultra-vires, as far as, it related to the present stream of courses and the existing Centres. Section 37-A was held to be ultra-vires in its entirety.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: Section 37-B (e) was held to be not ultra-vires.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: 3\\. To understand the scope of challenge made in this appeal, the brief facts are required to be stated. The appellant is the University, which was a creation by way of a Statute viz., 1995 Act. Therefore, in the forefront, it will be better to note the scheme of the Act, which received the assent of the Governor on 25th November 1995 and was published in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette dated 29th November 1995. The Preamble of the Act would state that it was an Act to establish and incorporate a University, in the State of Madhya Pradesh and to provide for education and prosecution of research in Vedic learnings and practices and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 2 defines the various expressions, including the expressions Board of Management, Distance Education System, Institution, Statutes and Ordinance and the definition of University under Section 2(u) means the appellant University. Again Section 3(1) refers to the appellant University and Section 3(2) refers to the headquarters of the University to be at village Karondi in District Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, providing for establishment of campuses at such other places within its jurisdiction. Under sub-section (3) to Section 3, the First Chancellor, Vice Chancellor and the first Members of the Board of Management of the Academic Council etc., has been set out.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: 4\\. The crucial section is Section 4 and in particular sub-clause (1) of Section 4, which refers to the powers of the University, which specifically states that such power would provide for instruction in all branches of Vedic Learning, as well as promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit, as the University may from time to time determine and also to make provision for research and for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: 5\\. Sub-clauses (ii) to (xxviii) of Section 4 refers to the various other powers such as granting diplomas and certificates; to organize and undertake extra-mural studies; conferment of honorary degree; facilities for distance education system; to recognize an institution of higher learning for such purposes as the University may determine; to recognize persons for imparting instructions in any college or institution maintained by the University; to appoint persons working in any other University or organization, as a teacher of the University for a specific period; to create teaching, as well as administrative posts; to co-operate or collaborate with any other University or authority; to establish other campus, special centers, specified laboratories etc., to institute and award fellowships, scholarships etc., to establish and maintain colleges and institutions; to make provision for research and advisory service; to organize and conduct refresher courses; to make special arrangements for teaching women students; to appoint on contract or otherwise visiting professors, scholars; to confer autonomous status on a college or an institution or a department; to determine standards of admission of the University etc.; to fix quota for reserved class students; to demand and receive payment of fees and other charges; to take care of the hostels of the students with other inmates of the college; to lay down conditions of service of all categories of employees; to frame discipline; to receive benefications, gifts, etc., and to do all such other acts and things as may be necessary, incidental or conducive for attainment of all or any of its objects.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: 6\\. Section 5 states that the jurisdiction of the University would extend to the whole of the State of Madhya Pradesh. The status of the Chancellor has been described in Section 9. Sub-section (1) of Section 9 recognizes the status of Maharshi Mahesh Yogi as its first Chancellor, who was entitled to hold office during his lifetime. Sub-section (2) to Section 9 provides the manner in which the next Chancellor can be appointed by the Board of Management and the qualification and eligibility for appointment as Chancellor. Section 10 deals with the position of the Vice Chancellor, qualification and procedure for filling up of the said post. Section 11 deals with the status of the Pro-Vice Chancellor. Sections 12, 13 and 14 deals with the position of Deans of Schools, the Registrar and the Finance Officer of the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: 7\\. Section 15 deals with the manner of appointment, powers and duties of the other officers of the University, which has to be prescribed by the Statutes. Sections 17 and 18 specifically deal with the power of the Board of Management and its constitution. Section 19 deals with the Academic Council, while Section 20 deals with the Planning Board and Section 24 enumerates the powers to make Statutes and the provisions to be contained therein. Section 25 enumerates as to how the Statues has to be made.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: Section 26 stipulates as to how all Ordinances should be made. Section 28 deals with the preparation of annual report of the University, including the annual accounts and the balance sheet duly audited by a chartered accountant under the direction of the Board of Management. Sections 30 and 31 prescribe the procedure for appeal and arbitration in disciplinary cases against students. Section 32 deals with the creation of provident and pension funds. Section 34 deals with the constitution of committees, while Section 35 deals with the manner in which the casual vacancies are to be filled up. The transitional provisions are specified in Section 38 of the Act. The last Section 39 stipulates that every Statute, Ordinance or Regulation made under the Act, should be published in the Official Gazette and that it should be laid down, as soon as it is made before the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: 8\\. A conspicuous reading of the above provisions of the 1995 Act, discloses that the appellant University was established and incorporated under Section 3 of the Act. At the very outset, it must be stated that the establishment of the University itself was at the behest of Maharshi Mahesh Yogi, who was the man behind the institution and was an inspiration, if we may say so, for the establishment and effective functioning of it. The State Government came forward to pass the legislation for establishing the appellant University on his initiative and persuasion. It was his vision of spreading total knowledge on the holistic interpretation of the Vedas and it must be stated that his move to propagate natural law and technology of consciousness was very laudable. It is stated that he was instrumental for establishing many such Universities at various places throughout the world. Therefore, it was his vision, as well as mission, to establish this University with the laudable object of spreading the holistic principle enshrined in the Vedas, Upvedas, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas, as well as Gyan-Vigyan.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 9\\. The purport of establishing this University at his instance was to ensure that the ancient knowledge embedded in those Vedas, Upvedas, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas etc., are kept intact and the wealth of knowledge contained in these Vedas, Upvedas etc., are not only spread by establishing an institution, but by teaching them through well established institutions and thereby, ensuring that such wealth of knowledge is kept intact for the future generations to come.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 10\\. In this context, we must state that the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in its scholarly judgment has dealt with the intricacies of the wealth of knowledge contained in Vedas, running for several pages and hence, we only state that the same shall be read as part and parcel of this judgment for its better understanding.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 11\\. When we refer to the subjects dealt with in Vedas, it will be worthwhile to note the details garnered and noted in the judgment of the Division Bench, which in our considered opinion have to be referred to in order to appreciate the challenge made to the amendment by the State Government with particular reference to Section 4(1) of the 1995 Act. In fact the Division Bench has dealt with the above aspects in several pages, however, for the purpose of this case, it will be sufficient if we refer to certain relevant portions of the judgment in order to get a better understanding that the concept of Vedas deals with various aspects of life, which also includes science in general, as well as human autonomy.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: Reference can be made to paragraph 29 and 30 of the judgment, where the Division Bench has noted the four different branches of Vedas viz., Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, along with the four Upvedas viz., Ayurveda, Gandharvaveda, Dhanurveda and Sthapatyaveda. If all these Vedas are understood in their proper perspective, we can find that they deal with various aspects of life, the way of living, the culture, sculpture, medicines and quintessence of civilization and so on and so forth.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: 12\\. The Division Bench has also noted that in Vedas there are formulae, which deals with mathematics. The Vedic sutras enable a person to solve complex mathematical problems because of its cogency, compactness and simplicity. The Division Bench has also stated that it is a total misconception for any one to state that Vedas are only relatable to rituals. It went on to add that mathematicians have observed that while ordinary multiplication methods require many steps, in Sanskrit sutra, only one line method is sufficient. To quote a few, the Division Bench has referred to Urdhwa, Tiryak Sutra, Ekadhiken Purva Sutra and Kalana- Kalna Sutra. A little more detailed analysis made by the Division Bench, as regards the in-depth contents in Vedas can be profitably referred to by extracting paragraph 33 of the judgment of the Division Bench, which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 17: 33. The modern physicists are also connecting certain theories propagated by the ancient Indians. Some scientists have seen atomic dance in the deity of 'Natraj'. The empirical knowledge which has been achieved, had been perceived knowledge which has been achieved, had been perceived by the ancient 'Drastas'. The memories of cells, which is the modern discovery finds place in the wise men of the past. The Psychology, Psychiatry, Neurology had also been adverted in their own way in the Shastras. Presently scholars recognize one continuous shining background which had its base is the pure consciousness.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Thoreau, the eminent thinker, realised this and expressed so through his writing, Psychological quiescence is not unknown to the ancients.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: The principle that there cannot be difference between the body and mind was found by them. The great American, Emerson expressed :\n",
      "Paragraph 20: \"They reckon ill who leave me out; When me they fly I am the wings; I am the doubter and the doubt, And, I the hymn the Brahamana sings.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 21: Possibly for these reasons T.S. Eliot wrote: \"Mankind cannot bear too much of reality.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 22: 13\\. Again in paragraph 43, the Division Bench has highlighted how Vedic learning is also concerned with human anatomy and physiology. It mentions that Atharvaveda gives a picture of human bio-existence in a different manner. It is also stated that Vedas qua human anatomy, coincides more or less with the medical science of today. It is further mentioned that the language of interpretation may be different, but the essence of science is one and the same. The Division Bench states that the Atharvaveda does not perceive mans physiology, as delineated in terms of science, but visualizes in subtler elements, by making specific reference to the nadis, annihilation, exhalation, retention of air in the body, which has its corresponding note in the winds and vayu.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: 14\\. We have ventured to make a detailed reference to the above facets highlighted in the judgment in order to state and understand that by making reference to Vedas and its other allied subjects, one cannot arrive at a conclusion that it only deals with rituals and some religious tenets and that it has nothing to do with other aspects of life. On the other hand, a detailed reference was made by the Division Bench by making an in depth study disclosing that the study of Vedas should enlighten a person in all aspects of life not necessarily restricted to religion or rituals simpliciter.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 15\\. When we attempt to understand the intricacies of Vedas, which as stated by us earlier has been dealt with by the Division Bench in several pages in the opening part of its judgment, we also wish to make a reference to the meaning of the expression Gyan Vigyan, as has been expressed by Dr.Subash Sharma, Dean of Indian Business Academy, Noida in his article From Newton to Nirvana: Science, Vigyan and Gyan. A reading of the said note on Gyan Vigyan by the author really gives a clear picture about the said concept.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: We feel that it is worthwhile to make a brief reference to what has been attempted to be explained by the said author. According to the writer, Gyan Vigyan can be analyzed in two ways, viz., Vishesh Gyan and Vishya Gyan. The world science has linkages with senses and hence, scientific knowledge has got its roots in senses. He would state that the traditional knowledge gets legitimacy only if it can be tested on the basis of objectivity, through the senses. He would elaborate his idea by stating that while science relies on senses, Vigyan i.e. Vishesh Gyan, can be acquired through mind. Therefore, Vigyan is more than science as mind is more than senses. He would conclude his analysis by saying that Gyan both in terms of its metaphysical and spiritual meaning, is acquired through consciousness and that it is more than Vigyan as consciousness is more than mind. If the analysis made by the writer is understood, it can be held that if one represents senses, mind and consciousness in terms of three concentric circles, we may observe that radius of consciousness is larger than the radius of the mind and radius of mind is larger than the radius of the senses.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: 16\\. He would therefore, conclude by saying that just as senses, mind and consciousness are interconnected, the three circles of science, Vigyan and Gyan are also interconnected. It can therefore be safely stated that Gyan Vigyan would be nothing but a systematic study of science through senses, by applying ones mind with absolute consciousness.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 17\\. Keeping the above perception about the basics of Vedas i.e., Upvedas, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas etc., in consonance with Gyan Vigyan, it will be necessary to briefly refer as to how the University came to be established after the coming into force of 1995 Act. It is also imminently required in as much as, such an establishment had resulted in the investment of considerable sum of money for the purpose of imparting education on Vedas and its allied subjects, including Gyan Vigyan and for dissemination of knowledge, as was originally thought of by the lawmakers, while enacting 1995 Act for the purpose of establishing the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: 18\\. One of the main themes, which was propagated by Maharshi Mahesh Yogi was that the solution of the problems in the field of education lies in developing the limitless inner potential of its students and teachers.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: According to him, to achieve the said goal, it was necessary to revive the ancient Vedic science and knowledge for the systematic unfolding of the full range of human consciousness. The said line of thinking of the Yogi contains the technology of the unified field that includes the Transcendental Meditation (TM) and Transcendental Meditation Siddhi Programmes. It was also highlighted by the Yogi that there were enough materials in Vedas, which pertains to seed production, crop production, sericulture, health care, management, beauty culture, marketing and accounting. It was further claimed that Vedas are the structure of pure knowledge, having infinite creative potential, which an individual can harvest. In order to highlight the valueability of the above intricate subjects, considerable investment had to be made while establishing the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: 19\\. It was in this background that the Yogi is stated to have made an attempt for nearly four decades by repeatedly knocking at the doors of the Legislators who came forward with the Statute viz., 1995 Act for establishing the institution with the laudable object of spreading the knowledge on Vedas and its intricate subjects, through the medium of education. After the Statute viz., 1995 Act, came into effect, the appellant University took every effort to create the necessary infrastructure of high standards in education and teaching. It is revealed that the infrastructure comprised of permanent furnished buildings, teachers, staff, transport facilities, library, hostel facilities etc., and the capital expenditure as on 31.03.2000, was stated to be Rupees 12.74 crores. Besides this, the recurring expenditure was also of an equal sum.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: After its commencement, it is stated that 3006 students, who received education from the University, were conferred with certificates/diplomas and degrees. In the academic year 2000-01, the student strength was stated to be 3136 and that it has also awarded Ph.D degrees to 10 students, while 70 other students were pursuing their doctorate education by enrolling themselves with the University. Amongst the 70 students who enrolled themselves for pursuing their doctorate courses in the University, 46 students were granted scholarship in the range of Rs.1500 to Rs.2000 per month.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: 20\\. In the rejoinder affidavit filed in the High Court, the University further claimed that it has Rs.60 crores deposit and has realized a sum of Rs.2.5 crores by way of tuition fees and stated that the University has invested huge sums for the purpose of imparting education in Vedas, as well as in other science and art subjects, which according to the University were essential requirements to be established for the purpose of attaining its objectives.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: 21\\. The appellant University would therefore, contend that in the field of education, though the main objective of the University was to reinforce the greatness of Vedas, Upvedas, agam tantra, itihas, darshan, upanashid, puranas etc., in as much as every other field of education was intrinsically connected with the main objective of spreading the knowledge of Vedas. It was contended that the attempt of the State Government to cripple the activities of the University by restricting the scope of education in the University to Vedas alone would be doing grave injustice to the University, as well as to its beneficiaries.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: 22\\. Having analysed the emergence of the appellant University based on enactment viz., 1995 Act, we are of the considered opinion that it will also be appropriate to emphasis the need of education and its benefits in order to appreciate the issue involved in this litigation in particular to the challenge made at the instance of the appellant to certain of the amendments, which were introduced in the said 1995 Act, by the Amendment Act. It is needless to state that education, a Constitutional right, has been explained as an essential part in every ones life. In order to understand its consequential effects on the society at large, the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, while referring to education has stated, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: Later reinforced by Nelson Mandela Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. The process of learning, as has been highlighted by the father of the nation, emphasises the need for one to have an everlasting thirst for acquiring knowledge by getting himself educated. It is stated that education is the most potent mechanism for the advancement of human beings. It enlarges, enriches and improves the individuals image of the future. A man without education is no more than an animal. Education emancipates the human beings and leads to liberation from ignorance. According to Pestalozzi who is a Swiss pedagogue and educational reformer stated that education is a constant process of development of innate powers of man, which are natural, harmonious and progressive. It is said that in the 21st Century, 'a nation's ability to convert knowledge into wealth and social good through the process of innovation is going to determine its future.' Accordingly the 21st Century is termed as the century of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: 23\\. Mr. Will Durrant defines 'education' as the 'transmission of civilization'. George Peabody has defined 'education' as \"a debt due from present to future generations\". Education confers dignity to a man. The significance of education was very well explained by the US Supreme Court first, in the case of Brown V Board of Education  [?CITATION?];[?CITATION?], in following words: \"It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today, it is principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural value, in preparing him for later professional training and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. Hence, it is said that a child is the future of the nation.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: 24\\. A private organization, named the International Bureau of Education, was established in Geneva in 1924 and was transformed into an inter- governmental organization in 1929, as an international coordinating centre for institutions concerned with education. A much broader approach was chosen, however with the establishment of UNESCO in 1945. United Nations, on 10th December, 1998 adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The Preamble to the UDHR stated that: every individual and organ of society...., shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms.... In accordance with the Preamble of UDHR, education should aim at promoting human rights by importing knowledge and skill among the people of the nation States.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 25\\. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares:\n",
      "Paragraph 39: Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and Professional education shall be generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.\" (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 26\\. The same concept has been repeated in the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which seeks to ensure;\n",
      "Paragraph 41: \"Right to free and compulsory education at least in the elementary stages and education to promote general culture, abilities, judgment and sense of responsibility to become a useful member of society and opportunity to recreation, and play to attain the same purpose as of education.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 27\\. The role of international organizations regarding the implementation of the right to education is just not limited to the preparation of documents and conducting conferences and conventions, but it also undertakes the operational programmes assuring, access to education of refugees, migrants, minorities, indigenous people, women and the handicaps. India participated in the drafting of the Declaration and has ratified the covenant. Hence, India is under an obligation to implement such provisions. As a corollary from the Human Rights perspective, constitutional rights in regard to education are to be automatically ensured.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 28\\. Having briefly analyzed the International Conventions, we would like to refer to the provisions in our own Constitution, which provides for the significance and need for education. The Founding Fathers of the nation, recognizing the importance and significance of the right to education, made it a constitutional goal, and placed it under Chapter IV Directive Principles of State Policy of the Constitution of India. Article 45 of the Constitution requires the State to make provisions within 10 years for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 29\\. Further, Article 46 declares that the state shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people. It is significant to note that among several Articles enshrined under Part IV of the Indian Constitution, Article 45 had been given much importance, as education is the basic necessity of the democracy and if the people are denied their right to education, then democracy will be paralyzed; and it was, therefore, emphasized that the objectives enshrined under Article 45 in Chapter IV of the Constitution should be achieved within ten years of the adoption of the Constitution. By establishing the obligations of the State, the Founding Fathers made it the responsibility of future governments to formulate a programme in order to achieve the given goals, but the unresponsive and sluggish attitude of the government to achieve the objectives enshrined under Article 45, belied the hopes and aspirations of the people. However, the Judiciary showed keen interest in providing free and compulsory education to all the children below the age of fourteen years. In the case of [?CITATION?];[?CITATION?], this Court held that right to education is a fundamental right enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. The right to education springs from right to life. The right to life under Article 21 and the dignity of the individual cannot fully be appreciated without the enjoyment of right to education. The Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 45: \"Right to life\" is the compendious expression for all those rights which the Courts must enforce because they are basic to the dignified enjoyment of life. It extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue. The right to education flows directly from right to life. The right to life under Article 21 and the dignity of an individual cannot be assured unless it is accompanied by the right to education. The State Government is under an obligation to make endeavour to provide educational facilities at all levels to its citizens.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 30\\. In the case of [?CITATION?]), this Court was asked to examine the decision of Mohini Jain's case. In Unni Krishnan (supra) this Court partly overruled the decision rendered in Mohini Jains case. The Court held that, the right to education is implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21 and must be interpreted in the light of the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Articles 41, 45 and 46. This Court, however, limited the State obligation to provide educational facilities as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 47: (i) Every Citizen of this Country has a right to free education until he completes the age of fourteen years;\n",
      "Paragraph 48: (ii) Beyond that stage, his right to education is subject to the limits of the economic capacity of the state.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: His Lordship Mr. Justice Mohan, as he then was, has stated as under in paragraph 10 & 11:\n",
      "Paragraph 50: \"10\\. The fundamental purpose of Education is the same at all times and in all places. It is to transfigure the human personality into a pattern of perfection through a synthetic process of the development of the body, the enrichment of the mind, the sublimation of the emotions and the illumination of the spirit. Education is a preparation for a living and for life, here and hereafter.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 11\\. An old Sanskrit adage states: \"That is Education which leads to liberation\"\\- liberation from ignorance which shrouds the mind;\n",
      "Paragraph 52: liberation from superstition which paralyses effort, liberation from prejudices which blind the Vision of the Truth.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 53: (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 54: 31\\. Further, this Court in [?CITATION?], observed that, to develop the full potential of the children, they should be prohibited from doing hazardous work and education should be made available to them. In this regard, the Court held that the government should formulate programmes offering job oriented education, so that they may get education and the timings be so adjusted so that their employment is not affected.\n",
      "Paragraph 55: 32\\. Again in [?CITATION?], Justice K. Ramaswamy and Justice Saghir Ahmad observed that illiteracy has many adverse effects in a democracy governed by a rule of law. It was held that educated citizens could meaningfully exercise their political rights, discharge social responsibilities satisfactorily and develop sprit of tolerance and reform. Therefore, compulsory education is one of the essentials for the stability of democracy, social integration and to eliminate social evils. This Court by rightly and harmoniously construing the provision of Part III and IV of the Constitution has made Right to education a basic fundamental right.\n",
      "Paragraph 56: 33\\. The Government of India by Constitutional (86th Amendment Act) Act, 2002 had added a new Article 21A, which provides that \"the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years in such manner as the State may, by law determine\". Further, they strengthened this Article 21A by adding a clause (k) to Article 51-A, which provides for those who are a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his/her child or ward between the age of 6 and 14 years.\n",
      "Paragraph 57: On the basis of the Constitutional mandate provided under Articles 41, 45, 46, 21-A, 51-A(k) and various judgments of this Court, both the Government of India, as well as this Court has taken several steps to eradicate illiteracy, improve the quality of education and simultaneously ensure that the dropouts are brought to nil. Some of these programmes are the National Technology Mission, District Primary Education Programme, and Nutrition Support for Primary Education, National Open School, Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and other state specific initiatives. Besides this, several States have enacted legislations to provide free and compulsory primary education such as: The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, The Kerala Education Act 1959, The Punjab Primary Education Act 1960, The Gujarat Compulsory Primary Education Act 1961, U.P.\n",
      "Paragraph 58: Basic Education Act 1972, Rajasthan Primary Education Act 1964, Tamil Nadu Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011, etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 59: 34\\. The right to education will be meaningful only and only if all the levels of education reach to all sections of people, otherwise it will fail to achieve the target set out by our Founding Fathers, who intended to make the Indian society an egalitarian society.\n",
      "Paragraph 60: 35\\. The 15th official census in India was calculated in the year 2011. In a country like India, literacy is the main foundation for social and economic growth. When the British rule ended in 1947, the literacy rate was just 12%. Over the years, India has changed socially, economically, and globally. After the 2011 census, literacy rate in India, during 2011 was found to be 74.04%. Compared to the adult literacy rate here, the youth literacy rate is about 9% higher. Though this seems like a very great accomplishment, it is still a matter of concern that still so many people in India cannot even read and write. The number of children who do not get education especially in the rural areas are still high. Though the government has made a law that every child under the age of 14 should get free education, the problem of illiteracy is still at large.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: 36\\. Now, if we consider female literacy rate in India, then it is lower than the male literacy rate, as many parents do not allow their female children to go to schools. They get married off at a young age instead.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: Though child marriage has been lowered to very low levels, it still happens. Many families, especially in rural areas believe that having a male child is better than having a baby girl. So the male child gets all the benefits. Today, the female literacy levels according to the Literacy Rate 2011 census are 65.46%, where the male literacy rate is over 80%. The literacy rate in India has always been a matter of concern, but many NGO initiatives and government ads, campaigns and programs are being held to spread awareness amongst people about the importance of literacy. Also the government has made strict rules for female equality rights. Indian literacy rate has shown a significant rise in the past 10 years.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: 37\\. According to us, illiteracy is one of the major problems faced by the developing nations. In Africa and South East Asia, it has been identified as a major cause of socio economic and ethical conflicts that frequently surfaced in the region. Therefore, literacy has now become part of the Human Right dialogue. Now most of the nations of the world have also accepted their obligation to provide at least free elementary education to their citizens.\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 38\\. Owens and Shaw have stated in their book Development Reconsidered It is self-evident that literacy is a basic element of a nationwide knowledge system. The most important element of a literacy program is not the program itself, but the incentive to become and remain literate.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 39\\. Education is thus, viewed as an integral part of national development and held as an instrument by which the skills and productive capacities are developed and endowed. Literacy forms the cornerstone for making the provision of equality of opportunity a reality.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 40\\. With great respect, it will also have to be stated that bereft of improvement in the educational field when we pose to ourselves the question as to what extent it has created any impact, it will have to be stated that we are yet to reach the preliminary level of achievement of standardised literate behaviour. In fact, in the earlier years, though the literate level was not as high as it now stands, the human value had its own respected place in the society. It will be worthwhile to recall the control the elders could administer over the youngsters, de hors the lack of education. It is unfortunate that today education instead of reforming the human behaviour, in our humble opinion appear to have failed to achieve its objective. Instead we find troubled atmosphere in the society at large, which calls for immediate reformation with the efforts of one and all.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: Therefore, it has become imperative to see that the institution, the teachers, the parents, the students and the society at large can do for bringing about such a transformation. When by and large the development of education has been achieved and the percentage of literacy has considerably improved, at least to more than 60%, there should not be any difficulty for the educated mass to prevail upon every section of the society in order to ensure that the orderly society emerges, which would pave the way for a decent and safe living for every human being who is part of the society.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: 41\\. We can usefully refer to the importance of the education as highlighted by the seven Judge Bench of this Court in [?CITATION?], it has been held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 81\\. Education according to Chambers Dictionary is bringing up or training;  strengthening of the powers of body or mind; culture.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: 85\\. Quadri, J. has well put it in his opinion in Pai Foundation:\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 287. Education plays a cardinal role in transforming a society into a civilised nation. It accelerates the progress of the country in every sphere of national activity. No section of the citizens can be ignored or left behind because it would hamper the progress of the country as a whole. It is the duty of the State to do all it could, to educate every section of citizens who need a helping hand in marching ahead along with others.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: 90\\. In short, education is national wealth essential for the nations progress and prosperity.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: 42\\. The following quote of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Unni Krishnans case sums up the importance of education;\n",
      "Paragraph 74: Victories are gained, peace is preserved, progress is achieved, civilisation is built up and history is made not on the battlefields where ghastly murders are committed in the name of patriotism, not in the Council Chambers where insipid speeches are spun out in the name of debate, not even in factories where are manufactured novel instruments to strangle life, but in educational institutions which are the seed-beds of culture, where children in whose hands quiver the destinies the future, are trained. From their ranks will come out when they grow up, statesmen and soldiers, patriots and philosophers, who will determine the progress of the land.\n",
      "Paragraph 75: 43\\. Having thus highlighted the importance of Education, when we now refer to the core issue involved in this appeal, the provocation for the appellant to file the writ petition was the amendment introduced by Amendment Act 5 of 2000, by which, Sections 2, 4, 9 and 17 of 1995 Act was amended, while simultaneously Sections 31-A, 31-B, 31-C, 37-A and 37-B were inserted.\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 44\\. Before adverting to the consequence of the amendments introduced to two of the crucial provisions viz., Section 4(1) and its proviso and Section 9(2) of the un-amended Act, it will have to be kept in mind that after the coming into force of the 1995 Act, the appellant University has framed its Statutes, as well as Ordinance No.15. Ordinance No.15, contains the courses of studies, which are numerous. Apart from prime subjects on Vedas there were also other professional courses such as Project Management, Human Resources Management, Financial Management, Marketing Management, Accounting and Auditing, Banking, as well as vocational courses in typing, stenography, secretarial practice, computer technology marketing and sales, dress designing and manufacturing, textile designing and printing, horticulture, seed production, crop production, sericulture, as well as, short term courses in various international topics such as, political science, theory of Government, theory of defense, theory of education, theory of management etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 45\\. One other relevant factor to be noted is that the appellant University was added in the list of Universities maintained by the University Grants Commission, as provided under Section 2(f) of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. The same was addressed by way of a communication to the University Grants Commission dated 24.08.1998, in and by which, the inclusion of the appellant University in the schedule to the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 was notified. One other factor which is also to be kept in mind is that by virtue of the provisions contained in the un- amended Act, the appellant University also opened up as many as 55 centers in which an average of 35 students stated to have got themselves enrolled to pursue various courses of study.\n",
      "Paragraph 78: 46\\. Keeping the above factors and details in mind, when we examine the challenge made in the writ petition, in the forefront, the challenge was to the amendment, which was made to Section 4(1) of the 1995 Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: 47\\. The next challenge was to the proviso to Section 4 and the third crucial challenge was to the amendment to Section 9(2) of the 1995 Act. In fact, Mr.Nagaeshwara Rao, learned senior counsel for the appellant in his submissions, mainly concentrated on the above three aspects on which the amendments impinge upon the rights of the appellant.\n",
      "Paragraph 80: 48\\. In the first instance, we wish to take up the amendment to Section 4(1) of the Act. In order to appreciate the submissions of the respective counsel, it will be worthwhile to note the un-amended Section 4(1), the amended Section 4(1), as well as the Preamble to the Act which are as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 81: \"4 (i) to provide for instruction in all branches of Vedic learning and practices including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas, Upvedas and Gyan- Vigyan and the promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit as the University may, from time to time determine and to make provision for research and for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 82: The amended provision reads as under:-- \"to provide for instruction only in all branches of Vedic learning and practices including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas, Upvedas and Gyan-Vigyan and the promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit as the University may from time to time determine and to make provison for research and for the advancement in the above fields and in these fields may .........\"\n",
      "Paragraph 83: Preamble:\n",
      "Paragraph 84: \"An Act to establish and incorporate a University in the State of Madhya Pradcsh and to provide for education and prosecution of research in Vedic learnings and practices and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 85: 49\\. A reading of the above amendments to Section 4(1) discloses that by way of the amendment, the expression only and the expression in the above fields and in these fields may were added, while the last set of expressions dissemination of knowledge were deleted. After the amendment, the grievance of the appellant was that, prior to the coming into force of the Amendment Act viz., Act 5 of 2000, the Officer on Special Duty, in the Department of Higher Education, sent a memorandum, alleging that the course of study prescribed in Clause 1(i) and (j) of Ordinance No.15, were contrary to the aims and objectives of the University and therefore, not acceptable. The University submitted through its reply vide Annexure P-7, explaining in detail with cogent reasons as to why it was entitled to conduct those courses. It is in the above stated background that the Amendment Act 5 of 2000 came to be introduced.\n",
      "Paragraph 86: 50\\. In the above stated background, when we examine the amendment to Section 4 (1), it is quite apparent that by adding the word only after the expressions instruction in the opening part of the Section and by adding expression in the above fields and in these fields may, the State Legislature apparently wanted to restrict the scope of providing instructions to its students only in respect of studies in branches of Vedic learning and practices, including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas, Upvedas and Gyan- Vigyan and also the promotion and development of study of Sanskrit, which was left to be determined by the University. It was also entitled to make provisions for research and for the advancement in the fields mentioned above. By omitting or by deleting the set of expression dissemination of knowledge, apparently the State Legislature wanted to give a thrust to its intendment of restricting the scope of study in the appellant University to Vedic instructions and its allied subjects.\n",
      "Paragraph 87: By taking up the deletion of the expression dissemination of knowledge, by way of the amendment as stated earlier, the State Legislature wanted to restrict the scope of study in the appellant University to Vedic instructions alone. The expression dissemination of knowledge is, to put it precisely, the spreading of knowledge over wide frontiers. Going by the dictionary meaning and to put it differently, dissemination of knowledge would mean spreading of knowledge widely or disbursement of knowledge widely. Therefore, the said set of expressions on their own, would only mean any attempt for spreading of knowledge or disbursement of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: With the said set of expressions as originally contained in Section 4(1), the question for consideration was as to whether such spreading of knowledge or disbursement of knowledge should be confined only to the exclusive field of Vedic learning alone, or whether it should be read disjunctively to be applied for such spreading of knowledge, on a wide spectrum. In fact, the Division Bench has even concluded that even by retaining these set of expressions, the position would be that such dissemination of knowledge would be referable only to Vedic learning and not for general application.\n",
      "Paragraph 89: 51\\. Mr. Nageshwar Rao, learned senior counsel in his submissions took pains to contend that by reading the un-amended Section 4(1) by virtue of the word and prior to the set of expressions for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, the learned senior counsel contended that the whole idea and purpose, while establishing the appellant University was for the cause of advancement and spreading of knowledge in a wide spectrum and not by restricting it to the field of Vedic learning alone. To reinforce his submissions, the learned senior counsel vehemently contended that Section 4(1), apart from providing scope for Vedic learning and practices, including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas and Upvedas also used the expression Gyan-Vigyan which is nothing but science and technology. The learned senior counsel therefore, contended that apart from spreading the process of learning in the field of Vedas, the establishment of the appellant University was also in other fields such as, science and technology and other vocational courses, by way of dissemination of knowledge. The learned senior counsel therefore, contended that by bringing out the amendment to Section 4(1), by way of an addition to the expressions only and in the above fields and in these fields may, the State Government has violated the Constitutional right of the appellant in the field of education, thereby conflicting with Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 90: 52\\. The learned senior counsel further contended that the State Legislature lacks competence, in as much as education is a subject contained in Entry- 66 of List-I and is already governed by the central legislation viz., the [University Grants Commission Act, 1956]  and therefore, the State was incompetent to restrict the scope of education in various fields by bringing out an amendment, as has been made in Act 5 of 2000.\n",
      "Paragraph 91: 53\\. To support the above submission, the learned senior counsel by referring to the Preamble of 1995 Act contended that the Act was enacted to provide for education primarily and prosecution of research in Vedic learning and practices, apart from providing for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The submissions of the learned senior counsel was that going by the Preamble to the enactment, the purport of the legislation was to provide education in all fields in the forefront, apart from prosecution of research in Vedic learning and practices. The learned senior counsel would contend that the said submission was rejected by the Division Bench by restricting the consideration to the words preceding the expression dissemination of knowledge and by applying the principle Noscitur A Sociis. The learned senior counsel would contend that such an approach of the Division Bench was not justified and relied upon the Devi and Ors.).\n",
      "Paragraph 92: 54\\. The learned senior counsel also referred to Section 6 of the Madhya Pradesh University Act, 1973 and contended that dissemination of knowledge is referable to spreading of knowledge in all other fields which may also include Vedic learning. The learned senior counsel also relied State of Chhattisgarh and Ors.) for the proposition as to how to understand the expression and.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: 55\\. Apart from the submission on Section 4(1), the learned senior counsel, while attacking the amendment made by introducing proviso to Section 4, contended that as far as the introduction of various courses, as well as opening of centers are concerned, they are exclusively governed by the University Grants Commission Regulations, which was framed under the provisions of the [University Grants Commission Act, 1956]  and consequently ultra-vires of the Constitutional provisions. The learned senior counsel relied upon [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?]. Reference was also made to Section 12 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 in support of the said submission.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: 56\\. As far as the challenge relating to Section 9(2) of the Act, was concerned, the learned senior counsel contended that the submission based on Entry 66 of List-I of the Constitution would equally apply to the said challenge. Besides this, he also contended that as the appellant University was created by a Statute, the amendment only seeks to interfere with its independence by casting onerous conditions on the appellant to submit a panel of three persons to the State Government, and by empowering the State Government to grant its approval as a pre-condition for the appointment of the Chancellor. According to the learned senior counsel such a condition imposed was highly arbitrary and therefore, was liable to be set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: 57\\. The learned senior counsel therefore, contended that the insertion of the word only in Section 4(1) of the Act, was made by simultaneously deleting the expression dissemination of knowledge and thereby, the un- amended provision has been made meaningless. According to the learned senior counsel, the conclusion of the Division Bench that even without the deletion, the position remains the same, was not correct because every word in the legislation has a purpose and the principle Noscitur A Sociis was not applicable to the case on hand because the term dissemination of knowledge is of wider import.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: 58\\. The above proposition of law as contended by the learned senior counsel has been widely dealt with by this Court in a catena of decisions right from [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]. It has been held that the legal maxim Noscitur A Sociis, is merely a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider. It is only where the intention of the Legislature in associating wider words with words of narrower significance is doubtful or otherwise not clear that the present rule of construction namely Noscitur A Sociis can be usefully applied.\n",
      "Paragraph 97: 59\\. As far as the proviso to Section 4 was concerned, the submission of the learned senior counsel was, what applied to the courses would equally apply to centers and since the Division Bench has held that the State Government was not competent to legislate, as regards the courses to be introduced, on the same logic, the Division Bench ought not to have set aside the proviso in its entirety.\n",
      "Paragraph 98: 60\\. As against the above submissions Ms.Vibha Datta Makhija, learned counsel for the State contended that the University Grants Commission Rules was related to the standard of education and not on courses. According to the learned counsel, going by the Preamble to 1995 Act, it is categorical and unambiguous to the effect that the establishment of the University was only to provide education in Vedic learning and therefore, it can only be in courses connected with Vedas. As a corollary it was submitted that any course not connected with Vedic learning will stand excluded.\n",
      "Paragraph 99: 61\\. The learned counsel submitted that even going by the un-amended Section 4, it is clear that it referred only to all learning connected with Vedic study, since the various sub-clauses to Section 4 also disclosed that it was more Vedic centric rather than on general subjects. By referring to Section 17, the learned counsel pointed out that the degree of autonomy granted to the appellant University, as compared to other Universities was limited in scope.\n",
      "Paragraph 100: 62\\. The learned counsel also referred to the object and scope of the Madhya Pradesh Vishwavidyalaya Adhiniyam, 1973 (Act 22 of 1973) in particular to the Objects and Reasons and contended by making reference to the object of the said Act, which purported to consolidate and amend the law relating to Universities and to make better provisions for the organization and administration of Universities in Madhya Pradesh. The learned counsel further contended that the various provisions of the said Act viz., Section 4(17), Section 6 (1) & (8), Sections 7, 12, 24, 25, 26 and 39 provides the required authority to the State Government to regulate the manner of functioning of the Universities in the State of Madhya Pradesh, including the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: 63\\. As far as the legislative competence is concerned, the learned counsel referred to Entries 63 to 66 of List-I, which deals with Co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions. By referring to Entry 32 of List  II, which deals with incorporation and regulation of Universities, as well as Entry 25 of List  III, which again deals with Education, including technical education, medical education and Universities, subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I, the learned counsel contended what was taken away was only co-ordination and determination of standards of education as covered by Entries 63 to 66 and by virtue of the enabling provision in Entry 32 of List-II, which empowers the State Government for incorporating an University and regulating its functioning, ample powers are vested with the State Government to pass the impugned legislation. The learned counsel therefore, contended that Section 4(1) only deals with the scope within which the appellant University can function and that it does not talk about curriculum or standard. In such circumstances, when the said provision empowers the University to set up an institution by regulating the same by taking certain measures, it cannot be held that such an exercise can be questioned on the ground of lack of competence.\n",
      "Paragraph 102: 64\\. The learned counsel would contend that the amendment introduced by the State Government was in public interest, which falls squarely under Entry 32 of List-II, as well as Entry 25 of List-III and therefore, there was no repugnancy with Entry 66 of List-I of the Constitution. In support of the above submission, the learned counsel also referred to Section 2(f) of the [University Grants Commission Act, 1956]  and contended that the definition of the term University under the said Act means a University established or incorporated by or under a Central Act, a Provincial Act or a State Act and therefore, the University which was established under the 1995 Act can always be regulated by the State Government by passing appropriate amendments to the Act by which the State created the said University.\n",
      "Paragraph 103: 65\\. The learned counsel also referred to Section 12 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 to contend that the general duty of the Commission is to take, in consultation with the Universities or other bodies concerned, all such steps as it may think fit for the promotion and co-ordination of University education and for the determination and maintenance of standards of teaching, apart from examination and research in Universities for which it can take certain actions. In support of her submission, the learned counsel relied upon the decisions reported in [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 104: 66\\. The sum and substance of the submissions of the learned counsel for the State was that the state had competence to legislate by introducing the amendments, that the autonomy of the appellant University was also subject to the regulation by the State and that the only thing to be ensured was that such regulatory measures should be reasonable and in consonance with Article 19(1)(j) of the Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 105: 67\\. On the proviso to Section 4, the learned counsel contended that so long as the Centre is connected with the establishment of University, it would fall under Entry 32 of List-II and therefore, the said proviso was rightly held to be intra-vires by the Division Bench. According to the learned counsel, the effect of the amendment was not a curtailment, but was only by way of clarification. According to the learned counsel to interpret the amendment, the principle of Mischief Rule will have to be applied. The learned counsel further contended that the word and used in the Preamble, as well as under Section (4), will have to be read conjunctively and relied [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] \n",
      "Paragraph 106: 68\\. Having heard the learned senior counsel for the appellant, as well as the learned counsel for the State, and having bestowed our serious consideration to the respective submissions and having perused the scholarly judgment of the Division Bench and other material papers, at the very outset we are of the view that providing education in an University is the primary concern and objective, while all other activities would only be incidental and adjunct. In this context, it would be worthwhile to emphasis the importance of education which has been emphasised in the 'Neethishatakam' by Bhartruhari (First Century B.C.) in the following words: \"Translation: Education is the special manifestation of man;\n",
      "Paragraph 107: Education is the treasure which can be preserved without the fear of loss;\n",
      "Paragraph 108: Education secures material pleasure, happiness and fame; Education is the teacher of the teacher; Education is God incarnate; Education secures honour at the hands of the State, not money; A man without education is equal to animal.\" For this very reason, we have elaborately stated the importance of education as stated by the Father of our Nation, other renowned Authors and great men in public life as well as the mindset of our Constitutional framers in paragraphs 22 to 42. We have also referred to some of the leading judgments of this Court where it has already been held that Right to Education is a Fundamental Right, guaranteed by Article 21 of our Constitution.\n",
      "Paragraph 109: 69\\. Keeping the said basic principles in mind, when we examine the issue involved in this appeal, the burden of the appellant was that though under Section 4(1), reference to Vedic learning and its allied subjects was made in the opening sentence, the University was not established under the 1995 Act, only for the purpose of imparting education in Vedas alone, but it was intended for spreading the knowledge of Vedas and simultaneously to teach Sanskrit, science and technology and also as specifically mentioned in Section 4, for spreading of knowledge in all fields. In fact, in the pursuit of our above perception, we have quoted extensively the view points of various personalities, as well as the importance of education and the various constitutional provisions, which were incorporated mainly with a view to spread education in the independent India in order to ensure that the Society is enlightened and by such enlightenment the rights of the people and orderly society is ensured in this Country. Also while referring to a decision of this Court rendered in Mamata Mohanty (supra), the importance of imparting education is emphasized as hereunder:\n",
      "Paragraph 110: 29. Education is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given to the young persons in preparation for the work of life. It also connotes the whole course of scholastic instruction which a person has received. Education connotes the process of training and developing the knowledge, skill, mind and character of students by formal schooling. ***\n",
      "Paragraph 111: 33\\. In view of the above, it is evident that education is necessary to develop the personality of a person as a whole and in totality as it provides the process of training and acquiring the knowledge, skills, developing mind and character by formal schooling. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain a high academic standard and academic discipline along with academic rigour for the progress of a nation. Democracy depends for its own survival on a high standard of vocational and professional education. Paucity of funds cannot be a ground for the State not to provide quality education to its future citizens. It is for this reason that in order to maintain the standard of education the State Government provides grant-in-aid to private schools to ensure the smooth running of the institution so that the standard of teaching may not suffer for want of funds.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: 70\\. With the above said prelude, as regards the importance of education in an orderly society, when we come to the core issue, the appellant was aggrieved by the amendment Act 5 of 2000 by which Section 4(1) of 1995 Act was altered and thereby, the State want to contend that the appellant University can impart education only in the field of Vedic learning and practices, including Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas and Upvedas.\n",
      "Paragraph 113: Darshan means a proper reading of ones own self and the environment.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: Agam Tantra is oriental research, which includes history and geography.\n",
      "Paragraph 115: Itihas, Puranas as the very words suggest, relates to history. Upvedas are part of Vedas. The section as it originally stood stated that the University can provide education in all branches of Vedic learning and practices, which also mentioned Gyan-Vigyan, as well as promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit as the University may from time to time determine. It also mentioned that the University can make provision for research and for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: 71\\. According to Mr. L. Nageshwar Rao, the learned senior counsel for the appellant, the words and preceding the expression Gyan-Vigyan, the promotion and development of study of Sanskrit, as well as for the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, have to be read disjunctively and not conjunctively with the first part of the provision viz., providing for instruction in all branches of Vedic learning.\n",
      "Paragraph 117: 72\\. As against the above submission, Ms. Makhija the learned counsel for the State would contend that having regard to the manner in which the provision has been couched, it will have to be read conjunctively and not disjunctively.\n",
      "Paragraph 118: 73\\. Both the learned counsel referred to the Preamble in support of their submissions. When we refer to the Preamble of the 1995 Act, we find that it has been stated that an Act to establish and incorporate a University in the State of Madhya Pradcsh and to provide for education and prosecution of research in Vedic learnings and practices and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\" Here again, while Mr.Nageshwar Rao the learned senior counsel would contend that the expression and used clearly distinguish each set of expression, according to the learned counsel for the State, the same will have to be read conjunctively.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: 74\\. Having considered the various submissions and the analysis made based on detailed circumstances leading to the intricacies of Vedas, the field it covers, as noted by the Division Bench, as well as the concept of education, which has been explained by very many learned and prominent persons to whom we have made detailed references to in the earlier part of our judgment, we are of the considered view that education is the base for every other subject to be taught in the process of learning. Therefore, establishment of the University as the Preamble goes to state was to provide for education in the forefront. It will be appropriate to hold that such a provision for education in so far as the appellant University was concerned, should concentrate and focus in the prosecution of research in Vedic learning and practices and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. While holding so, it will have to be stated in uncontroverted terms that merely because such specific reference was made to prosecution of research in Vedic learnings, it could be held that the imparting of education in the appellant University should be restricted to the said subject alone and not in any other subject.\n",
      "Paragraph 120: 75\\. In our considered view, such a narrow interpretation would be doing violence to the very basic concept of education, and would create a serious restrain on the University, where, imparting of education is the primary objective and dealing with any specific subject may be for enabling any one to acquire special knowledge on such subjects. In other words, any such restrictive interpretation would go against the basic tenets of the concept of education, which no Court can venture to state.\n",
      "Paragraph 121: 76\\. In this context, we must state that if such a narrow interpretation is sought to be placed, it would even create an embargo in the prosecution of research in Vedic learning and practices. In this context, as has been widely considered and referred to by the Division Bench, which we have also noted, in a precise form in the earlier part of the judgment, we find that Vedas has not left any subject untouched. The Division Bench has noted in paragraphs 20 and 30 the various fields, which have been dealt with and associated in Vedas. The Division Bench has gone to the extent of saying that some scientists have seen the atomic dance in the deity of 'Natraj'.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: It has also been noted that mathematic formulae are much more concise and precise in Vedas. It is said that Vedic learning is concerned with human anatomy and physiology. It was further found that there were enough materials in Vedas, which pertains to seed production, crop production, sericulture, health care, management, beauty culture, marketing and accounting. In fact, according to the Maharshi, who was the man behind the establishment of the appellant University, in order to develop the limitless inner potential of students and teachers, the only solution is education and to achieve that end, according to him, ancient Vedic sciences have to be revived and the knowledge for systematic unfolding the range of human consciousness. In fact, this knowledge was stated to be Maharshi technology of the unified field, which included Transcendental Meditation and Transcendental Meditation Siddhi Programmes. It is also stated that Transcendental Meditation is learnt by more than three million people worldwide and implemented in public and private educational institutions in more than 20 countries through Universities, colleges, schools and educational institutions. Therefore, considering the very purport and intent of the Maharshi, who relentlessly fought for the establishment of the appellant University for nearly four decades and ultimately achieved the said objective for establishing the University, it can never be held that his sole purport was only to spread vedic learning and nothing else.\n",
      "Paragraph 123: Therefore, in that view when we examine the respective submissions of the learned counsel we find force in the submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant when he contended that by virtue of the amendment, the un- amended Section 4(1) will become meaningless and that the very purport of establishing the appellant University would become a futile exercise, if it were to restrict its courses only to mere Vedic learning, without providing scope for learning all other incidental and ancillary subjects dealt with by Vedas viz., all other worldly subjects such as, Project Management, Finance Management, Crop Management, Human Resource Management, mathematics and other sciences for which fundamental basic provisions have been prescribed in Vedas and practices including, Darshan, Agam Tantra, Itihas, Puranas and Upvedas.\n",
      "Paragraph 124: 77\\. It will have to be stated that the expression Gyan-Vigyan was specifically mentioned in Section 4(1), not merely to make a scientific study of what is contained in Vedas, as even such a study may not fulfill the purpose for which the University was created. When we think aloud as to what would happen if a scientific study exclusively about Vedas is made, we wonder whether for that purpose a creation of a University would have been necessitated. On the other hand, it is the other way around, in as much as Vedas contains very many scientific subjects such as, mathematics, study about atoms, human anatomy and physiology and other formulae. At this juncture, the inclusion of the expression Gyan-Vigyan, will have to be understood to have been inserted with a view to study modern science and technology as it exists and study the same in consonance with the basic principles contained in Vedas and puranas. In fact, such an approach, while reading the provisions in our considered opinion, would be the proper way of reading the said provisions and not as contended by the learned counsel for the State that the study of Gyan- Vigyan should be exclusively for the purpose of understanding Vedas and Vedic principles. We have earlier explained what is Gyan Vigyan by making reference to an Article From Newton to Nirvana: Science, Vigyan and Gyan by Dr.Subash Sharma, Dean of Indian Business Academy, Noida. Based on the said Article, we have noted that Gyan Vigyan is nothing but a systematic study of science through senses by applying ones mind with absolute consciousness. If it is the meaning to be attributed to the expression Gyan Vigyan, it will have to be held that the said expression used in Section 4(1) cannot be restricted to a mere study on Vedas and its practices. Such a narrow interpretation will be doing violence to the whole concept of Gyan Vigyan, which as explained by Dr. Subash Sharma, is the combination of human senses, mind and consciousness, which should be applied to every aspect of human life, which would include all other academic subjects viz., science, mathematics, philosophy, management, etc.\n",
      "Paragraph 125: 78\\. In this context, when we refer to the expression promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit as the University may from time to time determine, we find that even indisputably the said provision for the study of Sanskrit is totally unconnected to the learning of Vedas and its allied subjects, except that the scripts of Vedas may be in Sanskrit. For that purpose, there need not necessarily be a specific provision to the effect that there should be promotion and development of the study of Sanskrit. Therefore, apart from Vedic learning and its practices, the establishment of the appellant University was for the purpose of providing education in the field of science and technology, intensive learning of Sanskrit and provision for research in every other field for the advancement and disbursement of knowledge.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: 79\\. We are of the considered opinion that only such an interpretation to the un-amended Section 4(1) would be the only way of interpretation that can be accorded to the said provision. Once, we steer clear of the interpretation of the said provision in the above said manner, we find that the amendment, which was introduced by Act 5 of 2000, was clearly intended to purposely do away with its original intendment and thereby, restrict the scope of activities of the appellant University to the learning of Vedas and its practices and nothing else. The restriction so created by introducing the amendment was self-destructive and thereby, the original object and purpose of establishing the appellant University was done away with. In this context, the framing of the Ordinance 15, which provided for the study on various courses in the appellant University was consciously approved by the State Government without any inhibition. A perusal of the course contents in the Ordinance discloses that there were as many as 49 courses connected with Vedic learning and practices and about 33 courses on other subjects. By introducing the amendment under Act 5 of 2000 and thereby, insisting that imparting of education in the appellant University can be restricted only to Vedic learning and that the science and technology should also be only for the purpose of learning Vedas and its practices, will have to be stated unhesitatingly as creating a formidable restriction on the right to education, which is a guaranteed Constitutional right and thereby, clearly violating Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Equally, the addition of the expression in the above fields and in these fields may.........\" while deleting the expression dissemination of knowledge, in our considered opinion, drastically interfered with the right to education sought to be advanced by the University by its creation originally under the 1995 Act, which restriction now sought to be imposed can never be held to be a reasonable restriction, nor can it be held to have any rationale, while creating such a restriction by way of an amendment to Section 4(1).\n",
      "Paragraph 127: 80\\. Having regard to our fundamental approach to the issue raised in this appeal and our conclusion as stated above, we are convinced that the arguments based on the Legislative competence also pales into insignificance. Even without addressing the said question, we have in as much found that by virtue of the amendment introduced to Section 4(1), an embargo has been clearly created in ones right to seek for education, which is a Constitutionally protected Fundamental Right. Therefore, there was a clear violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution and consequently, such a provision by way of an amendment cannot stand the scrutiny of the Court of Law. To support our conclusion, we wish to refer to the following decisions rendered by this Court, right from Mohini Jain case, viz., (i) [?CITATION?] (ii)[?CITATION?] (iii) [?CITATION?] (iv) [?CITATION?] (v) [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 128: wherein, this Court has consistently held that Right to Education is a Fundamental Right. Thus, our conclusion is fortified by the various judgments of this Court, wherein, it has been held that imparting of education is a Fundamental Right, in as much as, we have held that the establishment of the appellant University was mainly for the purpose of imparting education, while promotion of Vedic learning is one of the primary objectives of the University. Any attempt on the part of the State to interfere with the said main object viz., imparting of education, would amount to an infringement of the Fundamental Right guaranteed under the Constitution. Consequently, the amendment, which was introduced under the 1995 Act to Section 4(1) and also the insertion of the proviso, has to be held ultra-vires.\n",
      "Paragraph 129: 81\\. Having arrived at the above conclusion, when we examine the stand of the State, at the very outset, we are not persuaded to accede to the submission of the learned counsel that the amendment was only by way of a clarification of the existing provision. In fact, the Division Bench also proceeded on the footing that dissemination of knowledge as it originally existed, did not empower the University to provide education to other courses other than Vedas and its practices. With great respect to the Division Bench, we are of the view that such an approach was directly in conflict with the basic principle of the Constitutionally protected Fundamental Right, the Right to Education and consequently the said line of reasoning of the Division Bench and the submissions on that basis cannot also be countenanced.\n",
      "Paragraph 130: 82\\. In fact, in this context, the decision relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent State reported in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] rather than supporting the respondent State can be usefully applied to state that dissemination of knowledge in every respect would apply to any subject and cannot be restricted to any particular subject. In paragraph 30 of the said decision, while concluding as to the role of the University Grants Commission in the matter of academic education, it has been stated as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 131: Dissemination of learning with search for new knowledge with discipline all round must be maintained at all costs. It is hoped that University Grants Commission will duly discharge its responsibility to the Nation and play an increasing role to bring about the needed transformation in the academic life of the University. (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 132: 83\\. The above sentence amply establishes that dissemination of learning is for acquisition of knowledge in every kind of discipline and that such a perception should be maintained at all cost. We therefore, hold that dissemination of knowledge as it originally stood in Section 4(1), which was deleted by way of the Amendment Act 5 of 2000, caused havoc by restricting the scope of acquisition of knowledge to be gathered by an individual from the facilities made available in the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: We make it clear that it can never be held that the said expression used in the un-amended Section 4(1) can be held to have a limited application for acquisition of knowledge on Vedas alone and not in other fields.\n",
      "Paragraph 134: 84\\. As far as the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent based on the expression used in the Preamble was concerned, at the very outset, it will have to be held that the Preamble cannot control the scope of the applicability of the Act. If the provision contained in the main Act are clear and without any ambiguity and the purpose of the Legislation can be thereby duly understood without any effort, there is no necessity to even look into the Preamble for that purpose.\n",
      "Paragraph 135: 85\\. In fact, the Division Bench itself has made reference to a decision of and others etc., reported in AIR 2001 SC 724. The extent to which a Preamble of an Act can be referred to or relied upon has been succinctly stated as under :\n",
      "Paragraph 136: The preamble of an Act, no doubt can also be read along with other provisions of the Act to find out the meaning of the words in enacting provision to decide whether they are clear or ambiguous but the preamble in itself not being an enacting provision is not of the same weight as an aid to construction of a Section of the Act as are other relevant enacting words to be found elsewhere in the Act. The utility of the preamble diminishes on a conclusion as to clarity of enacting provisions. It is, therefore, said that the preamble is not to influence the meaning otherwise ascribable to the enacting parts unless there is a compelling reason for it. If in an Act the preamble is general or brief statement of the main purpose, it may well be of little value. We cannot, therefore, start with the preamble for construing the provisions of an Act, though we could be justified in resorting to it nay we will be required to do so if we find that the language used by Parliament is ambiguous or is too general though in point of fact Parliament intended that it should have a limited application. (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 137: 86\\. The above statement of law makes the position abundantly clear that it is the statutory provision, which will have to be read and analyzed for the purpose of understanding the scope and purport for which the Legislation was intended and the brief statement contained in the Preamble will be of very little value. That apart, we have noted in the earlier part of the judgment as to how even a reading of the Preamble shows the importance attached to imparting of education in the appellant University, as has been highlighted in the forefront while making a mention about the other aspects of providing scope for research oriented education on Vedas and its practices by the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 138: 87\\. In the light of our above discussions, we hold that the submission of the learned counsel for the State by making a detailed reference to the Preamble is of no assistance to the respondents. For the very same reason, the arguments of the learned counsel that any course to be conducted in the appellant University should be Vedic centric cannot also be countenanced.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: On the other hand, as held by this Court in Osmania University case, dissemination of knowledge as originally incorporated in the un-amended Section 4(1) alone would serve the purpose of effective functioning of the appellant University in imparting and spreading knowledge on every other field available, apart from providing intensive educational curriculum in Vedic learning and its practices.\n",
      "Paragraph 140: 88\\. In the light of our above conclusion, the deletion of the said expression will have to be held to be an arbitrary action of the respondent State and thereby, violating equality in law and equal protection of law as enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution, in as much as all other Universities, which were being controlled and administered by the State by the 1973 Act, enjoy the freedom of setting up any course with the approval of the University Grants Commission, the appellant alone would be deprived of such a right and liberty by restricting the scope of imparting education in any field other than Vedas and its practices.\n",
      "Paragraph 141: 89\\. As far as the decision relied upon by the learned counsel for the State for the proposition that the word and in the Preamble, as well as in Section 4 will have to be read conjunctively viz., the decision reported in of Orissa and others), in the light of our conclusions based on the context in which the 1995 Act was brought into force and the reading of Section 4(1) in the said context, the expression and used in the said Section will have to be necessarily read disjunctively. We do not find any scope to apply the said decision to the facts of this case.\n",
      "Paragraph 142: 90\\. As far as the decision reported in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] Bank of find the following paragraph as more relevant in order to appreciate the present controversy with which we are concerned; paragraph 33 reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 143: 33\\. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored.\n",
      "Paragraph 144: Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act.\n",
      "Paragraph 145: No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place. (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 146: 91\\. Reading the said paragraph and having analyzed the 1995 Act on the whole along with the Preamble, the various definition clauses, Section 4(1) and the sub-clauses (ii) to (xxviii) and the provision providing for enacting the Statutes and Ordinances, we have to hold that the expression and used in Section 4(1) will have to be read disjunctively and not conjunctively. In this context, we wish to rely on the decision rendered by this Court in Prof. Yashpal and another (supra), wherein, it has been held in paragraph 17 as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 147: 17. In Constitutional Law of India by Seervai, the learned author has said in para 2.12 (3rd Edn.) that the golden rule of interpretation is that words should be read in their ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning subject to the rider that in construing words in a Constitution conferring legislative power the most liberal construction should be put upon the words so that they may have effect in their widest amplitude. This is subject to certain exceptions and a restricted meaning may be given to words if it is necessary to prevent a conflict between two exclusive entries. (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 148: 92\\. Besides the above two decisions, which discuss about the methodology of interpretation of a Statute, we also refer to the following decisions rendered by this Court in Ishwar Singh Bindra (supra), wherein in para 11 it has been held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 149: 11..It would be much more appropriate in the context to read it disconjunctively. In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 3rd Edn. it is stated at p. 135 that and has generally a cumulative sense, requiring the fulfillment of all the conditions that it joins together, and herein it is the antithesis of or. Sometimes, however, even in such a connection, it is, by force of a contexts, read as or. Similarly in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 11th Edn., it has been accepted that to carry out the intention of the legislature it is occasionally found necessary to read the conjunctions or' and and' one for the other.(Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 150: 93\\. We may also refer to para 4 of the decision rendered by this Court in Quarries (P) Ltd.,) :\n",
      "Paragraph 151: 4. According to the plain meaning, the exclusionary clause in sub- section (1) of Section 3 of the Act read with the two provisos beneath clauses (a) and (b), the word and at the end of para (b) of sub- clause (ii) of the proviso to clause (a) of Section 3(1) must in the context in which it appears, be construed as or; and if so construed, the existence of any one of the three conditions stipulated in paras (a), (b) and (c) would at once attract the proviso to clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 3 and thereby make the mine subject to the provisions of the Act. The High Court overlooked the fact that the use of the negative language in each of the three clauses implied that the word and used at the end of clause (b) had to be read disjunctively. That construction of ours is in keeping with the legislative intent manifested by the scheme of the Act which is primarily meant for ensuring the safety of workmen employed in the mines. (Emphasis added)\n",
      "Paragraph 152: 94\\. Applying the ratio as laid down in the above mentioned decisions, we are convinced that our above conclusion is fully supported by the said principles and therefore, we are not inclined to hold that the expression and used in the Preamble, as well as in Section 4 should be read conjunctively as contended by the learned counsel for the State. On the other hand, in the context in which the said expression is used, it will have to be read as or creating a disjunctive reading of the provision.\n",
      "Paragraph 153: 95\\. In this context it will be worthwhile to refer to [?CITATION?], You do sometimes read or as and in a statute. But you do not do it unless you are obliged because or does not generally mean and and and does not generally mean or .\n",

      "Paragraph 156: 96\\. The decision relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the appellant reported in Hansoli Devi (supra), para 9 also supports the above proposition of law. Para 9 of the said decision reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 157: 9. Before we embark upon an inquiry as to what would be the correct interpretation of Section 28-A, we think it appropriate to bear in mind certain basic principles of interpretation of a statute. The rule stated by Tindal, C.J. in Sussex Peerage case still holds the field.\n",
      "Paragraph 158: The aforesaid rule is to the effect: (ER p. 1057) If the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves alone do, in such case, best declare the intention of the lawgiver. It is no doubt true that if on going through the plain meaning of the language of statutes, it leads to anomalies, injustices and absurdities, then the court may look into the purpose for which the statute has been brought and would try to give a meaning, which would adhere to the purpose of the statute\n",
      "Paragraph 159: 97\\. The above said proposition of law laid down by this Court fully supports the claim of the appellant.\n",
      "Paragraph 160: 98\\. With this, when we come to the other submission of the learned counsel for the appellant relating to the challenge made to the proviso added to Section 4., the proviso which has been added is to the effect that no courses should be conducted and no centers should be established or run without the prior approval of the State Government. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant before the Division Bench, as well as before us was that the creation of courses, as well as the centers are governed by the provisions of 1995 Act and such activities of the appellant University can at best be regulated only by the University Grants Commission, by virtue of the statutory prescription under Section 12 of the [University Grants Commission Act] , read along with Entry 66 of List-I of the Constitution and that the State Legislature has no competence to deal with the said issue.\n",
      "Paragraph 161: 99\\. While dealing with the above contention, the Division Bench after making a detailed reference to various Entries commencing from Entries 63 to 66 of List-I, as well as Entry 25 of List-III and also Section 12 of the Universities Grants Commission Act, 1956 ultimately held that having regard to the inclusion of the appellant University in the list of Universities maintained by the Commission under Section 2(f) of the 1956 Act, as reflected in Annexure P-5, dated 24.08.1988, the existence of Ordinance 15, which came into being in accordance with law that once the University Grants Commission Act is in force, the running of the courses and determination thereof, has to be controlled by the University Grants Commission. The proviso stipulating that no course should be conducted and no centers should be established and run without the prior approval of the State Government. The restriction is so far as it related to conduct of courses is concerned, the same was beyond the Legislative competence of the State Legislature. So holding thus, the Division Bench declared that the proviso so far as it related to the aspect that no course should be conducted and run without the prior approval of the State, was ultra vires and beyond the Legislative competence of the State Legislature.\n",
      "Paragraph 162: 100\\. This Court in Prof. Yashpal and another (supra) held in paragraphs 28, 33 and 34 as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 163: 28. Though incorporation of a university as a legislative head is a State subject (Entry 32 List II) but basically a university is an institution for higher education and research. Entry 66 of List I is coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions. There can thus be a clash between the powers of the State and that of the Union. The interplay of various entries in this regard in the three lists of the Seventh Schedule and the real import of Entry 66 of List I have been examined in several decisions of this Court. In Gujarat University v. Krishna Ranganath Mudholkar a decision by a Constitution Bench rendered prior to the Forty-second Amendment when Entry 11 of List II was in existence, it was held that Items 63 to 66 of List I are carved out of the subject of education and in respect of these items the power to legislate is vested exclusively in Parliament. The use of the expression subject to in Item 11 of List II of the Seventh Schedule clearly indicates that the legislation in respect of excluded matters cannot be undertaken by the State Legislatures. In AIR para 23, the Court held as under: (SCR pp. 137-38) Power of the State to legislate in respect of education including universities must to the extent to which it is entrusted to the Union Parliament, whether such power is exercised or not, be deemed to be restricted. If a subject of legislation is covered by Items 63 to 66 even if it otherwise falls within the larger field of education including universities power to legislate on that subject must lie with Parliament.  Item 11 of List II and Item 66 of List I must be harmoniously construed. The two entries undoubtedly overlap: but to the extent of overlapping, the power conferred by Item 66 List I must prevail over the power of the State under Item 11 of List II. It is manifest that the excluded heads deal primarily with education in institutions of national or special importance and institutions of higher education including research, sciences, technology and vocational training of labour. ***\n",
      "Paragraph 164: 33\\. The consistent and settled view of this Court, therefore, is that in spite of incorporation of universities as a legislative head being in the State List, the whole gamut of the university which will include teaching, quality of education being imparted, curriculum, standard of examination and evaluation and also research activity being carried on will not come within the purview of the State Legislature on account of a specific entry on coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical education being in the Union List for which Parliament alone is competent. It is the responsibility of Parliament to ensure that proper standards are maintained in institutions for higher education or research throughout the country and also uniformity in standards is maintained.\n",
      "Paragraph 165: 34\\. In order to achieve the aforesaid purpose, Parliament has enacted the [University Grants Commission Act]  is illustrative and consequently it is being reproduced below:\n",
      "Paragraph 166: The Constitution of India vests Parliament with exclusive authority in regard to coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions. It is obvious that neither coordination nor determination of standards is possible unless the Central Government has some voice in the determination of standards of teaching and examination in universities, both old and new. It is also necessary to ensure that the available resources are utilised to the best possible effect. The problem has become more acute recently on account of the tendency to multiply universities. The need for a properly constituted Commission for determining and allocating to universities funds made available by the Central Government has also become more urgent on this account. (Emphasis added) 101\\. In yet another decision, this Court has held in para 7 of the decision reported in R. Chitralekha (supra) as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 167: 7. This and similar other passages indicate that if the law made by the State by virtue of entry 11 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution makes impossible or difficult the exercise of the legisiative power of the Parliament under the entry \"Co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions\" reserved to the Union, the State law may be bad. This cannot obviously be decided on speculative and hypothetical reasoning. If the impact of the State law providing for such standards on entry 66 of List I is so heavy or devastating as to wipe out or appreciably abridge the central field, it may be struck down. But that is a question of fact to be ascertained in each case.\n",
      "Paragraph 168: 102\\. While considering the submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant, it will be worthwhile to make a reference to Section 12 of the [University Grants Commission Act, 1956]  wherein while describing the functions of the University Grants Commission, it has been stipulated that it is the general duty of the Commission to take, in consultation with the Universities or other bodies concerned, all such steps as it may think fit for the promotion and co-ordination of University education and for the determination and maintenance of standards of teaching, examination and research in Universities, and for the purpose of performing its functions under this Act, the Commission may hold certain enquiry and do certain other activities. In fact, the Division Bench while holding that conduct of courses come exclusively within the realm of control of the University Grants Commission, apparently relied upon the said provision.\n",
      "Paragraph 169: 103\\. In fact the Division Bench has made a specific reference to the expression used in the said Section, while ultimately holding that it was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University Grants Commission i.e., the running of the Courses. The Division Bench has held to the effect we have no hesitation in our mind that once the University Grants Commission Act is in force, the running of the courses and determination thereof has to be controlled by the University Grants Commission. The said sets of expressions have been more or less borrowed from the expression used in Section 12 itself.\n",
      "Paragraph 170: 104\\. When we examine the ultimate conclusion of the Division Bench that such a control by the University Grants Commission will not extend to the running of the centers, we are of the considered view that what all may apply to conduct of courses, should equally apply to the running of centers as well. In this context, it will be worthwhile to make a further reference to the stipulation contained in Section 12 of the University Grants Commission Act, which makes the position clear. Under Section 12, the general duty of the Commission to take in consultation with the Universities or other bodies is concerned, is all such steps as it may think fit for the promotion and co- ordination of University education and for the determination and maintenance of standards of teaching, examination and research in Universities. It also further stipulates that such a decision should be taken by the University Grants Commission for the purpose of the Universities to perform its functions under the Act. The Division Bench itself has noted that the running of the courses and determination thereof, can be controlled only by the University Grants Commission by virtue of the operation of Section 12. If it is for the University Grants Commission to take a decision in consultation with the Universities, such steps as it thinks fit for the promotion and co- ordination of Universities education, then it will have to be held that, that it should include, apart from the course content, the manner in which education is imparted viz., the process of teaching, while at the same time ensuring the standard of such teaching is maintained by deciding as to whether such teaching process can be allowed to be imparted in places other than the University campus viz., in the centers or other colleges.\n",
      "Paragraph 171: 105\\. In our considered opinion, Section 12 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 would encompass apart from determining the course contents with reference to which the standard of teaching and its maintenance is to be monitored by the University Grants Commission, would also include the infrastructure that may be made available, either in the University or in other campuses, such as the centers, in order to ensure that such standard of education, teaching and examination, as well as research are maintained without any fall in standrard. Therefore, while upholding the conclusion of the Division Bench that it is beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature to stipulate any restriction, as regards the conduct of the courses by getting the approval of the State Government, in the same breath, such lack of competence would equally apply to the running of the centers as well.\n",
      "Paragraph 172: 106\\. In Dr. Preeti Srivastava (supra) while dealing with the scope of Entry 66 of List-I vis-a-vis Entry 25 of List-III, this Court considered on what basis the standard of education in an institution can be analyzed. In paragraph 36, it has been held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 173: 36.. Standards of education in an institution or college depend on various factors. Some of these are:\n",
      "Paragraph 174: (1) The caliber of the teaching staff; (2) A proper syllabus designed to achieve a high level of education in the given span of time; (3) The student- teacher ratio; (4) The ratio between the students and the hospital beds available to each student; (5) The caliber of the students admitted to the institution; (6) Equipment and laboratory facilities, or hospital facilities for training in the case of medical colleges; (7) Adequate accommodation for the college and the attached hospital; and (8) The standard of examinations held including the manner in which the papers are set and examined and the clinical performance is judged. 107\\. The above statement of law on Entry 66 of List-I vis-a-vis Entry 25 of List-III throws much light on this issue. For instance, in the case of the appellant, while it has got its own infrastructure facilities for imparting education on various courses spelt out in Ordinance 15, which has opened up centers in various places falling within its jurisdiction viz.\n",
      "Paragraph 175: the State of Madhya Pradesh for imparting education on the very same courses specified in Ordinance 15. If we apply the principle spelt out in paragraph 36 of the above decision, where the standard for examining the standard on education of an University, the various factors culled out in the said paragraph can be held to be the factors to be considered. In the same line of reasoning, it will have to be held that the various centers created by the appellant University, would also fall as one of the items along with the eight items spelt out in the said paragraph.\n",
      "Paragraph 176: 108\\. In the light of the said reasoning also, it will have to be held that the running of centers by the appellant University would fall within the exclusive realm of Entry 66 of List  I, which would in turn be governed by Section 12 of the [University Grants Commission Act]  and consequently the State Government to that extent should be held to lack the necessary legislative competence to meddle with such centers set up by the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 177: 109\\. We therefore, hold that the entire proviso to Section 4(1) has to be held to be ultra-vires. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant therefore, merits acceptance and the contention to the contrary made by the learned counsel for the State stands rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 178: 110\\. It is also necessary to note, as well as mention that after the University was established for its initial establishment and for running the institution, according to the appellant, more than Rs.12 crores were spent by way of an investment and that nearly Rs.60 crores have been spent for running the University and its various centers throughout the State of Madhya Pradesh. The recurring expenditure was stated to be Rs.11 crores.\n",
      "Paragraph 179: Therefore, when the appellant University has proceeded to establish its institution for the purpose of imparting education by making huge investments, a major part of which would have definitely come by way of fees collected from the students who had joined the institution aspiring for improving their educational career, in our considered opinion, it is the responsibility of the State to ensure that such high expectation of the students who joined the appellant university is not impaired and that for whatever expenses incurred by the students, appropriate returns should be provided to them by way of imparting education in the respective fields which, they choose to associate themselves by getting themselves admitted in the appellant University. Therefore, on this ground as well, it will have to be held that such expectations of the students, as well as their parents cannot be dealt with so very lightly by the State, while considering for any change to be brought about in the Constitution and functioning of the appellant University. It can therefore be validly held that such expectations of the students and their parents, as well as that of the appellant University, can validly be held to be a legitimate expectation and considering the challenge made to the amendment introduced on various grounds raised at the instance of the appellant, the legitimate expectation of the appellant University, as well as the student community, would also equally support the contentions of the appellant University, while challenging the amendments in particular the amendment introduced to Section 4(1), as well as the addition of a proviso to the said Section.\n",
      "Paragraph 180: 111\\. One other relevant factor which is also to be kept in mind is the establishment of the appellant University at the repeated persuasion of Maharshi Mahesh Yogi was definitely to provide full-fledged education on Vedas and the various intricate subjects, which are found in Vedas, as well as its practices, Ithihas, Puranas etc. In fact, there can be no two opinion that such an institution with such a laudable objective for imparting education in different fields based on the teachings in Vedas, was very rare and it is said that the appellant University is stated to be an unique University created and established by the founders of the said institution headed by Maharshi Mahesh Yogi. Therefore, when such a premium University, which is stated to be only one of its kind in the whole of the Country was successfully established based on the 1995 Act, in our considered opinion, such a well established institution should be allowed to survive by enabling the said University to conduct courses as has been planned by it and introduced under Ordinance 15 and thereby, make the appellant University a viable one. Such an approach alone, in our considered view, ensure the successful existence and continued running of the University in the further years and thereby, benefit very many aspirants from among the younger generation who wish to learn more and more about very many subjects by understanding such subjects based on the teachings that are found and established in Vedic learnings, its practices, Ithihas and Puranas etc. Therefore, on this ground as well, in our considered opinion, any attempt made from any quarters, which would disrupt the running of the appellant University, will only amount to interfering with its various Constitutional rights and fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. Therefore, when such interference is brought to the notice of this Court, the Court has to necessarily come to the rescue of the appellant University by saving it from any such onslaught being made on its continued existence. We, therefore, find force in the submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant while attacking the amended Section 4(1) and its proviso, by which the appellant University was deprived of its valuable right to hold very many programmes in the conduct of the course enumerated in its Ordinance 15, which consequently resulted in violation of its Constitutional, as well as Fundamental Rights in the running of its educational institutions.\n",
      "Paragraph 181: 112\\. With this, we come to the last part of the submission made on behalf of the appellant, which related to the amendment to Section 9(2) of the 1995 Act. Under the un-amended provision, after the first Chancellor viz., Maharshi Mahesh Yogi, the Board of Management was empowered to appoint the Chancellor from among the persons of eminence and renowned scholar of Vedic education who can hold office for a term of five years and who would be eligible for reappointment. Under the amended Section 9(2), it was stipulated that after the first Chancellor, the Board of Management should prepare and submit a panel of three persons to the State Government and out of the panel, one person should be appointed as Chancellor by the Board of Management, after obtaining the approval of the State Government. As far as the period of holding office was concerned, there was no change in its terms. The Division Bench while considering the said amendment introduced under Act 5 of 2000, has held that even after the amendment, the Management had the power of recommendation and they can recommend a person of eminence and renowned scholar of Vedic education and even if the ultimate appointment is to be made with the approval of the State Government, since any such appointment can be only from the panel prepared by the Board of management, such a stipulation contained in the amendment does not in any way impinge upon any right, much less the Constitutional Right or Fundamental Right of the appellant University.\n",
      "Paragraph 182: 113\\. Having bestowed our serious consideration to the above conclusion of the Division Bench, we do not find anything wrong with the said conclusion.\n",
      "Paragraph 183: We also hold that the said provision does not in any way offend Article 14 of the Constitution, nor does it affect the autonomy of the appellant University. Apart from the above challenges, no other submission relating to the other amended provisions were seriously argued before us.\n",
      "Paragraph 184: 114\\. In the light of our above conclusion, this appeal is partly allowed.\n",
      "Paragraph 185: We hold that the amended Section 4(1) under Act 5 of 2000 inclusive of the introduction of proviso to the said Section is ultra-vires of the Constitution and the same is liable to be set aside. In other respects, the judgment of the Division Bench stands confirmed. The application for intervention considered, no merits, the same is dismissed.\n"

      "Paragraph 1: Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: 1\\. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court setting aside the judgment of acquittal recorded by learned Principal, Assistant Sessions Judge, Tirunelveli. The appellant faced trial along 1 with one Velliah for alleged commission of offences punishable under Section 307 and 307 read with Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short `IPC'). Though the trial Court found that the prosecution has not established the case, in appeal filed by the State it was held by the High Court that the prosecution established the accusations against the appellants. But the acquittal so far as the Velliah A3 is concerned, the High Court confirmed the acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: 2\\. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 4: Sankaralingam (PW1), Ramaiah (PW2) and Paramasivam (PW6) are brothers. They reside at Marugal Kurichi village.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: Accused 1 to 3 are also residing in the same village. Their house is situated very near to the house of PWs. 1, 2 and 6.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: Accused 1 and 2 are brothers.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: On 2.10.1989 at about 5.00 p.m. Kannammal, the mother of PWs. 1 and 2 went to the corner of the street to collect water from the common water pipe. The third 2 accused's wife Manickam also came to take water. While collecting water from the common pipe, there was a quarrel between Kannammal and Manickam, the wife of third accused. Ramaiah (PW 2) who noticed this, went there and separated them and took his mother to his house.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: Next day i.e. 3.10.1989 at about 7.30 a.m. Ramaiah (PW.2), Sankaralingam (PW.1) and one Manickam, wife of another brother, went to the well, which is situated in Nallakannau Thevar's garden, in order to take bath. When the first accused came to know about the occurrence which took place on the earlier day, he had grievance against PW.2 thinking that PW.2 abused the wife of the third respondent in support of his mother.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: At about 7.30 a.m. when PWs. 1 and 2 and another went near the well, A1 to A3 waylaid them. A1 and A2 were having `Aruval' with them. A3 caught hold of PW.2 from behind his back. At that time, A1 and A2 with `Aruval' attacked PW.2 indiscriminately on the back, left shoulder, right shoulder, 3 hands, etc. PW.2 received number of bleeding injuries all over the body and began to cry. Sankaralingam (PW.1) and Poolu Thevar (PW.5) and two others went near the injured. The accused persons threatened them that they would kill them also. PW.2 swooned and fell on the ground. Thereafter, the accused took to their heels.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: PWs. 1 and 5 took the victim in a car to Naguneri Government Hospital at about 8.30 a.m. Dr. Andiappan (PW.3) examined the victim and found nine injuries. He also sent Ex.P-2 intimation to the Nanguneri Police Station. Head Constable (PW.7) came and recorded statement from PW.1.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: Ex.P-1 is the complaint and the same was registered against the accused for the offences under Sections 341, 342 and 307 IPC. Ex.P-7 is the printed FIR. Doctor (PW.3) sent the victim to the Tirunelveli Hospital for further treatment. He issued Ex.P-3 wound certificate. Doctor (PW.4) took X-Ray and issued Ex.P-4 X-Ray report and the X-Rays were marked as M.Os. 3 to 9\\.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: 4 Gnana Diraviyam (PW.8), the Inspector of Police, took up further investigation and went to the scene and examined the witnesses. He prepared Ex.P-5 observation mahazar and Ex.P-8 rough sketch. He also recovered sample earth and blood stained earth. Thereafter, he went to the hospital and recorded the statement from PW.2. Since the PW.8 was subsequently transferred, Periasamy (PW.9) another Inspector of Police, took up further investigation.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: 3\\. After completion of investigation charge sheet was filed and the accused persons faced trial as they denied the accusations. Nine witnesses were examined to further the prosecution version. Trial court found the evidence of prosecution witnesses to be not cogent and credible and accordingly directed acquittal. State preferred appeal against acquittal. High Court found that the reasoning indicated by the Trial Court to direct the acquittal cannot be maintained. It is to be noted that the acquittal was directed by the Trial Court, inter alia, on the following grounds:\n",
      "Paragraph 14: 5 (i) Recording of Ex.P-1 statement given by PW.1 by PW.7 is doubtful. According to PW.3 Doctor, the injured was conscious, when he was admitted in the hospital. PWs. 1 and 7 would state that the complaint was given by PW.1 which was recorded by PW.7, since PW.2 was unconscious. There is no reason as to why PW.7 had to obtain Ex.P-1 complaint from PW.1, when PW.2 was conscious.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: (ii) PW.1 could not have seen the occurrence. PW.5, an independent eye witness, would state that PW.1 came to the scene only after the occurrence.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: Therefore, the evidence of PW.1 is unreliable.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: (iii) PW.6 stated in the court that he had also seen the occurrence. According to PW.8, the investigating officer, PW.6 was not the eye-witness and he did not give any statement that he saw the occurrence.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: Therefore, the evidence of PW.6 is unreliable.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: (iv) PW.7 head constable recorded Ex.P-1 and the same was written by him. But, in evidence, he would state that he dictated to a constable and the said constable had written the same. There is no evidence to show that any constable accompanied PW.7. Therefore PW.7 had not recorded Ex.P-1 at the hospital.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: (v) PW.5 an independent witness, would state that A1 and A2 alone were present and attacked PW.2. He did not refer about A3. Therefore, A3 could not have been present. Furthermore, A3 produced a certificate alongwith his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. to show that during the relevant time, he was working in the mill in which he was employed.\n",
      "Paragraph 21: 6 (vi) Both in Ex.P-1 and in the evidence of PWs.1 and 2, there is a reference about one Thangapandi stating that he was also one of the eye-witnesses. The said eye-witness was not examined. There is no reason for his non-examination.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: (vii) According to PWs.1 and 2, both A1 and A2 attacked PW.2 indiscriminately. But according to PW.5, after first cut, PW.2 ran to a distance of about 50 feet and thereafter, the further cuts given by the accused with `Aruval\" fell on PW.2 victim. So, there is a contradiction between the evidence of PWs.1 and 2 on the one side and the evidence of PW.5 on the other side.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: 4\\. High Court found that the conclusions arrived at by the Trial Court were not sustainable. After analyzing the evidence of PWs. 1, 2 and 5 it was held that the accusations have been established. Accordingly, the appellants were convicted for the offence punishable under Section 307 IPC and each was sentenced to undergo RI for four years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- with default stipulation.\n",
      "Paragraph 24: 5\\. In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Trial Court had rightly rejected the prosecution version taking note of the fact that evidence of 7 PWs 1, 2 and 5 are irreconcilable. It was also submitted that the evidence of PWs. 1, 2 and 5 is contradictory to each other.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: In any event, it was submitted that the injuries were on non- vital parts and, therefore, Section 307 IPC has no application.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, supported the judgment of the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: 6\\. PW3- the doctor attached to the Naguneri Government Hospital, Tenkasi examined PW 2 at about 8.15 a.m. on 3.10.1989. He issued the wound certificate ExP3. He found the following injuries on him:\n",
      "Paragraph 28: \"i. A bleeding lacerated wound 10cm x 5 cm. x 4cm on medical aspect of right forearm muscles and (NC) exposed.\n",
      "Paragraph 29: ii. A bleeding lacerated wound 3 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm in middle right forearm.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: iii. A lacerated bleeding wound in the palman aspect of 2 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm of right middle and index finger 8 seen and lacerated wound on the tip of right ring and little finger measuring 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm .\n",
      "Paragraph 31: iv. An incised wound 3 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm in upper aspect of right arm.\n",

      "Paragraph 37: 9 As per the wound certificate Ex.P3, injury No.3 and 9 is grievous in nature and the other injuries are simple injuries.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: 7\\. So far as the evidence of PWs. 1, 2 and 5 is concerned, it is clear that P.W.2 was indiscriminately attacked by Al and A2 with 'Aruval'. As a result of those injuries, the victim (P.W.2) fell on the ground.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: 8\\. According to P.W.5, as soon as P.W.2 fell on the ground, he became unconscious and thereafter, the accused persons ran away from the scene. This occurrence took place at about 7.30 A.M. and the victim was taken to the hospital at about 8.15 A.M. P.W.3 Doctor stated that the victim was conscious and the victim stated to him that the he was attacked by three persons with 'Aruval'.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: 9\\. P.W. 3 Doctor further stated that he gave Ex.P-2 intimation to the police, when P.W. 2 was admitted in the 10 hospital. On receipt of Ex.P-2, P.W.7 Head constable rushed to Nanguneri Government hospital. At that time, P.W.1 was present in the hospital and gave Ex. P-1 statement to P.W.7.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: 10\\. It is true that P.W.7 stated that he obtained Ex.P-1 complaint from P.W.1, when P.W.2 was unconscious. P.W.1 stated that when P.W.2 victim was taken to the hospital, he was in unconscious state and after admitting the victim in the hospital, P.W. 3 Doctor gave treatment to him. So, when treatment was being given by P.W.3 Doctor, P.W.7 came and at that time, he was informed by P.W. 1 that P.W. 2 was not in a position to give statement, since he was unconscious.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: 11\\. Even assuming that P.W.2 was conscious at that time, the nine serious injuries found on various parts of the body of the victim would clearly show that he could not have been able to give full details to P.W.7. Under those circumstances, obtaining of Ex. P-1 complaint from P.W. 1 is quite proper.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: 11\n",
      "Paragraph 44: 12\\. Merely because P.W.2 was conscious at that time, it cannot be said that the statement should not have been recorded from P.W.1 and the same is doubtful. No law prohibits the police officer from recording complaint relating to the occurrence, that too, from an eye witness. The ground of acquittal as recorded by trial Court is not at all a proper ground.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: 13\\. Secondly, accordingly to the trial court, P.W. 1 could not have been seen the occurrence.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: 14\\. This again is not the reasoning based on evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: According to both P.Ws. 1 and 2, they went to take bath in the well one after another. P.W.5 stated that after hearing the cry of P.W.2, P.W.1 and others came to the scene. This would not mean that P.W.1 did not accompany P.W.2. As a matter of fact, even according to P.W.5, P.Ws. 1 and 5 took the victim in a taxi to Naguneri Hospital.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: 12 15\\. The occurrence took place in a day light at 7.30 A.M.\n",

      "Paragraph 50: 1 could not have accompanied P.W.2 to take bath. Therefore, this ground of acquittal was rightly held by the High Court to be untenable.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: 16\\. We find that the analysis made by the High Court to set aside the order does not suffer from any infirmity. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that an appeal against the acquittal cannot be interfered by the Appellate Court except for the compelling reasons.\n",
      "Paragraph 52: 17\\. The appellants have questioned the correctness of the High Court's judgment. According to them, the High Court had not kept in view the parameters of appeal against acquittal. It is submitted that even if two views are possible, the view supporting the accused had to be accepted and since 13 the trial Court had precisely done it and there was no reason to interfere with the judgment of the trial Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 53: 18\\. In view of rival submissions of the parties, we think it proper to consider and clarify the legal position first. Chapter XXIX (Sections 372-394) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as \"the present Code\") deals with appeals. Section 372 expressly declares that no appeal shall lie from any judgment or order of a criminal court except as provided by the Code or by any other law for the time being in force. Section 373 provides for filing of appeals in certain cases. Section 374 allows appeals from convictions. Section 375 bars appeals in cases where the accused pleads guilty.\n",
      "Paragraph 54: Likewise, no appeal is maintainable in petty cases (Section 376).\n",
      "Paragraph 55: 19\\. Section 377 permits appeals by the State for enhancement of sentence. Section 378 confers power on the State to present an appeal to the High Court from an order of 14 acquittal. The said section is material and may be quoted in extenso:\n",
      "Paragraph 56: \"378\\. Appeal in case of acquittal :(1) Save as otherwise provided in sub- section (2) and subject to the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (5), 2 [(a) the District Magistrate may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an Appeal to the Court of Session from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence;\n",
      "Paragraph 57: (b) the State Government may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an Appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of an acquittal passed by any Court other than a High Court [not being an order under clause (a)] or an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Session in revision.\";].\n",
      "Paragraph 58: (2) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case in which the offence has been investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946) or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an offence under any Central Act other than this Code, 3 [the Central Government may, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), also direct the Public Prosecutor to present an Appeal-- 15 (a) to the Court of Session, from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence;\n",

      "Paragraph 60: (3) No Appeal under sub-section (1) or sub- section (2) shall be entertained except with the leave of the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 61: (4) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon complaint and the High Court, on an application made to it by the complainant in this behalf, grants special leave to Appeal from the order of acquittal, the complainant may present such an Appeal to the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 62: (5) No application under sub-section (4) for the grant of special leave to Appeal from an order of acquittal shall be entertained by the High Court after the expiry of six months, where the complainant is a public servant, and sixty days in every other case, computed from the date of that order of acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 63: (6) If, in any case, the application under sub- section (4) for the grant of special leave to Appeal from an order of acquittal is refused, no Appeal from that order of acquittal shall lie under sub- section (1) or under sub-section (2).\n",
      "Paragraph 64: 16\n",
      "Paragraph 65: 20\\. Whereas Sections 379-380 cover special cases of appeals, other sections lay down procedure to be followed by appellate courts.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: 21\\. It may be stated that more or less similar provisions were found in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter referred to as \"the old Code\") which came up for consideration before various High Courts, Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as also before this Court. Since in the present appeal, we have been called upon to decide the ambit and scope of the power of an appellate court in an appeal against an order of acquittal, we have confined ourselves to one aspect only i.e. an appeal against an order of acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: 22\\. Bare reading of Section 378 of the present Code (appeal in case of acquittal) quoted above, makes it clear that no restrictions have been imposed by the legislature on the powers of the appellate court in dealing with appeals against 17 acquittal. When such an appeal is filed, the High Court has full power to reappreciate, review and reconsider the evidence at large, the material on which the order of acquittal is founded and to reach its own conclusions on such evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: Both questions of fact and of law are open to determination by the High Court in an appeal against an order of acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: 23\\. It cannot, however, be forgotten that in case of acquittal, there is a double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person should be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved to be guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured an acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is certainly not weakened but reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: 24\\. Though the above principles are well established, a different note was struck in several decisions by various High 18 Courts and even by this Court. It is, therefore, appropriate if we consider some of the leading decisions on the point.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: 25\\. The first important decision was rendered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in [?CITATION?]. In Sheo Swarup the accused were acquitted by the trial court and the local Government directed the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from an order of acquittal under Section 417 of the old Code (similar to Section 378 of the present Code). At the time of hearing of appeal before the High Court, it was contended on behalf of the accused that in an appeal from an order of acquittal, it was not open to the appellate court to interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the trial Judge unless such findings could not have been reached by him had there not been some perversity or incompetence on his part. The High Court, however, declined to accept the said view. It held that no condition was imposed on the High Court in such appeal.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: It accordingly reviewed all the evidence in the case and having 19 formed an opinion of its weight and reliability different from that of the trial Judge, recorded an order of conviction. A petition was presented to His Majesty in Council for leave to appeal on the ground that conflicting views had been expressed by the High Courts in different parts of India upon the question whether in an appeal from an order of acquittal, an appellate court had the power to interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the trial Judge. Their Lordships thought it fit to clarify the legal position and accordingly upon the \"humble advice of their Lordships\", leave was granted by His Majesty. The case was, thereafter, argued. The Committee considered the scheme and interpreting Section 417 of the Code (old Code) observed that there was no indication in the Code of any limitation or restriction on the High Court in exercise of powers as an Appellate Tribunal. The Code also made no distinction as regards powers of the High Court in dealing with an appeal against acquittal and an appeal against conviction. Though several authorities were cited revealing different views by the High Courts dealing with an appeal from an order of acquittal, the Committee did not think it proper to 20 discuss all the cases.\n",
      "Paragraph 73: 26\\. Lord Russel summed up the legal position thus:\n",
      "Paragraph 74: \"There is, in their opinion, no foundation for the view, apparently supported by the judgments of some courts in India, that the High Court has no power or jurisdiction to reverse an order of acquittal on a matter of fact, except in cases in which the lower court has `obstinately blundered', or has `through incompetence, stupidity or perversity' reached such `distorted conclusions as to produce a positive miscarriage of justice', or has in some other way so conducted or misconducted itself as to produce a glaring miscarriage of justice, or has been tricked by the defence so as to produce a similar result.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 75: His Lordship, then proceeded to observe: (IA p.404) \"Sections 417, 418 and 423 of the Code give to the High Court full power to review at large the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded, and to reach the conclusion that upon that evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed. No limitation should be placed upon that power, unless it be found expressly stated in the Code.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 76: 21\n",
      "Paragraph 77: 27\\. The Committee, however, cautioned appellate courts and stated: (IA p.404) \"But in exercising the power conferred by the Code and before reaching its conclusions upon fact, the High Court should and will always give proper weight and consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt;\n",
      "Paragraph 78: and (4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses.\n",
      "Paragraph 79: To state this, however, is only to say that the High Court in its conduct of the appeal should and will act in accordance with rules and principles well known and recognised in the administration of justice.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 80: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 81: 28\\. In [?CITATION?], the Committee reiterated the above view in Sheo Swarup (Supra) and held that in an appeal against acquittal, the High Court has full powers to review and to reverse acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 82: 22\n",
      "Paragraph 83: 29\\. So far as this Court is concerned, probably the first decision on the point was [?CITATION?] (though the case was decided on 14-3-1950, it was reported only in 1954). In that case, the accused was acquitted by the trial court. The Provincial Government preferred an appeal which was allowed and the accused was convicted for offences punishable under Sections 302 and 323 IPC. The High Court, for convicting the accused, placed reliance on certain eyewitnesses.\n",
      "Paragraph 84: 30\\. Upholding the decision of the High Court and following the proposition of law in Sheo Swarup (supra), a six-Judge Bench held as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 85: \"6\\. It must be observed at the very outset that we cannot support the view which has been expressed in several cases that the High Court has no power under Section 417, Criminal Procedure Code, to reverse a judgment of acquittal, unless the judgment is perverse or the subordinate court has in some way or other misdirected itself so as to produce a miscarriage of justice.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 86: (emphasis supplied) 23\n",
      "Paragraph 87: 31\\. In [?CITATION?], a two-Judge Bench observed that it was well established that in an appeal under Section 417 of the (old) Code, the High Court had full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded. But it was equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused was further reinforced by his acquittal by the trial court, and the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence could be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons.\n",
      "Paragraph 88: 32\\. In [?CITATION?] the accused was acquitted by the trial court but was convicted by the High Court in an appeal against acquittal filed by the State. The aggrieved accused approached this Court. It was contended by him that there were \"no compelling reasons\" for setting aside the order of acquittal and due and proper weight had not been given by the High Court to the opinion of the 24 trial court as regards the credibility of witnesses seen and examined. It was also commented that the High Court committed an error of law in observing that \"when a strong `prima facie' case is made out against an accused person it is his duty to explain the circumstances appearing in evidence against him and he cannot take shelter behind the presumption of innocence and cannot state that the law entitles him to keep his lips sealed\".\n",
      "Paragraph 89: Upholding the contention, this Court said:\n",
      "Paragraph 90: \"We think this criticism is well founded. After an order of acquittal has been made the presumption of innocence is further reinforced by that order, and that being so, the trial court's decision can be reversed not on the ground that the accused had failed to explain the circumstances appearing against him but only for very substantial and compelling reasons.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 91: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 92: 33\\. In [?CITATION?] this Court said:\n",
      "Paragraph 93: 25 \"In our opinion, it is not correct to say that unless the appellate court in an appeal under Section 417, Criminal Procedure Code came to the conclusion that the judgment of acquittal under appeal was perverse it could not set aside that order.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: It has been laid down by this Court that it is open to the High Court on an appeal against an order of acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion, of course, keeping in view the well-established rule that the presumption of innocence of the accused is not weakened but strengthened by the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court which had the advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses whose evidence have been recorded in its presence.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: It is also well settled that the court of appeal has as wide powers of appreciation of evidence in an appeal against an order of acquittal as in the case of an appeal against an order of conviction, subject to the riders that the presumption of innocence with which the accused person starts in the trial court continues even up to the appellate stage and that the appellate court should attach due weight to the opinion of the trial court which recorded the order of acquittal.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: If the appellate court reviews the evidence, keeping those principles in mind, and comes to a contrary conclusion, the judgment cannot be said to have been vitiated.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 97: (emphasis supplied) 26\n",
      "Paragraph 98: 34\\. In [?CITATION?] the accused was prosecuted under Sections 302 and 447 IPC. He was acquitted by the trial court but convicted by the High Court. Dealing with the power of the High Court against an order of acquittal, Bose, J. speaking for the majority (2:1) stated: (AIR p. 220, para 1) \"It is, in our opinion, well settled that it is not enough for the High Court to take a different view of the evidence; there must also be substantial and compelling reasons for holding that the trial court was wrong.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 99: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 100: 35\\. In [?CITATION?], a three-Judge Bench considered almost all leading decisions on the point and observed that there was no difficulty in applying the principles laid down by the Privy Council and accepted by the Supreme Court. The Court, however, noted that appellate courts found considerable difficulty in understanding the scope of the words \"substantial and compelling reasons\" used in certain decisions. It was observed inter-alia as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 101: 27 \"This Court obviously did not and could not add a condition to Section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The words were intended to convey the idea that an appellate court not only shall bear in mind the principles laid down by the Privy Council but also must give its clear reasons for coming to the conclusion that the order of acquittal was wrong.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 102: The Court concluded as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 103: \"9\\. The foregoing discussion yields the following results: (1) an appellate court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded; (2) the principles laid down in Sheo Swarup case afford a correct guide for the appellate court's approach to a case in disposing of such an appeal; and (3) the different phraseology used in the judgments of this Court, such as, (i) `substantial and compelling reasons', (ii) `good and sufficiently cogent reasons', and (iii) `strong reasons' are not intended to curtail the undoubted power of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion; but in doing so it should not only consider every matter on record having a bearing on the questions of fact and the reasons given by the court below in support of its order of acquittal in its arriving at a conclusion on those facts, but should also express those reasons in its judgment, which lead it to hold that the acquittal was not justified.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 104: 28\n",
      "Paragraph 105: 36\\. Again, in [?CITATION?], the point was raised before a Constitution Bench of this Court. Taking note of earlier decisions, it was observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 106: \"17\\. In some of the earlier decisions of this Court, however, in emphasising the importance of adopting a cautious approach in dealing with appeals against acquittals, it was observed that the presumption of innocence is reinforced by the order of acquittal and so, `the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons': vide [?CITATION?]. Similarly in [?CITATION?], it was observed that the interference of the High Court in an appeal against the order of acquittal would be justified only if there are `very substantial and compelling reasons to do so'. In some other decisions, it has been stated that an order of acquittal can be reversed only for `good and sufficiently cogent reasons' or for `strong reasons'. In appreciating the effect of these observations, it must be remembered that these observations were not intended to lay down a rigid or inflexible rule which should govern the decision of the High Court in appeals against acquittals. They were not intended, and should not be read to have intended to introduce an additional condition in clause (a) of Section 423(1) of the Code. All that the said observations are intended to emphasize is that the approach of the High Court in dealing with an appeal against acquittal ought to be 29 cautious because as Lord Russell observed in Sheo Swarup the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused `is not certainly weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial'. Therefore, the test suggested by the expression `substantial and compelling reasons' should not be construed as a formula which has to be rigidly applied in every case. That is the effect of the recent decisions of this Court, for instance, in Sanwat Singh v. State of Rajasthan and [?CITATION?] and so, it is not necessary that before reversing a judgment of acquittal, the High Court must necessarily characterise the findings recorded therein as perverse.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 107: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 108: 37\\. Yet in another leading decision in [?CITATION?] this Court held that in India, there is no jurisdictional limitation on the powers of appellate court. \"In law there are no fetters on the plenary power of the appellate court to review the whole evidence on which the order of acquittal is founded and, indeed, it has a duty to scrutinise the probative material de novo, informed, however, by the weighty thought that the rebuttable innocence attributed to the accused having been converted into an acquittal the homage our jurisprudence 30 owes to individual liberty constrains the higher court not to upset the holding without very convincing reasons and comprehensive consideration.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 109: 38\\. Putting emphasis on balance between importance of individual liberty and evil of acquitting guilty persons, this Court observed as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 110: \"6\\. Even at this stage we may remind ourselves of a necessary social perspective in criminal cases which suffers from insufficient forensic appreciation. The dangers of exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt at the expense of social defence and to the soothing sentiment that all acquittals are always good regardless of justice to the victim and the community, demand especial emphasis in the contemporary context of escalating crime and escape. The judicial instrument has a public accountability. The cherished principles or golden thread of proof beyond reasonable doubt which runs thro' the web of our law should not be stretched morbidly to embrace every hunch, hesitancy and degree of doubt. The excessive solicitude reflected in the attitude that a thousand guilty men may go but one innocent martyr shall not suffer is a false dilemma. Only reasonable doubts belong to the accused.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: Otherwise any practical system of justice will then breakdown and lose credibility with the community. The evil of acquitting a guilty person 31 light-heartedly, as a learned author (Glanville Williams in Proof of Guilt) has saliently observed, goes much beyond the simple fact that just one guilty person has gone unpunished. If unmerited acquittals become general, they tend to lead to a cynical disregard of the law, and this in turn leads to a public demand for harsher legal presumptions against indicted `persons' and more severe punishment of those who are found guilty. Thus, too frequent acquittals of the guilty may lead to a ferocious penal law, eventually eroding the judicial protection of the guiltless.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: For all these reasons it is true to say, with Viscount Simon, that `a miscarriage of justice may arise from the acquittal of the guilty no less than from the conviction of the innocent....' In short, our jurisprudential enthusiasm for presumed innocence must be moderated by the pragmatic need to make criminal justice potent and realistic. A balance has to be struck between chasing chance possibilities as good enough to set the delinquent free and chopping the logic of preponderant probability to punish marginal innocents.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 113: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 114: 39\\. In [?CITATION?], the Court was considering the power of the High Court against an order of acquittal under Section 378 of the present Code. After considering the relevant decisions on the point it was stated as follows:\n",
      "Paragraph 115: 32 \"9\\. The principles are now well settled. At one time it was thought that an order of acquittal could be set aside for `substantial and compelling reasons' only and courts used to launch on a search to discover those `substantial and compelling reasons'. However, the `formulae' of `substantial and compelling reasons', `good and sufficiently cogent reasons' and `strong reasons' and the search for them were abandoned as a result of the pronouncement of this Court in [?CITATION?]. In Sanwat Singh case this Court harked back to the principles enunciated by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup v. R. Emperor and reaffirmed those principles. After Sanwat Singh v.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: State of Rajasthan this Court has consistently recognised the right of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion bearing in mind the considerations mentioned by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup case. Occasionally phrases like `manifestly illegal', `grossly unjust', have been used to describe the orders of acquittal which warrant interference. But, such expressions have been used more as flourishes of language, to emphasise the reluctance of the appellate court to interfere with an order of acquittal than to curtail the power of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion. In some cases ([?CITATION?][?CITATION?]), it has been said that to the principles laid down in Sanwat Singh case may be added the further principle that `if two reasonable conclusions can be reached on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should 33 not disturb the finding of the trial court'. This, of course, is not a new principle. It stems out of the fundamental principle of our criminal jurisprudence that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt. If two reasonably probable and evenly balanced views of the evidence are possible, one must necessarily concede the existence of a reasonable doubt. But, fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account. To entitle an accused person to the benefit of a doubt arising from the possibility of a duality of views, the possible view in favour of the accused must be as nearly reasonably probable as that against him. If the preponderance of probability is all one way, a bare possibility of another view will not entitle the accused to claim the benefit of any doubt. It is, therefore, essential that any view of the evidence in favour of the accused must be reasonable even as any doubt, the benefit of which an accused person may claim, must be reasonable.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 117: (emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Paragraph 118: 40\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court said:\n",
      "Paragraph 119: \"While sitting in judgment over an acquittal the appellate court is first required to seek an answer to the question whether the findings of the trial court are palpably wrong, manifestly erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable. If the appellate court answers the above question in the negative the order of acquittal is not to be 34 disturbed. Conversely, if the appellate court holds, for reasons to be recorded, that the order of acquittal cannot at all be sustained in view of any of the above infirmities it can then-and then only- reappraise the evidence to arrive at its own conclusions.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 120: 41\\. In [?CITATION?], referring to earlier decisions, the Court stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 121: \"7\\. The paramount consideration of the court should be to avoid miscarriage of justice. A miscarriage of justice which may arise from the acquittal of guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case where the trial court has taken a view based upon conjectures and hypothesis and not on the legal evidence, a duty is cast upon the High Court to reappreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes of ascertaining as to whether the accused has committed any offence or not.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: Probable view taken by the trial court which may not be disturbed in the appeal is such a view which is based upon legal and admissible evidence. Only because the accused has been acquitted by the trial court, cannot be made a basis to urge that the High Court under all circumstances should not disturb such a finding.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 123: 35\n",
      "Paragraph 124: 42\\. In [?CITATION?], the trial court acquitted the accused but the High Court convicted them. Negativing the contention of the appellants that the High Court could not have disturbed the findings of fact of the trial court even if that view was not correct, this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 125: \"7\\. We do not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellants that under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the High Court could not disturb the finding of facts of the trial court even if it found that the view taken by the trial court was not proper. On the basis of the pronouncements of this Court, the settled position of law regarding the powers of the High Court in an appeal against an order of acquittal is that the Court has full powers to review the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based and generally it will not interfere with the order of acquittal because by passing an order of acquittal the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is reinforced.\n",
      "Paragraph 126: The golden thread which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. Such is not a jurisdiction limitation on the appellate court but judge-made guidelines for circumspection. The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is avoided. A miscarriage of justice which may 36 arise from the acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case where the trial court has taken a view ignoring the admissible evidence, a duty is cast upon the High Court to reappreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes of ascertaining as to whether all or any of the accused has committed any offence or not\".\n",
      "Paragraph 127: 43\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court said:\n",
      "Paragraph 128: \"12\\. Doubtless the High Court in appeal either against an order of acquittal or conviction as a court of first appeal has full power to review the evidence to reach its own independent conclusion. However, it will not interfere with an order of acquittal lightly or merely because one other view is possible, because with the passing of an order of acquittal presumption of innocence in favour of the accused gets reinforced and strengthened. The High Court would not be justified to interfere with order of acquittal merely because it feels that sitting as a trial court it would have proceeded to record a conviction; a duty is cast on the High Court while reversing an order of acquittal to examine and discuss the reasons given by the trial court to acquit the accused and then to dispel those reasons. If the High Court fails to make such an exercise the judgment will suffer from serious infirmity.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 129: 37\n",
      "Paragraph 130: 44\\. In [?CITATION?], this Court observed:\n",
      "Paragraph 131: \"21\\. There is no embargo on the appellate court reviewing the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based. Generally, the order of acquittal shall not be interfered with because the presumption of innocence of the accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast upon the appellate court to reappreciate the evidence in a case where the accused has been acquitted, for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether any of the accused committed any offence or not\".\n",
      "Paragraph 132: 45\\. Again in [?CITATION?], this Court stated:\n",
      "Paragraph 133: \"8\\. While deciding an appeal against acquittal, the power of the appellate court is no less than 38 the power exercised while hearing appeals against conviction. In both types of appeals, the power exists to review the entire evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 134: However, one significant difference is that an order of acquittal will not be interfered with, by an appellate court, where the judgment of the trial court is based on evidence and the view taken is reasonable and plausible. It will not reverse the decision of the trial court merely because a different view is possible. The appellate court will also bear in mind that there is a presumption of innocence in favour of the accused and the accused is entitled to get the benefit of any doubt. Further if it decides to interfere, it should assign reasons for differing with the decision of the trial court.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 135: (emphasis supplied) 46\\. From the above decisions, in [?CITATION?], the following general principles regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal were culled out:\n",
      "Paragraph 136: (1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.\n",
      "Paragraph 137: 39 (2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law.\n",
      "Paragraph 138: (3) Various expressions, such as, \"substantial and compelling reasons\", \"good and sufficient grounds\", \"very strong circumstances\", \"distorted conclusions\", \"glaring mistakes\", etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature of \"flourishes of language\" to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: (4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed 40 to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court.\n",
      "Paragraph 140: (5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.\n",
      "Paragraph 141: 47\\. A person has, no doubt, a profound right not to be convicted of an offence which is not established by the evidential standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Though this standard is a higher standard, there is, however, no absolute standard. What degree of probability amounts to \"proof\" is an exercise particular to each case. Referring to the interdependence of evidence and the confirmation of one piece of evidence by another, a learned author says [see \"The Mathematics of Proof II\": Glanville Williams, Criminal Law Review, 1979, by Sweet and Maxwell, p.340 (342)]:\n",
      "Paragraph 142: 41 \"The simple multiplication rule does not apply if the separate pieces of evidence are dependent.\n",
      "Paragraph 143: Two events are dependent when they tend to occur together, and the evidence of such events may also be said to be dependent. In a criminal case, different pieces of evidence directed to establishing that the defendant did the prohibited act with the specified state of mind are generally dependent. A junior may feel doubt whether to credit an alleged confession, and doubt whether to infer guilt from the fact that the defendant fled from justice. But since it is generally guilty rather than innocent people who make confessions, and guilty rather than innocent people who run away, the two doubts are not to be multiplied together. The one piece of evidence may confirm the other.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 144: 48\\. Doubts would be called reasonable if they are free from a zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot afford any favourite other than truth. To constitute reasonable doubt, it must be free from an overemotional response. Doubts must be actual and substantial doubts as to the guilt of the accused persons arising from the evidence, or from the lack of it, as opposed to mere vague apprehensions. A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or a merely possible doubt, but a fair doubt 42 based upon reason and common sense. It must grow out of the evidence in the case.\n",
      "Paragraph 145: 49\\. The concepts of probability, and the degrees of it, cannot obviously be expressed in terms of units to be mathematically enumerated as to how many of such units constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt. There is an unmistakable subjective element in the evaluation of the degrees of probability and the quantum of proof. Forensic probability must, in the last analysis, rest on a robust common sense and, ultimately, on the trained intuitions of the Judge. While the protection given by the criminal process to the accused persons is not to be eroded, at the same time, uninformed legitimization of trivialities would make a mockery of administration of criminal justice. This position was illuminatingly stated by Venkatachaliah, J. (as His Lordship then was) in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 146: 43 50\\. The above position was highlighted in [?CITATION?] and in [?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 147: 51\\. When the factual position is analysed in the background of the conclusions arrived at by the High Court, the inevitable conclusion is that the High Court's judgment is correct. The appeal is dismissed. The appellants who are directed to be released on bail by order dated 10.12.2001, shall surrender to custody forthwith to serve the remainder of sentence.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: This group of appeals has been filed by various appellant-Associations questioning the correctness of the common impugned judgment and order dated 21.03.2007 passed in Letters Patent Appeal No. 690 of 2004 along with batch matters by the Delhi High Court in dismissing the appeals of the appellant/concerned workmen by issuing certain directions contained at para 20(a) of the said impugned judgment in affirming the judgment and order of learned single Judge in allowing the Writ Petitions filed by the respondent- Life Insurance Corporation of India (for short \"the Corporation\"). The appellant-Associations have filed these appeals urging various relevant facts and legal contentions with a prayer to restore the Award dated 18.06.2001 passed by the Central Government Industrial Tribunal, New Delhi (for short \"the CGIT\") in I.D. No.27 of 1991\\. The facts of the case are stated here under for the purpose of appreciating the factual and rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties with a view to ascertain whether the appellants/concerned workmen are entitled to the relief as prayed for in these appeals:- The concerned workmen are the members of the appellant-Associations, Federation of Employees Association, Workers Association and other concerned individual workmen who were working in the branches of the Corporation at various places in the country have raised the existing industrial dispute between the concerned workmen and the management of the Corporation regarding their absorption as regular and permanent service employees in their respective posts of the Corporation. The concerned workmen in all these appeals have been working as temporary, badli and part- time workmen claiming that they have been appointed by the management of the Corporation on daily wage basis against the leave vacancies and other vacancies of its employees in Class III and IV posts in various branch offices and Divisions of the Corporation. Their claim for regularisation were based on two Awards passed of the National Industrial Tribunal (for short 'the NIT') (i) the Award passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule on 17.04.1986 with regard to absorption of similarly placed workmen by the Corporation who had been working on temporary/badli/part-time basis in Class III and IV category posts in their respective branches of the Corporation and (ii)the Award passed by Justice S.M. Jamdar dated 26.08.1988, in pursuant to the reference made by the Ministry of Labour, Government of India, under Section 36A of the [Industrial Disputes Act, 1947] , where the NIT clarified and affirmed the Award dated 17.04.1986 passed by Justice R. D. Tulpule. The present dispute that arose between the concerned workmen and the Corporation was referred to the CGIT by the Ministry of Labour, Central Government, in exercise of its statutory power under Section 10(1)(d) read with Section 2A of the Act vide Order No. L-17011/107/90-IR-B(II) dated 04.03.1991 on the basis of the report of the Conciliation Officer for its adjudication on the following question :- \"Whether the action of the management of Life Insurance Corporation of India in not absorbing Badli/temporary and part time workmen employed in the establishment of LIC after 20.5.1985 is justified, if not, to what relief the workmen are entitled?\" The said industrial dispute has been raised by the Associations, Federation of workmen and concerned workmen in their individual capacity which was supported by the Unions and Associations of these workmen of the divisions and zones of the Corporation across India and workmen who have represented their case on individual basis. Apart from the said Unions, Associations, Federation of some of the workmen from Tamilnadu Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees Association and E. Prabhawati and Ors. had also been impleaded as parties in the dispute before the CGIT. E. Prabhawati and Ors. were impleaded vide order dated 01.12.1993 and The Tamil Nadu Terminated Temporary Full Time LIC Association was impleaded in the pending reference case vide order dated 06.04.1995. The Corporation is a creature of the Statute, namely, Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 (for short \"the LIC Act\"). Section 48 of the LIC Act enables the Central Government to make rules to carry out the performance of the Act by notification in the official gazette. Section 49(1) of the LIC Act empowers the Corporation to make regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of the LIC Act and the rules made there under provide for all matters for which provision is expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the LIC Act with the previous approval of the Central Government by notification in the gazette of India. Section 49(2) of the LIC Act lists certain matters for which Regulations may be made without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by sub-section (1). The LIC Act was amended by the Amendment Act 17 of 1957 with retrospective effect by incorporating sub-clause (bb) of sub-section 2 of Section 49 of the Amended Act, 1957 which was omitted later by Act 1 of 1981 (w.e.f. 31.1.1981) which provides for terms and conditions of service of the persons who have become employees of the Corporation under its Section 11 sub-Section (1) of the Act. By the authority vested in the Corporation under clause (bb) of sub-Section (2) of Section 49 of the amended Act, the Corporation framed Regulations defining the terms and conditions of service of the staff of the Corporation known as LIC of India (Staff) Regulations, 1960 (for short \"the Staff Regulations, 1960\") which was notified in the Gazette of India No. IV dated 23.7.1960 and came into force with effect from 1.7.1960. It is pertinent to note that although according to the Staff Regulations, 1960 there are only two types of employment that have been provided for in the Regulations (i) regular and (ii) temporary. The employment in the capacity of badlis, part-time is not provided thereunder. There is no specific nomenclature in the Staff Regulations, 1960, in this regard, but the said type of employment is prevalent in the Corporation both in the Center and also in various Divisions, Zonal offices throughout India. The concerned workmen have been continuously working in different capacities such as peons, hamals, watchman-cum-pump man, lift man, house attendants, sweepers, cleaners, assistant typist etc. on daily wage basis against permanent and other vacancies during that period. Between the years 1981-85, a large number of employees of Class III and IV posts were employed by the Corporation in the capacity of badlis, temporary and part-time workers. Their wage, conditions for the absorption into the regular cadre and other conditions of service were the subject matter of the Industrial Dispute. Thus, the reference was made in this regard to the National Industrial Tribunal as reference No. NTB-I of 1985. At the initial stage, the Western Zone Insurance Employees Association, Bombay and the Central Zone National Life Insurance Corporation Employees Association, Kanpur were the only parties to the reference besides the Corporation. Later on, all the Unions of all the Regions and the Zones in the country joined as parties and filed their respective claim statements before the NIT. During the course of said proceedings an interim Award was passed by the National Industrial Tribunal on the prayer of the workmen, restricting the Corporation from recruiting or absorbing any person in the posts without prior permission of the Tribunal. According to the interim Award passed by the NIT, the Corporation was restrained from making any new appointments except where persons had to be appointed over and above the then existing vacancies against which posts the badli, temporary or part- time workmen who had been working or had worked with the Corporation and those who would be concerned in the reference had to be appointed from amongst the badlis, temporary or part-time workmen against any vacancy continued, provided an undertaking is given to the Corporation by such workmen stating that no benefit would be claimed. After adjudication of the said Industrial Dispute between the parties, the Award was passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule on 17.4.1986. The said Award was based on the suggestions invited both from the workmen and from the management of the Corporation. The parties had given the mandate to the NIT to base its Award on any of the suggestions given by the parties after making necessary modifications. In the Award dated 17.04.1986, it was held that only those workmen who had worked in the Corporation during the period January 1, 1982 to May 20, 1985, the date of the reference was to be considered as eligible for absorption. The Award held that the workmen claiming absorption in Class III posts should have worked for 85 days in a period of two calendar years and the workman claiming absorption in Class IV post should have worked for 70 days in a period of three calendar years. It was further held by the NIT that the calculation of the number of days of work should be up to the date of reference. The Corporation was further directed to appoint a screening committee to consider suitability and desirability of such eligible workmen for their absorption in the posts of the Corporation. It was also directed by the NIT to the Corporation that the workmen considered to be suitable and desirable for the absorption should be absorbed against vacancies which existed in the Corporation as on 31.3.1985 and those which may arise subsequently. The Corporation was also directed not to recruit outsiders in a particular Division till such lists of workmen were exhausted. Directions given in the Award on the question of absorptions have been mentioned in paras 40 to 60 and 66 of the Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule. Aggrieved by the said Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule dated 17.4.1986, the Corporation filed Writ Petition No. 1801 of 1986 before the High Court of Judicature of Bombay challenging its legality. The Writ Petition of the Corporation was dismissed by the High Court vide order dated 14.8.1986, but at the same time, the High Court gave a certificate to the Corporation for seeking clarification of the said Award under Section 36A of the Act. In compliance with the Award dated 17.04.1986, the Corporation, while interpreting the Award with respect to the absorption of the workmen as recruitment, had issued six circulars commencing from 17.9.1986 to 25.2.1987. The Workers Union and Associations disputed the aforesaid instructions issued by the Corporation. Therefore, an Industrial Dispute was raised once again. The Central Government in the Ministry of Labour made a reference under Section 36A of the Act to the NIT being presided over by Justice S.M. Jamdar and the same was registered as NTB(1) of 1987, which reads thus :- \"Can the Award dated 17.4.1986 with special reference to paragraphs 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, 64 and 66 and the interim order dated 14.3.1986 be interpreted to mean that the Central Office of the Life Insurance Corporation of India is empowered to issue instructions/guidelines as contained in their circular issued in this behalf to implement the directions of the Award. If not, what could be the correct interpretation of various directions covered by the said paragraphs in the circumstances of the case. Whether the term \"absorption\" referred to at various places in the Award can be interpreted in mean \"recruitment\". During the course of the hearing of the said reference, an interim order was passed by the NIT restraining the Corporation to make any recruitment from the open market during the pendency of the proceedings. The NIT, after hearing the parties and examining the points of dispute, answered the term of reference and gave its own interpretation of the earlier Award passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule holding that the observations contemplated by the earlier Award did not mean recruitment. An Award dated 26.8.1988 was passed accordingly by Justice S.M. Jamdar clarifying the Award passed by Justice Tulpule that absorption of workmen does not mean recruitment. Aggrieved by the said Award, the Corporation preferred SLP No. 14906 of 1988 titled The Management of Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Their Workmen before this Court urging various legal contentions. It is the case of the Corporation that during the course of the said SLP, a compromise was entered into between the Corporation and 8 out of the 9 Unions of the above SLP. Accordingly, this Court passed an order dated 1.3.1989 on the basis of the said compromise. The terms and conditions of the said compromise between the parties therein will be extracted in the reasoning portion of this Judgment. In pursuant to the said compromise between the parties in the SLP, as directed by this Court, the Corporation gave appointments to a large number of such workmen working on temporary, badli and part-time basis to the posts in the Class III as well as Class IV in various Divisions of the Corporation. The said appointments were given to the persons recruited on temporary basis between 1.1.1982 to 20.5.1985. Thereafter, the employees who were employed as temporary, badli and part-time workers after 20.5.1985 raised the demand for their absorption and regularisation of their service as permanent employees. When their demands were not accepted by the Corporation, several writ petitions in this respect were filed before the High Court of Madras between the years 1989 to 1991. The writ petition No. 10367 of 1989 filed between the Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Welfare Association and Senior Divisional Manager, LIC, Khanjawar, along with 18 other writ petitions were listed for hearing before the full bench of the High Court of Madras. After hearing the parties of all the writ petitions, the High Court dismissed the same which decision is reported in 1993 (1) LLJ 1030. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, SLP (C) Nos. 10393-10413 of 1992 titled E. Prabhawati and Ors. v. LIC of India & Ors. were filed before this Court. In the said SLPs, on the direction of this Court, the Corporation framed a Scheme for the regularization of the employees in their service who were granted ad- hoc appointments for 85 days at intervals from time to time and placed the same before this Court. After hearing the parties, this Court by means of an interim order dated 23.1.1992 found the Scheme to be reasonable and approved clauses (a) to (d) of paragraph 1 of the said Scheme and the Corporation was directed to proceed to regularize the employees eligible in their service in accordance with the said Scheme. It is also pertinent to note that during the pendency of the writ petitions before the High Court of Madras, the industrial dispute that arose between the concerned workmen and the Corporation in these appeals were referred to the CGIT by the Ministry of Labour vide order dated 4.3.1991. Further, during the continuance of the proceedings of the present reference E. Prabhawati and Ors. their impleadment application was allowed vide order dated 1.12.1993. However, they did not implead in the above dispute proceedings. Thereafter, G. Sudhakar and Ors. (similarly placed employees) approached the High Court of Andhra Pradesh seeking relief for the absorption in their employment of the Corporation in the Divisions where they were working. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh after hearing the parties gave directions to the Corporation to frame a Scheme on par with the E. Prabhavathy Scheme for regularisation of such workmen. Aggrieved by the said order, the Corporation filed C.A. No. 2104 of 2000 titled [?CITATION?] before this Court which was disposed of by observing that the Scheme as has been passed in the case of E. Prabhavati & Ors. case (supra) will also be applicable to the case of G. Sudhakar and Ors. The CGIT conducted an inquiry to answer the points of disputes arising from the industrial dispute raised by the concerned workmen in this case. The CGIT on the basis of the pleadings, evidence on record and also on the basis of the Award passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule which was clarified in the Award passed by Justice S.M. Jamdar referred to supra, held that the same are applicable to the concerned workmen in this dispute. Accordingly, the CGIT passed an Award dated 18.06.2001 in terms of Justice R.D. Tulpule and Justice S.M. Jamdar, giving directions to the Corporation for their absorption in their respective posts. The Corporation being aggrieved by the Award passed by the CGIT filed Civil Writ Petition No. 4346 of 2001 before the Delhi High Court placing strong reliance upon the order passed by this Court wherein it accepted the terms and conditions of the compromise arrived at between the parties in the The Management of Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Their Workmen (SLP No 14906 of 1988) referred to supra which was filed by the Corporation against the Awards of the NIT by Justice R.D. Tulpule and Justice S.M. Jamdar Awards. Further, reliance was placed on E. Prabhavati & Ors. case (supra) which was disposed of as per the Scheme worked out by the Corporation pursuant to the orders of this Court in that case. The said Scheme was as per the decision in the case of State of Haryana & Ors. v. Piara Singh & Ors. wherein, this Court indicated how regularisation of ad- hoc/temporary employees in the Government and Public Sector Undertakings should be effected. Thereafter, the case of G. Sudhakar & others (supra) was also disposed of as per terms in the E. Prabhavathi Scheme. Further, it was contended by the Corporation before the learned single Judge of the High Court that the CGIT without accepting the said order/Scheme which is binding upon it under Article 141 of the Constitution of India has erroneously answered the points of dispute in favour of the concerned workmen. The said contention of the Corporation was opposed by the Association, Unions, the Federation and concerned workmen involved in these appeals. The learned single Judge accepted the contention raised by the Corporation by relying on decisions rendered by this Court in the case of E. Prabhavathy & Ors. (supra) and G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra) and thereafter, held that on plain reading of the above said decisions of this Court, the term of reference before the CGIT stood answered when this Court decided E. Prabhavathy & Ors. (supra), which again was concluded and reiterated in the decision of this Court in G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra). Consequently, the Award passed by the CGIT in relation to the concerned workmen of these appeals was set aside by the learned single Judge by assigning his reasons in judgment and order passed by him. Aggrieved by the Judgment and order passed by the learned single Judge of the High Court, the concerned workmen challenged the same by filing L.P.A. No. 690 of 2004 and other connected appeals before the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court inter alia urging that the findings and reasons recorded by the learned single Judge in his judgment are not only erroneous in law but also suffer from error in law as the learned single Judge has accepted the binding settlement between the Corporation and the similarly placed workmen. It was further contended that Section 18 (3) and Section 19 (3) & (6) of the Act were not properly examined keeping in mind that the said settlement arose out of the Awards of the NIT being challenged before this Court in SLP No. 14906 of 1988, however this Court at no point set aside the NIT Awards in spite of the compromise arrived at between the parties therein, therefore, the learned single Judge failed to consider that the said Awards were still binding upon the Corporation. Therefore, it was contended by the concerned workmen before the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi that the learned single Judge was not right in setting aside the Award passed by the CGIT in favour of the concerned workmen involved in these appeals and prayed for setting aside the same by allowing the Letters Patent Appeals. The Division Bench of High Court of Delhi examined the points of dispute arising out of the Industrial Disputes raised by the workmen of the Corporation, facts and rival legal contentions and the correctness of the finding recorded by the learned single Judge in setting aside the Award of the CGIT. It was held by the Division Bench that the appointment letters issued to the various employees specifically stipulated that their appointments are temporary for a specified period and the same would be terminated on the expiry or the period specified therein and that during the period of the temporary appointment none of the provisions of the LIC (Staff) Regulations, 1960 would apply. It was further held that the appellants had accepted the aforesaid terms of appointment and therefore, they cannot raise a claim for their regularisation or automatic absorption in the permanent posts. It was further held that this Court in the decisions of E. Prabhavathy & Ors. and G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra) also declined regularisation of workmen and directed the Corporation for conducting selection process for regular appointment and that none of the appellants as on the date of raising of the industrial dispute were continuing in their respective posts as their services stood terminated on the expiry of the tenure of their temporary employment and even if they had continued to serve it was because of orders passed by various courts. It was further held by the Division Bench that the reliance placed on paragraph 53 of the Secretary, [?CITATION?] by the appellants was misplaced as the ratio laid down in the said case is not applicable to the facts of the present case under any circumstance. It was further held that in the present cases, there is a specific rule which provides as to how recruitment has to be made to the vacant posts on regular basis, and the workmen herein were recruited under different set of instructions altogether which were meant for engagement of workmen on temporary basis and permit recruitment of temporary staff who would not be entitled for absorption in the posts of Class III and IV of the Corporation. Therefore, the Division Bench held that none of the cases of the appellants would attract for issuance of the direction to the Corporation to absorb them automatically in their posts and dismissed the Letter Patent Appeals filed by the concerned workmen. Hence, the present appeals urging various legal grounds. The correctness of the said findings of the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench are challenged by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the concerned workmen in these appeals inter alia, contending that the Award of the CGIT passed after adjudication of points of dispute was in relation to the concerned workmen who have been appointed by the Corporation as temporary, badli and part-time workmen after 20.5.1985. These workmen have been appointed by following the procedure under the LIC (Staff) Regulations issued by the Corporation from time to time and they have been discharging permanent nature of work against permanent and regular vacancies as temporary, badli and part-time workmen in the various offices, Zones and Divisions of the Corporation across India. Further, it is contended that the Awards passed by the NIT by Justice R.D. Tulpule, the same being clarified and affirmed by Justice S.M. Jamdar vide reference under Section 36A of the Act, were passed after determination of the points of dispute in relation to the industrial dispute raised by similarly placed workmen of the Corporation who were appointed and had been working on such permanent and regular posts on temporary, badli and part-time basis in Class III and IV categories of employees of the Corporation between 01.01.1982 to 20.05.1985. Therefore, the NIT Awards clarified that those similarly placed workmen were entitled for absorption in terms of the direction given in the Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule which was clarified subsequently by the Award passed in 1988 by Justice S. M. Jamdar. Of course, the said Awards by the NIT were challenged before this Court in the SLP No. 14906 of 1988 at the end of which eight out of nine unions therein entered into a compromise with the Corporation and the same was permitted by this Court by way of an interim measure without any prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of the other Union who had not entered into such compromise. Accordingly, the said SLP was disposed of by this Court vide order dated 01.3.1989. Further, it is contended by the learned counsel that the CGIT has rightly placed reliance upon the terms and conditions of the Awards of Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar. Though the said Awards were challenged before this Court and the matter was disposed of in terms of the compromise arrived at between the parties therein, the NIT Awards were not set aside or terminated by the Corporation or by any other Award or order passed by NIT or any other Court. Hence, the same will be operative and binding between the parties under Section 18(3)(d) read with Section 19 sub-section(3) & (6) of the Act. In support of their contention, reliance was placed upon the decision of [?CITATION?] It is also contended by Mr. Shekhar Naphade, learned amicus curiae on behalf of the workmen that the industrial dispute was raised under the provision of Section 2(k) read with Section 10 and 12 of the Act by the concerned workmen who have been working as temporary, badli and part-time workmen in the posts of Class III and Class IV of the Corporation for their absorption in the permanent posts. The said claim of the concerned workmen was disputed by the Corporation; the Central Government referred the existing industrial dispute to the CGIT for adjudication of the points of dispute as it has got the jurisdiction to adjudicate the said industrial dispute. He placed strong reliance upon Schedule IV of the Act and invited our attention to Item No. 6 in Schedule II under which matters other than those specified in the III Schedule are within the jurisdiction of the Labour Court and also Item No. 11 of Schedule IV which provides for Conditions of Service for Change of which Notice is to be given by the Corporation in case of any increase or reduction (other than casual) in the number of persons employed or to be employed in any occupation or process or department or shift, [not occasioned by the circumstances over which the employer has no control]. Since the Corporation is a Statutory Body which has come into existence under the LIC Act, 1956, it is required to follow the provisions of the Act with regard to service conditions of the workmen, including better service conditions, absorption, regularisation etc. He has also placed reliance upon the Item No. 10 of V Schedule to the Act, wherein it states that it is an unfair labour practice on the part of the employer to employ workmen as \"badlis\", casuals or temporaries and continue them as such for years, with the object of depriving them of the status and privileges of permanent workmen and the same is prohibited under Section 25T of the Act. Further, strong reliance was placed by him upon the provisions under Section 25T and 25U under Chapter VC of the Act, with regard to the Unfair Labour Practices on the part of the employer wherein it is stated that an employee or a workman and Trade Union shall not commit any unfair labour practice in relation to the matter as enumerated in the V Schedule referred to supra and further Section 25U of the Act contemplates that any person either employer or Trade Unions of Employers who commits unfair labour practice as enumerated in the V schedule shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to Rs.1,000/- or both. Therefore, it is contended that in the case on hand, the workmen concerned have been employed on temporary, badli and part- time basis for several years, depriving them of the privileges of permanent workmen which is a clear case of unfair labour practice on the part of the Corporation under Item 10 Schedule V, which is prohibited under Section 25T of the Act and the Corporation would be liable for penalty under Section 25U of the Act. Therefore, the CGIT has got ample power to adjudicate the existing industrial dispute between the parties on the basis of the points of dispute referred to it with respect to the claim raised by the concerned workmen. Further, in justification of the Awards passed by the NIT in giving direction to the Corporation to absorb similarly situated workmen from 01.01.1982 till 20.05.1985, strong reliance was placed by him upon the case of [?CITATION?] wherein, this Court discussed the powers of Industrial Tribunal to override the contracts. Therefore, the aforesaid Awards passed by the NIT are binding between the parties under Section 18(3) of the Act. The Awards passed by the NIT in a similar dispute are still operative as the same are not terminated by either of the parties as provided under Section 19(6) of the Act, even after the expiry of the period of operation under Section 19(3) of the Act, & therefore, the Awards shall continue to be operative & binding on the parties until a period of two months has elapsed from the date on which notice is given by the Corporation intimating its intention to terminate the Awards. He further contended that in the case on hand, no such notice is issued by either of the parties and therefore the Awards are operative and binding in law upon the parties. The aforesaid contentions, are rebutted by the learned senior counsel Mr. Kailash Vasdev, appearing on behalf of the Corporation, placing strong reliance on a series of judgments of this Court to show that the compromise was entered into between the Corporation and 99% of the employees on behalf of the workmen involved in the SLP 14906 of 1988 filed by the Corporation questioning the correctness of the Awards passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule and Justice S.M. Jamdar. Therefore, the said compromise is binding between the parties as provided under Section 18(3) of the Act. Further, he has urged that the case of D. J. Bahadur (supra), upon which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the appellants, is sought to be distinguished by him by relying on paragraphs 43 and 47 of the said judgment in support of the case of the Corporation contending that the said decision does not render any assistance to the workmen in these appeals. He placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in the case of [?CITATION?],[?CITATION?],[?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] to contend that the said Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule and clarified by Justice S.M. Jamdar Award are replaced and merged with the compromise arrived at between the parties before this Court in SLP 14906 of 1988, and the said compromise is binding on the Corporation and the parties to the compromise that Awards are not in operation, therefore, the CGIT has erred in placing reliance upon the same to grant relief in favour of the workmen which has been rightly set aside by the High Court. It is further contended by him that in the SLP filed against the judgment of full Bench of the High Court of Madras by E. Prabhavati and Ors., wherein, the Scheme was framed by the Corporation in these cases on the direction of this Court, which was accepted by the parties and the Special Leave Petition was disposed of in the aforesaid terms by this Court by its order dated 23.10.1992. Further, it is contended that thereafter, the decision of the High Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh in the Writ Petition filed by G. Sudhakar and Ors. (supra) was also challenged by the Corporation before this Court and disposed of in the same in terms of the Scheme as in E. Prabhavathy & Ors.(supra) case. Further, it is submitted that the Award of absorption of the concerned workmen passed by the CGIT has been rightly set aside by the learned single Judge and the said decision of the learned single Judge has been rightly affirmed in the judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court by giving cogent and valid reasons and therefore, the same does not call for interference by this Court in exercise of its Appellate Jurisdiction. In view of the factual and rival legal contentions urged by the learned counsel on behalf of the parties and the amicus curiae, we have to answer the same by recording our reasons as to (i) whether the setting aside of the Award passed by the CGIT by the learned single Judge by placing reliance upon compromise reached between the parties in SLP No.14906 of 1988, which was filed against the Award of Justice Tulpule, which Award was clarified and affirmed by Justice S.M. Jamdar is justified, legal and valid?, (ii) whether the judgment and order of the learned single Judge being affirmed by the Division Bench of High Court in its judgment is legal and valid? and (iii) what Award/Order the appellants are entitled to in law? We answer point (i) and (ii) together as the same are interrelated by assigning the following reasons- Undisputedly, the concerned workmen in the above references before the CGIT have been working in different offices and Zones, Divisional offices of the Corporation in various posts namely peons, hamals, watchman-cum-pump man, lift man, house attendants, sweepers, cleaners, assistant typist etc in different parts of the country who were appointed by following the Rules and Instructions of the Corporation which were relevant at that point of time. The concerned workmen in industrial dispute referred to the CGIT have been discharging perennial nature of work against the regular permanent posts in the Corporation. The industrial dispute raised by similarly placed workmen, who were appointed between the period 01.01.1982 till 20.05.1985 was adjudicated on the points of dispute by the NIT with regard to the justification of absorption of the said workmen as permanent workmen in their respective posts by Justice R.D. Tulpule. The relevant portion of the Award is extracted as under for better appreciation of rival legal submissions made by the learned counsel on behalf of the parties with a view to examine the correctness of the findings recorded by the High Court:- \"65\\. In the light of the directions above with regard to observation and creation of additional post by the Corporation I do not think that there would be any occasion in future for the corporation to employ workman in the temporary and badlee categories existing for the occasional and temporary increase in work which necessitate employment of temporary staff in all probability would be only amongst class III cadre, in which case there could be no occasion and there need not be I think any case or situation require consideration or grant of any other benefit apart from the wage to such workman. 66.I hope and expect that in the light of what has been said and a past exercise of the corporation situation where a large number of such employees could be engaged without adherence to any formalities or procedures by the various local managements would be completely eliminated and done away with and this kind of employment in the corporation history would be the last occasion. Excepting the temporary employment the corporation will have no occasion or necessity to employ badly workmen it is hoped in future. Though part time employees will continue to be in existence for some more time as I have indicated, the corporation will also see its own way to absorb the part time employees in its regular employment as far as possible and reduce the number of part time employees to the minimum however, whenever, hereafter any occasion or vacancy arises of regular employment in part time categories and employment, then those who have worked part time in accordance with their seniority should be given preference for absorption in the regular cadre of the Corporation's employment. This should be irrespective of the qualifying age for the entry into corporation's service qualification but subject to his being found suitable.\" Upon the reference under Section 36A of the Act being made by the Ministry of Labour to Justice S. M. Jamdar to clarify the Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule, it was held that the Award of Justice Tulpule was very clear as the same directs only for the absorption of the workmen concerned in the said dispute in the various offices, Divisions and Zones throughout the country. Therefore, it does not amount to recruitment. Aggrieved by the said Award, the Corporation had filed SLP No. 14906 of 1988 before this Court urging various grounds. In the said SLP, this Court in its order dated 1.3.1989 has observed that eight out of the nine workmen Unions said to be representing about 99% of the workers have entered into a compromise with the management of the Corporation. This Court further in the course of the order has observed and permitted the management of the Corporation and the said eight Unions to implement the said compromise by way of an interim measure without any prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of the other Union, who have not entered into such compromise with the Corporation. The relevant terms and conditions of the compromise read thus :- \"The Management agrees to consider the temporary/part-tim/badli workmen employed by the petitioner for 85 days in an two years in a Class III post and for 70 days in any three years in a Class IV post in any of its establishments during the period 1.1.82 to 20.5.85, for regular employment on the basis and in the manner stated hereinbeloe. ... the selection of the candidate shall be made on the basis of the folloing qualifications, age, test, interview and also having regard to the number of days worked by the candidates. A panel of selected candidates shall be made and the selected candidates shall be appointed in regular employment from the pane in the order of merit propectivity from the dates to be notifdies and when vacancies in sanctioned posts for regular employment are filled from time to time\" Pursuant to the above compromise, this Court passed the following order in SLP No. 14906 of 1988 on 1.3.1989 :- \"Special leave is granted. It appears that out of nine Unions eight Unions said to be representing about 99% of the workers have entered into a compromise with the Management. In the circumstances pending the final disposal of the appeal, we permit the Management and the members of the said eight Unions to implement the terms of compromise by way of interim measure without however, any prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of the other Union, who have not entered into such compromise with the management.\" (emphasis laid by this Court) 25\\. From the perusal of the above order of this Court in SLP 14906 of 1988, nowhere it has been stated in the terms of the compromise between the parties that the Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule which was clarified upon reference made by the Central Government under Section 36A of the Act by Justice Jamdar, is either set aside by this Court or substituted the compromise terms in the place of the Award except the order referred to supra passed in the above SLP 14906 of 1988. In fact, on the other hand it is clearly stated that the compromise terms are between the parties to the said SLP and that it shall not prejudice the respective rights and obligations in relation to the members of the other union. Therefore, the effect of the Award of Justice R. D. Tulpule with regard to the direction given to the Corporation regarding absorption of badli, temporary employees as permanent employees has not been substituted by terms and conditions of the compromise. The Award of Justice R.D. Tulpule reiterated by way of clarification in the Award passed by Justice Jamdar in the dispute subsequently has been operative even after the compromise arrived at between the parties to the compromise in the SLP No.14906 of 1988 before this Court. Therefore, the contention of the learned senior counsel on behalf of the Corporation that the said Awards are not in operation and that only the terms and conditions of compromise and orders of this Court are binding upon the concerned workmen in these appeals is not both factually and legally correct. This above said argument of the learned senior counsel on behalf of the Corporation is not tenable in view of the categorical statement made by this Court in its orders passed in SLP referred to supra, wherein, this Court has permitted the management and members of the said 8 Unions to implement the terms of compromise by way of interim measure without any prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of other Union who have not entered into compromise with the management of the Corporation. It is not the case of the Corporation in these appeals either before the CGIT or before the High Court or in these proceedings the concerned workmen have also accepted the said terms and conditions of the compromise arrived between the parties in the SLP No. 14906 of 1988. This Court in the order passed in the above said SLP which is extracted hereinabove has made it very clear that the said compromise entered into between unions therein, but it does not prejudice the rights and contentions of the concerned workmen whose disputes are in relation to their absorption in their respective posts who were appointed after 20.05.1985. Further, even if some of the workmen are bound under the said compromise that arose out of SLP No. 14906 of 1988, this in no way deters their right to raise the industrial dispute and get the same adjudicated vide order of reference by the appropriate Government to the CGIT. The Award of the CGIT was concluded after rightly examining the facts, circumstances of the case and the legal principles laid down in the Awards passed by Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar. More importantly the CGIT Award was passed after rightly appreciating the points of dispute referred to it and on the merits of the case. Furthermore, as per the legal principle laid down by this Court in the case of Bharat Bank (supra), the Industrial Court while adjudicating an industrial dispute has the right to override contracts and create rights which are opposed to contractual rights. The CGIT has rightly adjudicated the industrial dispute referred to it by the Central Government at the instance of the concerned workmen on the points of dispute, on the basis of pleadings and evidence on record and legal principles laid down in the Awards passed by the NIT. The relevant para from the above said case upon which the learned amicus curiae has rightly placed reliance reads thus:- \"9\\. The first contention is that the Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to perform a judicial or quasi- judicial function, since it is not required to be guided by any recognized substantive law in deciding disputes which come before it. On the other hand, in deciding industrial disputes, it has to override contracts and create rights which are opposed to contractual rights. In these circumstances, it is said that the very questions which arose before the Privy Council in [?CITATION?] arise in this case, these questions being: (1) How can the propriety of the Tribunal's decision be tested on appeal, and (2) What are the canons by which the appellate court is to be guided in deciding the appeal? Their Lordships of the Privy Council undoubtedly felt that these were serious questions, but they had no hesitation in saying that \"if it were clear that appeals ought to be allowed, such difficulties would doubtless be met somehow\". This, in my opinion, is a sufficient answer to the difficulty raised. The Tribunal has to adjudicate in accordance with the provisions of the [Industrial Disputes Act] . It may sometimes override contracts, but so can a court which has to administer law according to the Bengal or Bihar Money-lenders Act, Encumbered Estates Act and other similar Acts. The Tribunal has to observe the provisions of the special law which it has to administer though that law may be different from the law which an ordinary court of justice administers. The appellate court, therefore, can at least see that the rules according to which it has to act and the provisions which are binding upon it are observed, and its powers are not exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner. ........ 61\\. We would not examine the process by which an Industrial Tribunal comes to its decisions and I have no hesitation in holding that the process employed is not judicial process at all. In settling the disputes between the employers and the workmen, the function of the Tribunal is not confined to administration of justice in accordance with law. It can confer rights and privileges on either party which it considers reasonable and proper, though they may not be within the terms of any existing agreement. It has not merely to interpret or give effect to the contractual rights and obligations of the parties. It can create new rights and obligations between them which it considers essential for keeping industrial peace..... The Tribunal is not bound by the rigid rules of law. The process it employees is rather an extended form of the process of collective bargaining and is more akin to administrative than to judicial function. In describing the true position of an Industrial Tribunal in dealing with labour disputes, this Court in [?CITATION?] quoted with approval a passage from Ludwig Teller's well known work on the subject, where the learned author observes that \"industrial arbitration may involve the extension of an existing agreement or the making of a new one or in general the creation of new obligations or modification of old ones, while commercial arbitration generally concerns itself with interpretation of existing obligations and disputes relating to existing agreements.\" The views expressed in these observations were adopted in its entirety by this Court. Our conclusion, therefore, is that an Industrial Tribunal formed under the [Industrial Disputes Act]  is not a judicial tribunal and its determination is not a judicial determination in the proper sense of these expressions.\" (emphasis laid by this Court) Therefore, keeping in mind this principle laid down by this Court in the above referred case, we are of the view that the CGIT has rightly overridden the compromise arising out of SLP No. 14906 of 1988 and passed the Award in favour of the concerned workmen. Further, with respect to the E. Prabhavathy case referred to supra, which was filed before this Court, on preliminary hearing of the said case, this Court directed the Corporation to frame a Scheme for regularisation of those employees who were granted ad hoc appointment for 85 days at intervals from time to time. In accordance with the same, a Scheme was framed as per the decision of this Court in the case of State of Haryana v. Piara Singh (supra). The relevant portion of the Scheme is extracted hereunder: \"(a) All those temporary employees who have worked for 85 days in any two consecutive calendar years with the Life Insurance Corporation between 20.5.1985 uptill date and who confronted to the required eligibility criteria for regular recruitment on the dates of their initial temporary appointment will be permitted to compete for the next regular recruitment to be made by the Life Insurance Corporation after the regular recruitment for these posts currently scheduled for November, 1992; (b) These candidates will be considered on their merits with all other candidates who may apply for such appointments, including those from the open market. (c) These candidates will be given an age relaxation for applying for regular recruitment provided that they were eligible on the date of their first temporary appointment for securing regular appointment with the Life Insurance Corporation. (d) If these candidates are otherwise eligible, they can apply for regular recruitment in the normal course.\" Thereafter, this Court granted leave and disposed of the Civil Appeals incorporating the essential features of the Scheme as a part of its order. Further, this Court opined that the said Scheme was also applicable to the case of G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra) and passed an order accordingly and disposed of that case also. The learned senior counsel for the respondents has made his endeavour by taking us through the said scheme which was framed on the basis of the decision of this Court in the case of Piara Singh's case (supra) and that the same was prevalent in 1992. It is pertinent to note that the said Scheme framed in the E. Prabhavathy case (supra) was the outcome of the order passed in Writ Petition filed by the concerned workmen in those cases and not the adjudication of the industrial dispute as per points of dispute referred to the CGIT/NIT by the Appropriate Government as per Section 10 of the Act. Therefore, placing reliance on the above Scheme by the learned senior counsel on behalf of the Corporation in justification of the impugned judgment and order of the High Court and the said Scheme formulated by the Corporation being accepted by the workmen in those proceedings does not in any way take away the statutory and fundamental rights of the concerned workmen in these appeals, who have raised the industrial dispute for their absorption into regular permanent posts of Class III and Class IV of the Corporation. Further, by a careful reading of the said order in the SLP No. 14906 of 1988, it has been made clear that the Awards passed by the NIT (by Justice Jamdar and Justice Tulpule) after adjudicating the points of dispute in the industrail dispute raised by similarly placed workmen is not disturbed by substituting the terms and conditions of compromise between the parties therein in SLP No.14906 of 1988. Therefore, the Awards in relation to the absorption of the workmen as permanent workmen in the Corporation have got statutory force. This is what is stated by the CGIT in its Award on the basis of pleadings and evidence on record, which was erroneously set aside by the High Court by assigning erroneous reasons which is sought to be justified by the senior counsel on behalf of the Corporation by placing reliance upon the orders and Scheme framed in E. Prabhavathy & Ors. and G. Sudhakar & Ors. cases which scheme has no application to the case of the concerned workmen involved in these appeals referred to supra. Therefore, the learned amicus curiae Mr. Naphade has rightly placed reliance upon the decision of this Court in the case of D. J. Bahadur (supra) to substantiate his legal contention that the Awards passed by Justice R.D. Tulpule and reiterated by Justice Jamdar by clarifying the same in the reference under Section 36A of the Act are still binding upon the parties as the same have neither been set aside nor terminated by either of the parties or orders of this Court or Scheme framed by the Corporation. The relevant paragraphs of the above said case are extracted hereunder: \"138\\. The court then proceeded to consider specifically the situation that would obtain in the 3rd period in relation to an award and held: \"Quite apart from this, however, it appears to us that even if an award has ceased to be in operation or in force and has ceased to be binding on the parties under the provisions of Section 19(6) it will continue to have its effect as a contract between the parties that has been made by industrial adjudication in place of the old contract. So long as the award remains in operation under Section 19(3), Section 23(c) stands in the way of any strike by the workmen and lock-out by the employer in respect of any matter covered by the award. Again, so long as the award is binding on a party, breach of any of its terms will make the party liable to penalty under Section 29 of the Act, to imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine or with both. After the period of its operation and also the period for which the award is binding have elapsed Section 23 and Section 29 can have no operation. We can however see nothing in the scheme of the [Industrial Disputes Act]  to justify a conclusion that merely because these special provisions as regards prohibition of strikes and lock-outs and of penalties for breach of award cease to be effective the new contract as embodied in the award should also cease to be effective. On the contrary, the very purpose for which industrial adjudication has been given the peculiar authority and right of making new contracts between employers and workmen makes it reasonable to think that even though the period of operation of the award and the period for which it remains binding on the parties - in respect of both of which special provisions have been made under Sections 23 and 29 respectively - may expire, the new contract would continue to govern the relations between the parties till it is displaced by another contract. The objection that no such benefit as claimed could accrue to the respondent after March 31, 1959 must therefore be rejected.\" 139\\. It is the underlined portion of this paragraph which impelled the High Court to come to the conclusion that even a notice under Section 19(6) of the ID Act would not terminate a settlement (which, according to the High Court, stands on the same footing as an award and, in fact is indistinguishable there from for the purpose of Section 19) but would have the effect of merely paving the way for fresh negotiations resulting ultimately in a new settlement - a conclusion which has been seriously challenged on behalf of the Corporation with the submission that Chacko case has no application whatsoever to the present controversy inasmuch as the special law comprised of Sections 11 and 49 of the LIC Act fully covers the situation in the 3rd period following the expiry of the 1974 settlements. The submission is well based. In Chacko case this Court was dealing with the provisions of the ID Act alone when it made the observations last extracted and was not concerned with a situation which would cover the 3rd period in relation to an award (or for that matter a settlement) in accordance with a specific mandate from Parliament. The only available course for filling the void created by the Sastry Award was a continuation of its terms till they were replaced by something else legally enforceable which, in the circumstances before the court, could only be another contract (in the shape of an award [pic]or a settlement), there being no legal provision requiring the void to be filled otherwise. In the present case the law intervenes to indicate how the void which obtains in the 3rd period shall be filled and, if it has been so filled, there is no question of its being filled in the manner indicated in Chacko case wherein, as already pointed out, no such law was available. The observations in that case must thus be taken to mean that the expired award would continue to govern the parties till it is displaced by another contract or by a relationship otherwise substituted for it in accordance with law.\" In view of the statement of law laid down by this Court in the above referred case, the reliance placed upon para 43 and 47 of D. J. Bahadur case and other cases relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the Corporation are misplaced and the same do not support the case of the Corporation. 27\\. In view of the law laid by this Court in the case referred to supra, both the Award of Justice Tulpule reiterated by way of clarification Award by Justice Jamdar are still operative as the same are not terminated by either of the parties as provided under Section 19(6) of the Act. The compromise between the parties in SLP No. 14906 of 1988 and the Scheme formed in E. Prabhavathy & Ors. and G. Sudhakar & Ors. (supra) do not amount to substitution of the Awards passed by Justice R. D. Tulpule and by Justice S. M. Jamdar. Hence, in view of the aforesaid reasons, the submissions made by Mr. Naphade, learned amicus curiae, in justification of the Award passed by the CGIT is based on the terms and conditions laid down in the Awards passed by the NIT (by Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar) in favour of the workmen for absorption as they have been rendering their service to the Corporation in the perennial nature of work for a number of years and hence, the High Court was not justified in interfering with the said Award passed by the CGIT. The said contention urged by the learned amicus curiae is accepted by us, as the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is contrary to the Awards referred to supra, the provisions of the [Industrial Disputes Act]  of the Act. Until then, the said Award passed by the NIT will still be operative in law. Therefore, the same has been rightly applied to the fact situation on hand in the Award passed by the CGIT and it could not have been set aside by the High Court. Thus, we are of the opinion that the learned single Judge erroneously set aside the Award passed by the CGIT and the said judgment of the learned single judge has been further erroneously affirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court. The said judgments of the High Court are clearly contrary to law and legal principles laid down by this Court in cases referred to supra. Hence, the same are liable to be set aside by allowing these appeals and restoring the Award of the CGIT. 28\\. The learned amicus curiae rightly placed reliance upon entry Item No.10 of Schedule V of the Act in employing the concerned workmen as temporary, badli and part-time employees against permanent posts doing perennial nature of work and continuing them as such for number of years. This is a clear case of unfair labour practice as defined under Section 2(ra) of the Act which is statutorily prohibited under Section 25T of the Act and the said action of the Corporation amounts to penalty under Section 25U of the Act. For this reason also, the findings and reasons recorded in the Award of the CGIT in answering the points of dispute referred to it by Central Government in favour of the concerned workmen is legal and valid. The High Court has erred in not noticing the aforesaid important, relevant, factual and legal aspect of the case of the concerned workmen and has erroneously set aside the Award of the CGIT passed in favour of the concerned workmen in exercise of its judicial power. The High Court has erred in not following the legal principles laid down by this Court in the case of [?CITATION?], wherein it is held thus:- \"17\\. Before concluding, we consider it necessary to observe that while exercising jurisdiction under Articles 226 and/or 227 of the Constitution in matters like the present one, the High Courts are duty bound to keep in mind that the [Industrial Disputes Act] , 43 and 43A in particular, which mandate that the State should secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people, ensure equality between men and women and equitable distribution of material resources of the community to sub-serve the common good and also ensure that the workers get their dues. More than 41 years ago, Gajendragadkar, J, opined that \"the concept of social and economic justice is a living concept of revolutionary import; it gives sustenance to the rule of law and meaning and significance to the ideal of welfare State\" [?CITATION?]\" The said principle has been reiterated by this Court recently in the case of [?CITATION?] For the aforesaid reasons also, the case of the concerned workmen/appellants must succeed and the impugned judgment and order must be set aside. Accordingly, it is set aside. Answer to point (iii) It is needless to mention that since we are of the view that the Award passed by the CGIT in I.D. No. 27 of 1991 is legal and valid, it shall be restored and implemented by the Corporation by absorbing the concerned workmen in the permanent posts and if they have attained the age of superannuation, the Corporation will be liable to pay all consequential benefits including monetary benefits taking into consideration the pay scale and revised pay scale from time to time by the Corporation. Mr. Shekar Naphade, learned amicus curiae has rendered excellent assistance to this Court at our request to arrive at just conclusions in these cases. The same is appreciated and placed on record. This Judgment and order shall be implemented within eight weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of this Judgment and the compliance report of the same shall be submitted for perusal of this Court. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed in the above said terms. All the applications are disposed of. No costs. ..................................................................J. [V.

Lalit, learned senior counsel prefaced his submissions by stating that appellants were all proceeded against based on the footing that they were members of an organization called \"Abhinav Bharat\" which was registered in 2007 and that they were now being prosecuted under the provisions of MCOCA. The learned senior counsel submitted that in order to prosecute the appellants under the MCOCA, the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\", \"organized crime\" and \"organized crime syndicate\" as defined under Section 2(1)(d),(e) and (f) of MCOCA should be satisfied. The learned senior counsel while referring to the above definitions submitted that the prosecuting agency were relying upon the Parbhani case and Jalna case which occurred in 2003 and 2004 and which were organized by RSS and Bajrang Dal with which neither Abhinav Bharat nor the appellants were in anyway connected and, therefore, the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\" or \"organized crime\" as well as \"organized crime syndicate\" was not fully established.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: The next submission of Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel was that in order to attract Section 2(1)(d) for an offence to be a 'continuing unlawful activity' within a period of preceding ten years from the date of the third occurrence, two prior cases falling under the said Section should have been filed and taken cognizance of and that the date with reference to which the preceding ten years is to be counted is the date of third occurrence. The learned senior counsel, therefore, submitted that the Malegaon bomb blast occurred on 29.09.2008, the arrest of Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade was on 02.11.2008, supplementary charge-sheet against him was filed in Parbhani case on 13.11.2008 and in Jalna case on 15.11.2008 and in Parbhani, the case was committed to Sessions Court only on 29.4.2009 i.e.\n",
      "Paragraph 19: not within the preceding 10 years of the occurrence in Malegaon and, therefore, the definition of Section 2(1) (d) was not satisfied. Even with reference to Jalna, the learned senior counsel submitted that the Express Order of cognizance was taken only on 28.11.2008 i.e. after the occurrence in Malegaon, namely, 29.09.2008. Therefore, the requirement of preceding ten years in order to bring the earlier two occurrences in Parbhani and Jalna within the definition of 2(1)(d) as continuing unlawful activities was not made out. The learned senior counsel in this context submitted that the conclusion of the Division Bench that cognizance is always with reference to the offence and not the offender, is not the correct legal position. The learned senior counsel after referring to Sections 173(2)(i)(a), 190(1)(b) and 178 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) submitted that a close reading of the above Sections shows that the cognizance will be with reference to the offender and not the offence. The learned senior counsel, therefore, submitted that in the case of Jalna the Express Order of cognizance was taken on 28.11.2008 after the supplementary charge-sheet dated 15.11.2008 against Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade, which was long after the date of occurrence of Malegaon, namely, 29.09.2008, and, therefore, the requirement of two earlier cases as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) was not satisfied. The learned senior counsel relied upon the decisions in  [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] in support of his submissions.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel then contended that the event of cognizance being taken as defined under Section 2(1) (d) can only be with reference to 'competent court' and in the case of Parbhani and Jalna as the offences were under Sections 302, 307/308 etc., Sessions Court was the competent court and not the Chief Judicial Magistrate. The learned senior counsel pointed out that in the case of Parbhani, the committal order was passed only on 29.04.2009 i.e. long after the Malegaon case occurrence, namely, 29.09.2008. Therefore, the requirement of two earlier cases which were taken cognizance of by the competent court cannot be held to have been satisfied. In support of the said submission, learned senior counsel relied upon [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 21: The learned senior counsel then contended that in order to attract the provisions of MCOCA, in all the three cases, the same gang must have been involved. Elaborating his submission, the learned senior counsel contended that Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade who has been added as A-7 in Malegaon case was arrested on 02.11.2008 and his arrest was shown in Parbhani and in Jalna on 13.11.2008 and 15.11.2008 as directed by the Additional Police Commissioner of ATS and even going by the statement of A-7, he procured some materials and gave them to one principal accused in Parbhani and Jalna, namely, Devle and going by the said statement, there is no scope to link the appellant with the cases which related to Parbhani and Jalna and, therefore, the requirement of involvement of the same gang in all the three cases was not satisfied. The learned senior counsel submitted that in any event, the appellants were not concerned with Parbhani and Jalna, that they were not even aware of A-7's involvement in those two occurrences, as they were not members of those gangs which were involved in Parbhani and Jalna and, therefore, the invocation of MCOCA was not made out. The learned senior counsel further contended that it was all the more reason to hold that cognizance should be with reference to the offender and not the offence which has to be mandatorily satisfied.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: The learned senior counsel lastly submitted that going by the definition of 'organized crime' under Section 2(1) (e), there must have been a pecuniary gain accompanied by the act of violence, that the appellant had not taken any money from anybody and when such pecuniary advantage should have been present in all the three cases, it cannot be held that the case against the appellant would come under the definition of 'organized crime'. According to learned senior counsel, in the case of Parbhani and Jalna, only violence was the basis and promoting insurgency was not even the case of prosecution which may have a semblance of application in Malegaon case and certainly not in Parbhani and Jalna. The learned senior counsel, therefore, contended that the application of MCOCA as against the appellants was wholly inappropriate and consequently, the order of the Division Bench and the subsequent order of the Special Court in declining to grant bail was liable to be set aside. The learned senior counsel submitted that the appellants made out a case to show that there were reasonable grounds for believing that he was not guilty of such offence under MCOCA and as provided under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA and should have been granted bail. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the appellant in Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70 of 2010 as well as in SLP (Crl.) Nos.9370-71 of 2011 has been in jail for more than six years and he is entitled for grant of bail.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: Mr. Triloki Nath Razdan, learned counsel appearing for the appellants in the appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.9303/2011 while adopting the arguments of Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel for the appellant in Crl.A.No.1969-70/2010 contended that the Objects and Reasons of MCOCA shows that the very purport of the enactment was to curb the accumulation of illegal wealth, that in order to attract the provisions of MCOCA, involvement in organized crime by an organized crime syndicate in all the three cases must be satisfied. By referring to the sanction order dated 15.01.2009, learned counsel submitted that when the arrest of Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade was in the month of November, 2008, the requirement of Section 2(1) (d) relating to two previous cases of continuing unlawful activity was not satisfied. In other words, according to learned counsel, as the requirement of continuing unlawful activity in respect of an organized crime by the organized crime syndicate was not shown, MCOCA was not attracted. The learned counsel relied upon in [?CITATION?] and [?CITATION?] & [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 24: Mr. Patil, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant in SLP (Crl.) No.8132/2010 referred to the impugned judgment of the Division Bench, in particular, paragraph 18 and submitted that the question which was posed for consideration by the Division Bench was limited to the extent of examining the issue of taking cognizance of the offences by the Chief Judicial Magistrate at Parbhani and its counterpart at Jalna. Sofaras the appellant in the present appeal was concerned, learned senior counsel submitted that she became a Sanyasin after performing appropriate Hindu religious rites and prayers on 30.01.2007, that she was residing in an ashram at Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh and that she owned a two wheeler LML- Freedom which she sold out to one Sunil Joshi of Madhya Pradesh way back in October, 2004 for a sale consideration of Rs.24,000/- and she also signed the necessary transfer application Forms in October, 2004 itself and that thereafter she had no control over the said vehicle. The learned senior counsel submitted that inspite of her disclosing the above facts, the officials of ATS applied third degree methods upon her and insisted that the said vehicle was involved in Malegaon blast occurrence and, therefore, she was also involved in the said occurrence. The learned senior counsel submitted that she was implicated in the Malegaon case while she is innocent simply because the vehicle bearing registration No.MH-15-P-4572, which she owned, was stated to have been involved in the Malegaon blast.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: The learned senior counsel then submitted that if the Objects and Reasons is read for interpreting Section 3, a strict application of the Act should be made, in which event, in order to invoke the provisions of MCOCA Section 2(1)(d), (e) and (f) should be satisfied. It was contended that for implicating a person it is to be mandatorily shown that he was involved in a 'continuing unlawful activity' as a member of crime syndicate or on behalf of it on two earlier occasions, that the appellant was not involved in either the Parbhani case or in Jalna case and, therefore, the invocation of MCOCA against the appellant was not maintainable. The learned senior counsel also submitted that having regard to the relevant dates with reference to the committal order in Jalna case, namely, 11.8.2008, the subsequent charge-sheet against A-7 on 15.11.2008 on which date the case was registered afresh as RCC No.648/2008 and on 28.11.2008 when committal order was passed, the sanction order in Malegaon case being 20.11.2008, there was no scope to hold that there were two earlier cases falling within the definition of continuing unlawful activity as defined under Section 2(1)(d) of the Act. The learned senior counsel, therefore, contended that the order of the trial Court dated 31.07.2009 discharging all the accused was justified and the Division Bench ought not to have interfered with the said order.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: The learned senior counsel also submitted that the Division Bench having noted that the offence under Section 153A, IPC was not laid after getting prior sanction as required under Section 196 Cr.P.C. even as against A-7 Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade, there was no valid cognizance taken by the trial Court in respect of the earlier cases of Parbhani and Jalna. The learned Senior Counsel, therefore, contended that in the absence of the 'continuing unlawful activity' as defined under Section 2(1)(d) of an 'organized crime' by 'organized crime syndicate' shown, application of MCOCA was not justified. As far as the preceding 10 years as prescribed under Section 2(1)(d) is concerned, learned senior counsel submitted that Section 2(1)(d) specifically refers to 'activity' for calculating the preceding 10 years and, therefore, 29.09.2008 would be the relevant date and calculated on that basis the claim of the prosecution that there were two earlier cases as stipulated under Section 2 (1)(d) was not satisfied. In support of this submission, learned senior counsel relied upon the decisions of this Court reported as [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?] and Tolaram Relumal & [?CITATION?] Mr. Vikas Mehta, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010, namely, Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade after making reference to the judgment in Mahipal Singh (supra) contended that prior to the registration of FIR No.130 of 2008 on 30.09.2008 in the Malegaon blast case, the appellant was not involved in any 'continuing unlawful activity'.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: According to him, if a strict interpretation is to be placed on the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' as stated in the said decision of this Court, the appellant having been not involved in the commission of any offence prior to registration of FIR No.130/2008 either singly or jointly as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate, invocation of MCOCA was not justified. The learned counsel then contended that in order to invoke MCOCA all the three definitions of Section 2 (1) (d), (e) and (f) should be satisfied in which event it should be by the same gang in all the three cases. The learned counsel then contended that since strict interpretation is to be made as directed by this Court while upholding the validity of the Act, it should be construed only in that manner. The learned counsel by relying upon the decisions in Ranjitsing Brahamjeetsing Sharma (supra), Lalit Somdatta Nagpal (supra) and Mahipal Singh (supra) contended that the requirement of satisfaction of 'continuing unlawful activity' of an 'organized crime' by an 'organized crime syndicate' insofar as it related to the appellant was not made out and the application of the MCOCA was not justified. Mr. S.S. Shamshery, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.58/2011 submitted that he is adopting the arguments of Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel for appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1969-70 of 2010 and the judgment of the Division Bench is liable to be set aside.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: As against the above submissions made on behalf of the appellants, Mr. Anil Singh, learned ASG for the respondent State submitted that the Division Bench after formulating the question in paragraph 18 ascertained the relevant dates when cognizance was taken in Parbhani case and in Jalna case by the Committal Court and in both the cases cognizance was taken as early as on 07.09.2006 in Parbhani and on 30.9.2006 in Jalna which were borne out by records and, therefore, the Division Bench was justified in setting aside the order of the Special Court. In support of his submission that taking a fresh cognizance is not a requirement of law in a case where cognizance is already taken in respect of the same offence, reliance was placed upon [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]; [[?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?], [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 29: According to learned ASG, in respect of an offence under MCOCA, for invoking its provisions, cognizance of the offence taken as provided under Section 190 Cr.P.C. was sufficient. The learned ASG then submitted that in order to ascertain a 'continuing unlawful activity' as defined under Section 2 (1) (d) of the MCOCA what is required is commission of such an offence as a member of either 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of 'organized crime syndicate' would mean any 'organized crime syndicate' and not the same 'organized crime syndicate'. As far as the contention relating to two earlier cases in the preceding 10 years, the learned ASG submitted that in the Malegaon case, the occurrence was on 29.09.2008 and in the preceding 10 years i.e. on 07.09.2006 cognizance was taken in the Parbhani case and in Jalna case cognizance was taken on 30.09.2006 and, therefore, the same was sufficient to hold that the appellants were involved in a 'continuing unlawful activity' and thereby satisfied the requirement of 2 (1) (d) (e) and (f) of MCOCA. The learned ASG sought to distinguish the case in Mahipal Singh (supra). The learned ASG by relying upon [?CITATION?] submitted that insurgency is a grave disturbance of public order and, therefore, the question of pecuniary advantage was not needed where promotion of insurgency formed the basis for prosecuting the appellants under MCOCA. On 'other advantage', learned ASG relied upon [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 30: Mr. Mariaarputham, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of Maharashtra and NIA after referring to the accusations against the accused submitted that going by the allegations and the gravity of the offence, they are not entitled for bail. The learned senior counsel also submitted that apart from offences under the MCOCA, the appellants are also proceeded under the [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967]  of MCOCA, it is not necessary that for the commission of such aggressive offences, there should be allegation of pecuniary advantage also.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: According to learned senior counsel, insofar as, promotion of insurgency is concerned, even without any allegation of pecuniary gain, the said act by itself would constitute an 'organized crime'. The learned senior counsel, therefore, contended that even in the absence of any allegation of pecuniary gain, the offence alleged would fall under the category of 'organized crime'. The learned senior counsel further contended that in any event there were materials to show that the appellant in Criminal Appeal 1969-70/2010 as well as the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010 had pecuniary advantage. The learned senior counsel then contended that cognizance of the offence was taken by the Magistrate based on the charge- sheet and when once there was application of judicial mind with a view to proceed with the matter, the requirement of cognizance was fulfilled.\n",
      "Paragraph 32: Insofar as the offences pertaining to Parbhani and Jalna were concerned, the learned senior counsel contended that they were all IPC offences and, therefore, taking cognizance of those offences need not be tested on the anvil of the provisions of MCOCA. The learned senior counsel placed reliance upon the decisions in [?CITATION?]. He also placed reliance upon [?CITATION?],[?CITATION?].\n",
      "Paragraph 33: On the submission relating to competent Court, learned senior counsel submitted that in Parbhani and Jalna reference needs to be made only to Sections 190, 200, 201, 202 read with Section 4 Cr.P.C. and when on a complaint filed by the prosecution, the CJM having taken cognizance, the same was sufficient for the fulfillment of requirement of the 'continuing unlawful activity' as defined under Section 2 (1) (d) of the MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: According to learned senior counsel, for the purpose of taking cognizance under the above provisions, the presence of the accused was not necessary.\n",
      "Paragraph 35: As far as the relevant date is concerned, according to learned senior counsel, even if the date of occurrence of Malegaon blast, namely, 29.9.2008 is taken as the relevant date, the committal Court having taken cognizance by receipt of the charge-sheet dated 07.09.2006 in respect of Parbhani and on 30.09.2006 in the case of Jalna and the committal order was on 12.02.2007 in Jalna, the cognizance was well before 29.09.2008 and, therefore, there was nothing lacking for the purpose of invoking the provisions of MCOCA. The learned senior counsel further contended that as long as all the three incidents were committed by a group of persons and one common individual was involved in all the three incidents, that would attract invocation of MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 36: Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned ASG also appearing for NIA submitted that in the event of granting bail, having regard to the nature of offence alleged to have been indulged in by the appellants, severe conditions should be imposed and that the agency is entitled for custodial interrogation and also the presence of the accused at the time of trial should be ensured.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: By way of reply Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel submitted that the prosecution has not shown involvement of 'Abhinav Bharat' in the Parbhani case or Jalna case in which event if 'Abhinav Bharat' is to be excluded, the linking of the appellants by making reference to Abhinav Bharat will also entitle them to contend that MCOCA cannot be invoked. The learned senior counsel submitted that since MCOCA has been invoked for the purpose of ascertaining the cognizance of the offence, reference to Section 2(1)(d) would alone be made and not under Section 190 Cr.P.C. The learned senior counsel further contended that cognizance by the competent Court in the facts and the nature of offence alleged in Parbhani and Jalna would only mean the Sessions Court under Section 209 Cr.P.C. and, therefore, there is a serious doubt as to the application of MCOCA. The learned senior counsel, therefore, contended that such doubt should be held in favour of the appellants under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA and the appellants should be granted bail.\n",
      "Paragraph 38: Mr. Patil, learned senior counsel for the appellant in appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8132/2010 submitted that when the case of the said appellant is considered with reference to additional charge-sheet, appellant being a lady suffering from cancer and her implication was because of sale of her two wheeler four years before the occurrence, applying the decision in Salap Service Station (supra), she is entitled for the grant of bail.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: Having noted the submissions of respective counsel, at the outset, we want to note the specific challenges made in these appeals. As far as the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1969-70 of 2010 is concerned, he along with the other appellants is aggrieved by the common judgment of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Crl.A. Nos.866, 867, 868, 869 and 1024 of 2009 dated 19.07.2010. By the said judgment, the Division Bench set aside the order of the Special Judge dated 31.07.2009 in Special Case No.1/2009.\n",
      "Paragraph 40: While setting aside the said order of the Special Judge, the Division Bench directed the Special Judge to consider the bail applications in Bail Application Nos.40-42 of 2008 and pass orders on merits. In fact, the Special Judge in his order dated 31.07.2009 took the view that MCOCA was not applicable to Special Case No.1/2009 and consequently by invoking Section 11 of MCOCA, directed the case to be tried by the regular Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: Therefore, when we examine the correctness of the judgment of the Division Bench dated 19.07.2010 in Crl. A Nos.866/2009 and connected appeals, if the said judgment is to be upheld, the consequence would be to the consideration of the bail applications under Section 21 of the MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: It is relevant to note that after the order of the Division Bench dated 19.7.2010, the Special Judge dealt with the Bail Applications Nos. 40-42 of 2008 and dismissed all the applications. Thereafter, those orders were the subject matter of challenge in Criminal Bail Application No.333/2011 with Criminal Application No.464/2011 insofar as the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1969-70/2010 is concerned. One other appellant namely, Ajay Eknath Rahirkar filed Criminal Application No.556/2011 which was allowed by the Bombay High Court and he was granted bail by imposing certain conditions. As far as Criminal Application No.333/2011 was concerned, the said application was rejected and the main Criminal Application No.464/2011 was disposed of by the High Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: The appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971 of 2010 was one of the respondents in Criminal Appeal No.868 of 2009 which was disposed of by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court by its order dated 19.07.2010 along with the connected appeals preferred by the State of Maharashtra through ATS which is the prosecuting agency in respect of the Special Case No.1 of 2009 on the file of the Special Judge under MCOCA. The said appellant was also aggrieved by the order of the Division Bench referred to above in having set aside the order of the Special Judge dated 31.07.2009. The appellant in the appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.8132/2010 is also similarly placed like that of the appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70/2010 and Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: Having thus noted the grievances of the appellants in the above referred to appeals as against the order of the Division Bench dated 19.07.2010 as well as the subsequent order of the learned Single Judge in having declined to grant bail by confirming the order of the Special Court in Bail Application No.42 of 2008, from the above referred to details gathered from the appeal papers as well as the orders impugned in these appeals the scope for consideration in these appeals pertains to the questions:- Whether the common order of the Division Bench dated 19.07.2010 in having set aside the order of the Special Judge in Special Case No.1 of 2009 discharging the appellants from the said case on the ground that MCOCA was not applicable to the said case and consequently the case was to be tried by the Regular Court under Section 11 of MCOCA calls for interference? If answer to question No. (a) is in the negative, whether for the purpose of grant of bail under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA, can it be held that the application of the said Act is not made out against the appellants and consequently the rejection of bail by the trial Court and as confirmed by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court is justified? Having thus ascertained the scope involved in these appeals by virtue of the orders impugned herein, when we consider the submissions of learned counsel for the appellants, we find that the sum and substance of the submissions can be summarized as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 45: \"That the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity', 'organized crime' or 'organized crime syndicate' as defined under Section 2(1)(d)(e) and (f) of MCOCA was not cumulatively satisfied in order to proceed with the Special Case No.1 of 2009 for the alleged commission of offence of organized crime under Section 3 of MCOCA.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 46: In order to find an answer to the said question a detailed reference to some of the provisions of MCOCA, its Objects and Reasons and some other provisions of the Cr.P.C. are required to be noted.

As far as the Cr.P.C. is concerned, reference will have to be made to Sections 4, 173(2) & (8), 190, 191, 192, 193, 200, 201 and 209. In order to appreciate the said provisions the same are extracted as under:\n",

      "Paragraph 91: In the first instance, it will be profitable to examine the scheme of MCOCA by making a cursory glance to the Objects and Reasons and thereafter to make an intensive reading of the above referred to provisions. When we peruse the Objects and Reasons, it discloses that organized crime has been posing very serious threat to our society for quite some years and it was also noted that organized crime syndicates had a common cause with terrorist gangs. In the Objects and Reasons, the foremost consideration was the serious threat to the society by those who were indulging in organized crimes in the recent years apart from organized crime criminals operating hand in glove with terrorist gangs. It is common knowledge that for the terrorist gangs, the sole object is to create panic in the minds of peace loving members of the society and in that process attempt to achieve some hidden agenda which cannot be easily identified, but certainly will not be in the general interest or well being of the society. Those who prefer to act in such clandestine manner and activities will formulate their own mind- set and ill-will towards others and attempt to achieve their objectives by indulging in unlawful hazardous criminal activities unmindful of the serious consequences and in majority of such cases it results in severe loss of life of innocent people apart from extensive damage to the properties of public at large. It was further found that the existing legal framework, that is the penal and procedural laws and the adjudicatory system, were found to be inadequate to curb or control the menace of 'organized crime'. The Objects and Reasons also states that such 'organized crimes' were filled by illegal wealth generated by contract killing, extrusion, smuggling in contraband, illegal trade in narcotics, kidnapping for ransom, collection of protection money, money laundering etc. Keeping the above serious repercussions referred to in the Objects and Reasons, when we examine Section 2(1)(d)(e)&(f), which defines 'continuing unlawful activity', 'organized crime' or 'organized crime syndicate', we find that the three definitions are closely interlinked.\n",
      "Paragraph 92: The definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' under Section 2(1)(d) mainly refers to an activity prohibited by law. The said activity should be a cognizable offence, punishable with imprisonment of three years or more.\n",
      "Paragraph 93: The commission of such offence should have been undertaken either by an individual singly or by joining with others either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or even if as an individual or by joining hands with others even if not as a member of a 'organized crime syndicate' such commission of an offence should have been on behalf of such syndicate. It further states that in order to come within the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' there should have been more than one charge-sheet filed before a competent Court within the preceding period of 10 years and that the said Court should have taken cognizance of such offence.\n",
      "Paragraph 94: Before getting into the nuances of the said definition of 'continuing unlawful activity', it will be worthwhile to get a broad idea of the definition of 'organized crime' under Section 2(1)(e) and 'organized crime syndicate' under Section 2(1)(f). An 'organized crime' should be any 'continuing unlawful activity' either by an individual singly or jointly, either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of such syndicate. The main ingredient of the said definition is that such 'continuing unlawful activity' should have been indulged in by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means. Further such violence and other activity should have been indulged in with an objective of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. Therefore, an 'organized crime' by nature of violent action indulged in by an individual singly or jointly either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of such syndicate should have been either with an object for making pecuniary gains or undue economic or other advantage or for promoting insurgency. If the object was for making pecuniary gains it can be either for himself or for any other person. But we notice for promoting insurgency, there is no such requirement of any personal interest or the interest of any other person or body. The mere indulgence in a violent activity etc. either for pecuniary gain or other advantage or for promoting insurgency as an individual, either singly or jointly as a member of 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of a such syndicate would be sufficient for bringing the said activity within the four corners of the definition of 'organized crime'.\n",
      "Paragraph 95: An 'organized crime syndicate' is a group of two or more persons who by acting singly or collectively as a syndicate or gang indulge in activities of 'organized crime'.\n",
      "Paragraph 96: By conspectus reading of the above three definitions, if in the preceding 10 years from the date of third continuing unlawful activity if more than one charge-sheet has been filed before a competent Court which had taken cognizance of such offence which would result in imposition of a punishment of three years or more, undertaken by a person individually or jointly either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on its behalf, such crime if falls within the definition of 'organized crime', the invocation of MCOCA would be the resultant position.\n",
      "Paragraph 97: Keeping the above broad prescription as the outcome of the definition of Section 2(1)(d)(e)&(f) in mind, when we refer to Section 3, we find that it is a penal provision under which, the various punishments for the commission of 'organized crime' have been set out and such punishment can be up to life imprisonment and even death, apart from fine subject to minimum of Rupees one lakh to maximum of Rupees five lakhs. The imprisonment ranges from five years to life imprisonment and can also result in imposition of death penalty. Section 17 prescribes Special Rules of evidence notwithstanding anything contrary contained in Cr.P.C. or the Indian Evidence Act for the purposes of trial and punishment for offences under MCOCA. Section 18 of the Act is again a non-obstante clause which states that irrespective of any provision in the Code or in the Indian Evidence Act, and subject to the provisions of said Section, a confession made by a person before a police officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police and recorded by such police officer either in writing or in any mechanical devices like cassettes, tapes or sound tracks from which sounds or images can be reproduced shall be admissible in the trial of such person or co-accused abettor or conspirator provided they are charged and tried in the same case together with the accused. Section 20 is yet another provision under MCOCA which prescribes that where a person is convicted of any of the offence punishable under MCOCA, the Special Court may in addition to awarding any punishment, by order in writing declare that any property, movable or immovable or both, belonging to the accused and specified in the order shall stand forfeited to the State Government free from all encumbrances etc. Under Section 21, which again is a non- obstante clause, the provisions of the Act notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or any other law shall be deemed to be a cognizable offence within the meaning of clause (c) of Section 2 of the Code and \"cognizable case\" as defined in that clause should be constructed accordingly.\n",
      "Paragraph 98: Under Section 21(4) notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, no person accused of an offence punishable under MCOCA, when he is in custody, should be released on bail on his own bond unless under sub-clause (b) of sub-section (4) even when the Public Prosecutor opposes the application for bail, the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the said accused is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.\n",
      "Paragraph 99: Under Section 22 there is a rebuttable presumption of commission of organized crime punishable under Section 3 unless the contrary is proved.\n",
      "Paragraph 100: Under Section 23 a safeguard is provided to the effect that under Section 23(1)(a) no information about the commission of an offence of organized crime under MCOCA should be recorded by a police officer without the prior approval of a police officer not below the rank of Deputy Inspector General of Police. Further under Section 23(1)(b) no investigation of an offence under MCOCA shall be carried out by a police officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police. Under sub-Section (2) of Section 23, no Special Court should take cognizance of any offence under MCOCA without the previous sanction of the police officer not below the rank of Additional Director General of Police.\n",
      "Paragraph 101: Reference to the above provisions thus discloses that the Act is very stringent in its operation when it comes to the question of dealing with an 'organized crime' committed by an 'organized crime syndicate' in respect of a 'continuing unlawful activity'. With the above salient features of the provisions of MCOCA in mind, when we consider the various submissions of the learned counsel, the main submissions of the learned counsel for the appellants were five-fold.\n",
      "Paragraph 102: The first submission was that the present appellants were all alleged to have been involved in a bomb blast which occurred on 29.09.2008 at a place called 'Malegaon'. According to the prosecuting agency, the appellants were either member of an organization called 'Abhinav Bharat' which was registered in the year 2007 or the commission of the offence was jointly with the members of the said organization for and on its behalf. The contention in the foremost was that in order to rope in the appellants on the above footing, the requirement of Section 2(1)(d), namely, 'continuing unlawful activity' must have been satisfied. In order to demonstrate such compliance, it was contended on behalf of the prosecuting agency that there were two earlier occurrences of bomb blasts one in Parbhani on 21.11.2003 and another at Jalna on 27.08.2004, that on those two earlier occurrences A- 7, namely, Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade was involved who is also a member of the present gang and consequently the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' is satisfied.\n",
      "Paragraph 103: The learned counsel for the appellants on the other hand contended that A-7 was not a member of the so-called 'Abhinav Bharat', that 'Abhinav Bharat' as an organization was not indisputably involved in the two earlier occurrences in the year 2003 and 2004, therefore, when such clear demarcation existed as between the appellants, the so-called members of Abhinav Bharat and the earlier occurrences of 2003 and 2004, as well as, the exclusion of A-7 as member of 'Abhinav Bharat' there was no scope to invoke MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 104: We are, in the first instance, concerned with the appellant's challenge to the order of the Division Bench dated 19.07.2010 wherein the sole question considered pertains to the application of MCOCA based on the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' under Section 2(1)(d) for the purpose of grant of bail under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA. To recapitulate the background of this litigation, it was the order of discharge passed by the Special Judge in Special Case No.1 of 2009 dated 31.07.2009 on the footing that cognizance of two earlier cases within preceding 10 years from the date of third occurrence dated 29.09.2008 was not satisfied and based on the said conclusion the Special Judge passed the order of discharge and also simultaneously passed an order under Section 11 for the transfer of the Special Case No.1 of 2009 to the Regular Court which went before the Division Bench at the instance of the State and the prosecuting agency.\n",
      "Paragraph 105: The Division Bench while dealing with the said conclusion of the Special Court took a contrary view holding that the Special Judge misdirected himself by stating that the cognizance was with reference to the offender and not the offence which led to the passing of such an illegal order dated 31.07.2009. The Division Bench took the view that going by the provisions contained in Section 2(1)(d) read along with Sections 190 and 173(3) of the Cr.P.C., as well as the settled principles in the various decisions of this Court, the cognizance of offence was taken as early as on 07.09.2006 in the Parbhani case and 30.09.2006 in the Jalna case, which were within the preceding 10 years from the date of the occurrence of Malegaon case, namely, 29.09.2008 and therefore, the order of discharge passed by the Special Judge was not sustainable and valid in law.\n",
      "Paragraph 106: Having recapitulated the background to the above extent when we examine the contentions raised, it must be stated that the conclusion of the Division Bench as regards the cognizance aspect cannot be held to be totally erroneous when it struck down the order of the Special Judge dated 31.07.2009. Keeping aside for the present the various other submissions and considering the opening submission of the counsel while assailing the order of Division Bench wherein we confine to the question relating to taking cognizance of the offence as set out apparently in Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA. In that perception, on the opening submission of the learned counsel for the appellants we too have no hesitation to hold that the cognizance of the offence as stated to have been rightly taken into account in respect of Parbhani and Jalna based on the charge-sheets dated 07.09.2006 and 30.09.2006 respectively was perfectly in order to apply the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' for the purpose of invoking MCOCA with reference to Malegaon occurrence. We, however, wish to examine in detail the justification for our above conclusion when we deal with the other contentions where submissions were made in extenso with particular reference to the involvement of A-7 in the alleged occurrences of Parbhani and Jalna, more particularly with reference to the date of supplementary charge-sheet, arrest made and the arrest made with reference to Malegaon occurrence and the alleged nexus as between the appellants and A-7 in order to find out whether application of MCOCA could still be held to be validly made by the prosecuting agency. For the present by reaching our conclusion as above on the first submission, we proceed to deal with the next submission of learned counsel for the appellants.\n",
      "Paragraph 107: The submission of the learned counsel for the appellants was that under Section 2(1)(d), in order to construe a 'continuing unlawful activity' two earlier charge-sheets in the preceding 10 years should exist and that such charge-sheets should have been taken cognizance by the competent court within the said period of 10 years and it must have been accomplished. It was also contended that for ascertaining the said position, the date of the third occurrence should be the relevant date for counting the preceding 10 years. Insofar as that claim is concerned, it can be straight away accepted that since Section 2(1)(d) uses the expression 'an activity' in the very opening set of expressions, which is prohibited by law, the date of such activity, namely, the third one can be taken as the relevant date for the purpose of finding out the two earlier charge-sheets in the preceding 10 years, in which event in the present case, the preceding 10 years will have to be counted from 29.09.2008 which was the date when the third occurrence of Malegaon bomb blast took place.\n",
      "Paragraph 108: With reference to Malegaon bomb blast, A-7 is the key person to be noted as it was with reference to his involvement in the earlier two bomb blast cases, namely, Parbhani and Jalna the whole case of the prosecution for invoking MCOCA was developed. Even while examining the various other submissions, we want to once again reiterate that our present endeavour is for examining the correctness of the order of the Division Bench which stems from the first order of the Special Judge dated 31.07.2009 by which the appellants were discharged and the consequential order under Section 11 transferring the case to the Regular Court. It must also be stated that our endeavour in this respect is also for the purpose of finding an answer to the prescription contained in Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 109: Therefore, what all to be examined is whether cognizance of the earlier two offences as mentioned in the definition of Section 2(1)(d) was duly taken within the preceding period of 10 years. Having stated in uncontroverted terms that 29.09.2008 is the relevant date, namely the date of third occurrence (i.e.) Malegaon bomb blast, when we go back, the question is whether in respect of the bomb blast in Parbhani on 21.11.2003 and similar bomb blast in Jalna on 27.08.2004 the charge-sheets were filed and cognizance was taken by the competent court within the said period of preceding 10 years. There is no controversy as to the date of occurrence of the above two bomb blasts. There is also no dispute that the very first charge-sheet in Parbhani as against A-1 was filed on 07.09.2006 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate. Similarly, the filing of the first charge-sheet on 30.09.2006 in Jalna case is also not in dispute. The contention put forward is that the supplementary charge-sheet in respect of A-7 in Parbhani case was filed only on 13.11.2008 and on 15.11.2008 in Jalna case and if those two dates with regard to A-7 are taken as the relevant dates, then the requirement of two earlier cases as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) preceding 10 years period was not satisfied, inasmuch as, the date of third occurrence was 29.09.2008 and the date of charge-sheets as against the A-7 were subsequent to that date and not earlier. The said crucial factor is required to be determined to decide the contention raised on behalf of the appellants. In this context reliance was placed upon the decisions in Ajit Kumar Palit (supra) and Dilawar Singh (supra) on behalf of the appellants. That apart, reference was also made to Section 173(2)(i)(a) and 173(8) to contend that cognizance referred to in context of MCOCA would only relate to the offender and not to the offence as prescribed under Section 190(1)(b).\n",
      "Paragraph 110: As against the above submissions Mr. Anil Singh, learned ASG appearing for respondent-State and Mr. Mariarputham, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Maharashtra and NIA contended that the relevant dates are the first charge-sheet filed in Parbhani case on 07.09.2006 and in Jalna case on 30.09.2006. Reliance was placed upon the decisions in R.R. Chari (supra), Raghbans Dubey (supra), Darshan Singh Ram Kishan (supra), Salap Service Station (supra), CREF Finance Limited (supra), Pastor P. Raju (supra), Videocon International Ltd. (supra) and Fakhruddin Ahmad (supra) in support of the submission. Reliance was also placed upon Section 190 Cr.P.C. to contend that cognizance of offence is relevant and not the offender and, therefore, the initial date of cognizance taken by the Chief Judicial Magistrate on the above dates in respect of Parbhani and Jalna will hold good for invoking MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 111: It was also contended that cognizance is an act which a Court when first apply its judicial mind with a view to proceed with the matter and, therefore, when in Parbhani and Jalna by virtue of Section 190 read along with Section 173 based on the report of the police when the first charge- sheet was filed on 07.09.2006 and 30.09.2006 respectively in Parbhani and Jalna, the requirement of taking cognizance by the Competent Court in respect of offences under the Indian Penal Code which alone was relevant in respect of the two earlier cases was satisfied and nothing more was required to be shown. Further reliance was placed upon R.R. Chari (supra), Darshan Singh Ram Kishan (supra), Mohd. Khalid (supra), Mona Panwar (supra) and Sarah Mathew (supra) in support of the above submissions.\n",
      "Paragraph 112: Keeping the respective submissions of the learned counsel in mind when we examine the said issue, in the first instance we wish to refer to relevant provisions touching upon this issue, namely, Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA and Section 173(2) and (8) as well as Sections 190 and 193 of Criminal Procedure Code. When we refer to Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' is defined to mean an activity prohibited by law and that it should be a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment of three years or more. For the purpose of ascertaining the issue relating to cognizance, the other part of the said definition which requires to be noted is that more than one charge-sheet should have been filed before a Competent Court within the preceding period of 10 years and that Court should have taken cognizance of such offence. The offence should alleged to have been committed either singly or jointly as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on its behalf. In so far as the offences are concerned, if the offence would attract a punishment of three years or more that would suffice for falling within the said definition. The charge-sheet should have been filed before a Competent Court with reference to such offence against the offenders.\n",
      "Paragraph 113: One of the contentions raised and which was countered by the respondents was that such two earlier offences should also satisfy the other requirements stipulated under MCOCA, namely, as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on behalf of an organized crime syndicate either singly or jointly. A strict interpretation of Section 2(1)(d) would definitely mean the fulfillment of such requirement since the definition specifically reads to the effect 'undertaken either singly or jointly as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate'. Therefore, even if the earlier offences were not initiated under the provisions of MCOCA such initiations should have been capable of being brought within the provisions of MCOCA, namely, as part of an activity of an organized crime syndicate either by its own members either singly or jointly or though not as a member but such participation should have been on behalf of an 'organized crime syndicate'. As far as filing of the charge-sheet is concerned what all it refers to is such filing before a Competent Court and that Court should have taken cognizance of such offence.\n",
      "Paragraph 114: A minute reference to the said Section, therefore, shows that in the event of the fulfillment of the rest of the requirements, namely, the nature of offence providing for punishment of three years and more, the involvement of the offender as required under the said definition, when it comes to the question of filing of the charge-sheet, the requirement of such filing should be before a competent court within a period preceding 10 years and that such court has taken cognizance of such offence. Significantly, when it comes to the question of fulfillment of the requirement of cognizance what is prescribed is the cognizance of such offence and not the offender.\n",
      "Paragraph 115: As far as the court is concerned, here again the specific reference used is 'competent court' and not 'Sessions Court'. Therefore, keeping aside the rest of the requirements to be fulfilled under Section 2(1)(d) for the present, when we consider the requirement of filing of the charge-sheet before the Competent Court and such Court taking cognizance of such offence, it can be stated without any scope of controversy that two earlier cases which would attract a punishment of more than three years and prohibited by law, undertaken singly or jointly as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on its behalf, if more than one charge-sheet is filed in respect of such offence before the Competent Court and the said Court had taken cognizance of such offence, the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\" would be satisfied.\n",
      "Paragraph 116: Keeping the said prescription of the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\" under Section 2(1)(d) in mind when we examine the question as to taking of cognizance and the Competent Court before whom more than one charge- sheet to be filed, there is no other provision under MCOCA which deals with or prescribes any stipulation for fulfillment of the said requirement. We have to, therefore, necessarily fall back upon the provisions contained in the Criminal Procedure Code. For that purpose reference to Sections 173, 190 and 193 have to be noted. Under Section 173(2)(i), it is stipulated that as soon as the investigation is completed, the officer in-charge of the Police Station should forward to the Magistrate who is empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report in the form prescribed by the State Government, which should contain among other things the names of the parties, the nature of information, the names of the persons who appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case and various other details.\n",
      "Paragraph 117: When we read the said Section 173(2)(i) along with Section 190 of Cr.P.C., it can be seen that any Magistrate of the first class or any Magistrate of the second class specially empowered as provided under sub-section (2) of the said Section may take cognizance of any offence upon a police report of such facts. Therefore, reading Section 173(2)(i) along with Section 190(1)(b), a duty is cast upon the officer in-charge of the police station mandatorily to forward to the Magistrate who is empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report. Under Section 190(1)(b) any Magistrate of the first class and for that matter any Magistrate of second class who is empowered by the Chief Judicial Magistrate for taking cognizance under sub-Section (1) can take cognizance of any offence based on filing of a police report furnished with the facts as stipulated under Section 173(2)(i) (a to h). A conjoint reading of Section 173(2)(i) and Section 190(1)(b), therefore, makes the position crystal clear that taking of cognizance of any offence by a Magistrate of the First Class or the Second Class subject to empowerment created under sub- Section (2) of Section 190 can take cognizance upon a police report. It can be emphasized here that under Section 190 (1) (b) where the Police Report as stated in Section 173(2) (i) is filed before a Magistrate under Section 190(1) (b), irrespective of the nature of offence, the said Magistrate has been invested with all the powers to take cognizance by applying his judicial mind. To be more precise, once the Police Report is filed before a judicial Magistrate as prescribed under Section 190(1) (b), who has been invested with the judicial authority to take cognizance of any offence in the first instance, the requirement of taking cognizance gets fulfilled at that very moment. Further the very fact that proceedings pertaining to Parbhani and Jalna were pending before the Magistrate where such proceedings were initiated by the filing of the police report till the occurrence in Malegaon took place itself was sufficient to demonstrate that judicial mind was very much applied to the proceedings based on the police report consequent upon cognizance taken.\n",
      "Paragraph 118: Keeping the said prescription of law in mind, when we apply the requirement as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA, without straining any further on this question, it can be safely held that the requirement of filing of the charge-sheet in two earlier cases before the competent court in respect of an offence stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) can be held to be satisfied once cognizance is taken by a Judicial Magistrate of first class or for that matter an empowered second class Magistrate, in the event of filing of a police report as prescribed under Section 173(2)(i) by virtue of the power vested under Section 190(1)(b) of Cr.P.C. If the ingredients of the above requirements are fulfilled it will have to be held, that that part of the requirement under Section 2(1)(d), namely, the competent court taking cognizance of the offence as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) in respect of two earlier cases will get fulfilled.\n",
      "Paragraph 119: Once we steer clear of the said legal position, to emphasize further, we also wish to refer to Section 193 Cr.P.C. the caption of which specifically states \"Cognizance of offences by Courts of Session\". The said Section is negatively couched and states that except as otherwise expressly provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, no Court of Session shall take cognizance of any offence as a Court of Original Jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under this Code. For our purpose of ascertaining the requirement of competent court and cognizance stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA, we find that under Section 193, the Court of Session can take hold of the case as a Court of Original Jurisdiction only after committal order is passed to it by a Magistrate under the provisions of Cr.P.C., whereas under Section 190(1)(b), the power of a Magistrate has been pithily stated to mean that he can take cognizance of any offence subject to the fulfillment of the requirements (a), (b) and (c) and no further.\n",
      "Paragraph 120: We are now pitted with the question as to whether the taking of cognizance of the offence by the Competent Court under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA is referable only to the Court of Sessions or even to a Magistrate of first class under Section 190. In this context, when we read Section 2(1)(d) along with 190 and 193 in the absence of any specific stipulation either under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA or any other provision under the said Act in the ordinary course of interpretation it can be validly stated that on fulfillment of Section 190, when a Judicial Magistrate of first class or an empowered second class Magistrate, takes cognizance of any offence that would fulfill the requirement of Section 2(1)(d) relating to competent court. We have noted under MCOCA that beyond what has been stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) there is no other provision dealing with the matter relating to a Competent Court for the purpose of taking cognizance. When under the provisions of Cr.P.C., Judicial Magistrate of first class has been empowered to take cognizance of any offence based on a Police Report, we fail to see any hurdle to state that on taking cognizance in that manner, the said court should be held to be the competent court for satisfying the requirement of Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA. In this respect, we will have to bear in mind that the implication of MCOCA would come into play only after the third occurrence takes place and only after that it will have to be seen whether on the earlier two such occasions involvement of someone jointly or singly, either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on its behalf indulged in a crime in respect of which a charge- sheet has already been filed before the Competent Court which Court had taken cognizance of such offence.\n",
      "Paragraph 121: Therefore, we are able to state the legal position without any ambiguity to the effect that in the event of a Judicial first class Magistrate or an empowered second class Magistrate having taken cognizance of an offence based on a police report as stipulated under Section 173(2)(i), such cognizance of an offence would fulfill the requirement of that part of the definition under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA. Once we are able to ascertain the said legal position by way of strict interpretation, without any ambiguity, we also wish to refer to various decisions relied upon by either party to note whether there is any scope of contradiction with reference to said legal position.\n",
      "Paragraph 122: Mr. Lalit, learned counsel in the course of his submissions relied upon [?CITATION?] and another \\- [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] In the said decision with reference to the expression 'cognizance' a three- Judge Bench of this Court has explained what is really meant by the said expression in the following words in paragraph 19:\n",
      "Paragraph 123: \"......The word \"cognizance\" has no esoteric or mystic significance in criminal law or procedure. It merely means-become aware of and when used with reference to a court or Judge, to take notice of judicially. It was stated in [?CITATION?] by the learned Judges of the Patna High Court in a passage quoted with approval by this Court in [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] [?CITATION?]; [?CITATION?] that the word \"cognizance\" was used in the Code to indicate the point when the Magistrate or Judge takes judicial notice of an offence and that it was a word of indefinite import, and is not perhaps always used in exactly the same sense. As observed in [?CITATION?] at page 416, \"taking cognizance does not involve any formal action; or indeed action of any kind, but occurs as soon as a Magistrate, as such, applies his mind to the suspected commission of an offence\". Where the statute proscribes the materials on which alone the judicial mind shall operate before any step is taken, obviously the statutory requirement must be fulfilled......\"\n",
      "Paragraph 124: (Emphasis added) In the above extracted portion the reference made to the earlier judgment in R.R. Chari's case reported in R.R. Chari (supra) at page 210 that the word 'cognizance' was used in the Court to indicate the point when the Magistrate or Judge takes judicial notice of an offence throws sufficient light to state that at that very moment when a Magistrate takes judicial notice of an offence, the requirement of cognizance of such offence will get fulfilled. Therefore, the said decision also fully supports our conclusion on the question of taking cognizance by the competent Court.\n",
      "Paragraph 125: Reliance was then placed upon the decision in Dilawar Singh (supra) in particular paragraph 8. The said paragraph 8 reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 126: \"8\\. The contention raised by learned counsel for the respondent that a court takes cognizance of an offence and not of an offender holds good when a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence under Section 190 CrPC. The observations made by this Court in Raghubans Dubey v. State of Bihar were also made in that context. The Prevention of Corruption Act is a special statute and as the preamble shows, this Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the prevention of corruption and for matters connected therewith. Here, the principle expressed in the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant would apply which means that if a special provision has been made on a certain matter, that matter is excluded from the general provisions. (See Godde Venkateswara Rao v. Govt. of A.P., State of Bihar v. Dr. Yogendra Singh and Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education v. Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth.) Therefore, the provisions of Section 19 of the Act will have an overriding effect over the general provisions contained in Section 190 or 319 CrPC. A Special Judge while trying an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, cannot summon another person and proceed against him in the purported exercise of power under Section 319 CrPC if no sanction has been granted by the appropriate authority for prosecution of such a person as the existence of a sanction is sine qua non for taking cognizance of the offence qua that person.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 127: (Emphasis added) By relying upon the said part of the decision it was contended that taking 'cognizance of an offence' cannot be the universal rule and that under special circumstances such cognizance of offence would be qua that person, namely, the offender. It is true that in the said decision while dealing with the requirement of sanction under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act with reference to an offence under Section 13(2) of the said Act, this Court did say that in the absence of a sanction under Section 19 the taking of cognizance of the offence qua that person cannot be held to have been made out. When we apply the said decision, it must be stated that it was laid in the context of an offence under Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act which Act specifically stipulates the requirement of prior sanction under Section 19 for proceeding against a public servant by way of a sanction and, therefore, it was held that Section 19 of the Act will have an overriding effect over the general provisions contained in Section 190 or 319 of Cr.P.C. For the fulfillment of the requirement to be complied with under Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA, for ascertaining a 'continuing unlawful activity' in the absence of any such restriction as stipulated under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act under the provisions of MCOCA we have found that Section 190 will have every effect insofar as taking of cognizance by a competent Court is concerned as stipulated under Section 2(1)(d) and, therefore, as held by us on compliance of the said requirement under Section 190, namely, cognizance of the offence by the competent Magistrate, that part of the requirement under Section 2(1)(d) will get automatically fulfilled.\n",
      "Paragraph 128: Reliance was then placed upon the decision in Fakhruddin Ahmad (supra), in particular paragraph 17. The said paragraph 17 reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 129: \"17\\. Nevertheless, it is well settled that before a Magistrate can be said to have taken cognizance of an offence, it is imperative that he must have taken notice of the accusations and applied his mind to the allegations made in the complaint or in the police report or the information received from a source other than a police report, as the case may be, and the material filed therewith. It needs little emphasis that it is only when the Magistrate applies his mind and is satisfied that the allegations, if proved, would constitute an offence and decides to initiate proceedings against the alleged offender, that it can be positively stated that he has taken cognizance of the offence. Cognizance is in regard to the offence and not the offender.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 130: (emphasis added) Even here this Court has stated in uncontroverted terms that once the Magistrate applies his mind to the offence alleged and decides to initiate proceedings against the alleged offender, it can be stated that he has taken cognizance of the offence and by way of reiteration. It is further stated that cognizance is in regard to the offence and not the offender.\n",
      "Paragraph 131: This decision, therefore, reinforces the position that cognizance is mainly of the offence and not the offender.\n",
      "Paragraph 132: In R.R. Chari (supra), in paragraph 8, this Court made it clear that the word 'cognizance' is used by the Court to indicate the point when the Magistrate or a Judge first takes judicial notice of an offence. Therefore, primarily cognizance of an offence takes place when a Judicial Magistrate applies his mind and takes judicial notice of the offence. In fact that is what has been even statutorily stipulated under Section 190(1) of Cr.P.C.\n",
      "Paragraph 133: In Darshan Singh Ram Kishan (supra), in paragraph 8, with particular reference to Section 190, this Court has held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 134: \"8\\. As provided by Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a Magistrate may take cognizance of an offence either, (a) upon receiving a complaint, or (b) upon a police report, or (c) upon information received from a person other than a police officer or even upon his own information or suspicion that such an offence has been committed. As has often been held, taking cognizance does not involve any formal action or indeed action of any kind but occurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind to the suspected commission of an offence. Cognizance, therefore, takes place at a point when a Magistrate first takes judicial notice of an offence. This is the position whether the Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence on a complaint, or on a police report, or upon information of a person other than a police officer. Therefore, when a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence upon a police report, prima facie he does so of the offence or offences disclosed in such report.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 135: (emphasis added) The above passage referred to in the said decision makes the position explicitly clear that cognizance would take place at a point when a Magistrate first takes judicial notice of the offence either on a complaint or on a police report or upon information of a person other than the police officer. Taking judicial notice is nothing but pursuing the report of the police officer, proceeding further on that report by opening the file and thereafter taking further steps to ensure the presence of the accused and all other consequential steps including at a later stage depending upon the nature of offence alleged to pass necessary order of committal to Court of Sessions.\n",
      "Paragraph 136: In Salap Service Station (supra), the question as to what is the implication of a supplementary report filed by the investigating agency under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. was considered. While dealing with the same, it has been stated as under in paragraph 2:\n",
      "Paragraph 137: 2.....It may be mentioned here that in the supplementary charge-sheet allegations are to the effect that there was violation of Direction 12 of the Control Order. The question of taking cognizance does not arise at this stage since cognizance has already been taken on the basis of the main charge-sheet. What all Section 173(8) lays down is that the investigating agency can carry on further investigation in respect of the offence after a report under sub- section (2) has been filed. The further investigation may also disclose some fresh offences but connected with the transaction which is the subject-matter of the earlier report..............The purpose of sub- section (8) of Section 173 CrPC is to enable the investigating agency to gather further evidence and that cannot be frustrated. If the materials incorporated in the supplementary charge-sheet do not make out any offence, the question of framing any other charge on the basis of that may not arise but in case the court frames a charge it is open to the accused persons to seek discharge in respect of that offence also as they have done already in respect of the offence disclosed in the main charge-sheet. The rejection of the report outright at that stage in our view is not correct.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 138: (emphasis added) The above statement of law with particular reference to Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. makes the position much more clear to the effect that the filing of the supplementary charge-sheet does not and will not amount to taking cognizance by the Court afresh against whomsoever again with reference to the very same offence. What all it states is that by virtue of the supplementary charge-sheet further offence may also be alleged and charge to that effect may be filed. In fact, going by Section 173(8) it can be stated like in our case by way of supplementary charge-sheet some more accused may also be added to the offence with reference to which cognizance is already taken by the Judicial Magistrate. While cognizance is already taken of the main offence against the accused already arrayed, the supplementary charge- sheet may provide scope for taking cognizance of additional charges or against more accused with reference to the offence already taken cognizance of and the only scope would be for the added offender to seek for discharge after the filing of the supplementary charge- sheet against the said offender.\n",
      "Paragraph 139: In CREF Finance Limited (supra) paragraph 10 is relevant wherein this Court has held as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 140: 10......Cognizance is taken of the offence and not of the offender and, therefore, once the court on perusal of the complaint is satisfied that the complaint discloses the commission of an offence and there is no reason to reject the complaint at that stage, and proceeds further in the matter, it must be held to have taken cognizance of the offence. One should not confuse taking of cognizance with issuance of process. Cognizance is taken at the initial stage when the Magistrate peruses the complaint with a view to ascertain whether the commission of any offence is disclosed......\"\n",
      "Paragraph 141: (emphasis added) The said statement of law reinforces the legal position that cognizance is always of the offence and not the offender and once the Magistrate applies his judicial mind with reference to the commission of an offence the cognizance is taken at that very moment.\n",
      "Paragraph 142: To the very same effect is the judgment in Pastor P. Raju (supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 143: Paragraph 13 is relevant for our purpose, which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 144: \"13\\. It is necessary to mention here that taking cognizance of an offence is not the same thing as issuance of process. Cognizance is taken at the initial stage when the Magistrate applies his judicial mind to the facts mentioned in a complaint or to a police report or upon information received from any other person that an offence has been committed. The issuance of process is at a subsequent stage when after considering the material placed before it the court decides to proceed against the offenders against whom a prima facie case is made out.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 145: (emphasis added) The above principle has been reiterated again in Videocon International Ltd. (supra) in paragraph 19. Paragraph 19 can be usefully extracted, which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 146: \"19\\. The expression \"cognizance\" has not been defined in the Code. But the word (cognizance) is of indefinite import. It has no esoteric or mystic significance in criminal law. It merely means \"become aware of\" and when used with reference to a court or a Judge, it connotes \"to take notice of judicially\". It indicates the point when a court or a Magistrate takes judicial notice of an offence with a view to initiating proceedings in respect of such offence said to have been committed by someone.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 147: (emphasis added) In Mona Panwar (supra) at paragraph 19 what is meant by 'taking cognizance' has been explained as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 148: \"19\\. The phrase \"taking cognizance of\" means cognizance of an offence and not of the offender. Taking cognizance does not involve any formal action or indeed action of any kind but occurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind to the suspected commission of an offence. Cognizance, therefore, takes place at a point when a Magistrate first takes judicial notice of an offence. This is the position whether the Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence on a complaint or on a police report or upon information of a person other than a police officer. Before the Magistrate can be said to have taken cognizance of an offence under Section 190(1)(b) of the Code, he must have not only applied his mind to the contents of the complaint presented before him, but must have done so for the purpose of proceeding under Section 200 and the provisions following that section. However, when the Magistrate had applied his mind only for ordering an investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code or issued a warrant for the purposes of investigation, he cannot be said to have taken cognizance of an offence.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 149: (emphasis added) The above statement of law makes the position amply clear that cognizance is of an offence and not of the offender, that it does not involve any formal action and as soon as the Magistrate applies his judicial mind to the suspected commission of offence, cognizance takes place.\n",
      "Paragraph 150: Again in a recent decision of this Court in Sarah Mathew (supra) in paragraph 34, the position has been reiterated as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 151: \"34\\. Thus, a Magistrate takes cognizance when he applies his mind or takes judicial notice of an offence with a view to initiating proceedings in respect of offence which is said to have been committed. This is the special connotation acquired by the term \"cognizance\" and it has to be given the same meaning wherever it appears in Chapter XXXVI. It bears repetition to state that taking cognizance is entirely an act of the Magistrate. Taking cognizance may be delayed because of several reasons. It may be delayed because of systemic reasons. It may be delayed because of the Magistrate's personal reasons.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 152: Therefore, having regard to the overwhelming decisions of this Court in having repeatedly expressed what is meant by cognizance and in majority of the decisions by making specific reference to Section 190, we are clear that the interpretation has to be to the cognizance of the offence to be taken note of by the Judicial Magistrate as prescribed under Section 190 and if it takes place that would satisfy and fulfill the requirement of cognizance of offence by the filing of more than one charge-sheet before the Competent Court as stipulated in Section 2(1)(d) of MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 153: Having considered the scope of the definition of \"continuing unlawful activity\" as defined under Section 2(1)(d) with reference to the competent court and the cognizance of more than one earlier case, when we apply the said principles to the facts of this case, as noted in the initial part of this judgment, the two earlier cases were the bomb blast in Parbhani and Jalna. In Parbhani, the occurrence was on 21.11.2003 and in Jalna it was on 27.08.2004. In the Parbhani case, the first charge-sheet was filed as early as on 07.09.2006 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate and in Jalna it was filed on 30.09.2006 before the concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate and in both the cases, cognizance was taken and the proceedings before the respective Magistrates concerned were continued. Therefore, having regard to our conclusion that the cognizance taken by the Judicial Magistrate under Section 190(1) of Cr.P.C. based on the police report under Section 173(2)(i) of Cr.P.C. the same would fulfill the requirement of 'cognizance' as well as, the 'competent court'. It will have to be, therefore, held that to that extent, the definition under Section 2(1)(d) relating to \"continuing unlawful activity\" in respect of more than one case of an offence punishable for more than three years is fully satisfied. Once we come to the said conclusion, we do not find any substance in the third submission of the appellants that cognizance by competent court would only mean cognizance of such offences which can be dealt with only by the Sessions Court and not by a Judicial Magistrate. Therefore, the said submission that the cognizance was taken by Sessions Court much later after its committal (i.e.) in the case of Parbhani only on 29.04.2009 that is after the bomb blast in Malegaon and thereby the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' in respect of more than one case under Section 2(1)(d) is not satisfied cannot be accepted. The said submission, therefore, deserves to be rejected.\n",
      "Paragraph 154: The next submission made on behalf of the appellants was that in order to constitute the earlier two offences to fall within the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' for invoking the provisions of MCOCA after the third occurrence, the involvement of the accused must have been by the same gang. In other words, even if it were to be held that a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' singly or jointly participated or on behalf of an 'organized crime syndicate' with reference to such participation taken place, what is to be ensured is that in all the three cases the same gang, namely, the 'organized crime syndicate' must have been involved. Based on the said contention it was submitted that in the case on hand after A-7 was arrested on 02.11.2008 he was produced in Parbhani case on 11.11.2008 and supplementary charge-sheet was filed against him on 13.11.2008 and in Jalna case a supplementary charge-sheet was filed on 15.11.2008 while none of the other accused had any role to play either in Parbhani or in Jalna, nor was the so- called 'Abhinav Bharat' was involved in either Parbhani or Jalna occurrences. The contention was that though A-7 was implicated both in Parbhani and Jalna such implication was not in pursuance of his role as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' pertaining to Malegaon bomb blast nor was the position that the gang involved in Malegaon blast was also responsible for the bomb blast in Parbhani and Jalna. It is, therefore, contended that even as regards to A-7 he only alleged to have gathered certain materials and procured at the request of one Devle who was the prime accused in Parbhani and Jalna. It was contended that even as per the counter affidavit of the second respondent herein there was no nexus shown for the involvement of any of the accused in the Malegaon bomb blast case to do anything with Parbhani or Jalna bomb blast either individually or jointly as a member of gang or on behalf of the gang.\n",
      "Paragraph 155: In this context, reliance was placed upon the decision in Lalit Somdatta Nagpal & Anr. (supra). A similar contention was raised before this Court in that case to the effect that isolated incidents spread over a period of 10 years involving different types of offences would not attract the provisions of MCOCA and that such activity must be such as to have a link from the first to the last offence alleged to have been undertaken in an organized manner by an organized crime syndicate. The contention was that continuing unlawful activity would necessarily mean continuous engagement in unlawful activity where there would be a live link between all the different offences alleged. The said contention was refuted on behalf of the State in the said case by contending that no live link need exist between the different cases for the application of MCOCA and that such nexus theory was not contemplated by the legislature. While dealing with the said contention, this Court in the facts of that case held as under in paragraph 63:\n",
      "Paragraph 156: \"63\\. As has been repeatedly emphasised on behalf of all the parties, the offence under MCOCA must comprise continuing unlawful activity relating to organised crime undertaken by an individual singly or jointly, either as a member of the organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate by use of coercive or other unlawful means with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. In the instant case, both Lalit Somdatta Nagpal and Anil Somdatta Nagpal have been shown to have been involved in several cases of a similar nature which are pending trial or are under investigation. As far as Kapil Nagpal is concerned, his involvement has been shown only in respect of CR No. 25 of 2003 of Rasayani Police Station, Raigad, under Sections 468, 420 and 34 of the Penal Code and Sections 3, 7, 9 and 10 of the Essential Commodities Act. In our view, the facts as disclosed justified the application of the provisions of MCOCA to Lalit Nagpal and Anil Nagpal. However, the said ingredients are not available as far as Kapil Nagpal is concerned, since he has not been shown to be involved in any continuing unlawful activity. Furthermore, in the approval that was given by the Special Inspector General of Police, Kolhapur Range, granting approval to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Enforcement), Crime Branch, CID, Mumbai to commence investigation under Section 23(1) of MCOCA, Kapil Nagpal has not been mentioned. It is only at a later stage with the registering of CR No. 25 of 2003 of Rasayani Police Station, Raigad, that Kapil Nagpal was roped in with Lalit Nagpal and Somdatta Nagpal and permission was granted to apply the provisions of MCOCA to him as well by order dated 22-8-2005.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 157: (underlining is ours) When we refer to the said line of reasoning stated therein, we find that in the case of one accused, namely, one Kapil Nagpal, since he was not shown to be involved in any of the earlier cases, his case required to be dealt with differently and he cannot be said to have been involved in any continuing unlawful activity. We do not find any other specific reason for excluding him.\n",
      "Paragraph 158: In this context a three Judge Bench decision of this Court, which throws much light on this issue is Ranjitsing Brahamjeetsing Sharma (supra).\n",
      "Paragraph 159: Paragraphs 31, 36 and 37 are relevant for our purpose which read as under.\n",
      "Paragraph 160: \"31\\. The High Court does not say that the appellant has abetted Telgi or had conspired with him. The findings of the High Court as against the appellant are attributable to allegations of abetting Kamat and Mulani.\n",
      "Paragraph 161: Both Kamat and Mulani were public servants. They may or may not have any direct role to play as regards commission of an organised crime but unless a [pic]nexus with an accused who is a member of the organised crime syndicate or an offence in the nature of organised crime is established, only by showing some alleged indulgence to Kamat or Mulani, the appellant cannot be said to have conspired or abetted commission of an organised crime. Prima facie, therefore, we are of the view that Section 3(2) of MCOCA is not attracted in the instant case.\n",
      "Paragraph 162: 36\\. Does this statute require that before a person is released on bail, the court, albeit prima facie, must come to the conclusion that he is not guilty of such offence? Is it necessary for the court to record such a finding? Would there be any machinery available to the court to ascertain that once the accused is enlarged on bail, he would not commit any offence whatsoever?\n",
      "Paragraph 163: 37\\. Such findings are required to be recorded only for the purpose of arriving at an objective finding on the basis of materials on record only for grant of bail and for no other purpose.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 164: (emphasis added) A reading of paragraph 31 shows that in order to invoke MCOCA even if a person may or may not have any direct role to play as regards the commission of an organized crime, if a nexus either with an accused who is a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or with the offence in the nature of an 'organized crime' is established that would attract the invocation of Section 3(2) of MCOCA. Therefore, even if one may not have any direct role to play relating to the commission of an 'organized crime', but when the nexus of such person with an accused who is a member of the 'organized crime syndicate' or such nexus is related to the offence in the nature of 'organized crime' is established by showing his involvement with the accused or the offence in the nature of such 'organized crime', that by itself would attract the provisions of MCOCA. The said statement of law by this Court, therefore, makes the position clear as to in what circumstances MCOCA can be applied in respect of a person depending upon his involvement in an organized crime in the manner set out in the said paragraph. In paragraphs 36 and 37, it was made further clear that such an analysis to be made to ascertain the invocation of MCOCA against a person need not necessarily go to the extent for holding a person guilty of such offence and that even a finding to that extent need not be recorded. But such findings have to be necessarily recorded for the purpose of arriving at an objective finding on the basis of materials on record only for the limited purpose of grant of bail and not for any other purpose. Such a requirement is, therefore, imminent under Section 21(4)(b) of MCOCA.\n",
      "Paragraph 165: Having regard to the said legal position with reference to the requirement to be fulfilled in respect of an 'organized crime' with particular reference to the past two instances and the present one in order to find out as to whether a person was involved in a 'continuing unlawful activity', when we refer to the facts before us, in the case on hand insofar as A-7 Rakesh Dattaray Dhawade is concerned, he has been charge- sheeted in Parbhani, Jalna as well as, the Malegaon bomb blast. The materials available on record disclose that he furnished certain materials at the asking of the prime accused involved in Parbhani and Jalna, which also related to bomb blasts in both the places. Going by the charge-sheet filed against A-7 in Malegaon his direct involvement has been alleged. A conspectus consideration of the above facts discloses that insofar as A-7 was concerned, he had a nexus with the member of an 'organized crime syndicate' and also had every nexus with the offence in the nature of an 'organized crime' of the two earlier cases, namely, Parbhani and Jalna and also direct involvement in the present bomb blast at Malegaon. In such circumstances, there is no difficulty in coming to a definite conclusion that insofar as, A-7 is concerned, his activity and involvement in all the three occurrences, namely, Parbhani, Jalna and Malegaon disclose nexus with the crime and also with the other accused involved in the crime and thereby the satisfaction of the definition of 'continuing unlawful activity' of an 'organized crime' on behalf of an 'organized crime syndicate' is satisfactorily shown. In such circumstances, by virtue of Section 21 (4) of MCOCA he is not entitled for the grant of bail and that he does not fall within the excepted category stipulated in sub-clause (a) or (b) of the said sub-Section (4) of Section 21.\n",
      "Paragraph 166: Having stated the said position relating to A-7, when we come to the case of others, there is no dispute that in respect of other appellants, their involvement is with reference to the present occurrence, namely, Malegaon bomb blast. Admittedly they are not proceeded against for the offence relating to Parbhani and Jalna. But still at the present juncture, with the materials available on record as on date, we are not in a position to ascertain as to the involvement of the appellants either by way of their nexus with any accused who is a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or such nexus with the offence of an 'organized crime' which pertains to Parbhani and Jalna. We cannot also rule out the possibility of the evidence based on the investigation by the prosecuting agency to come out with reliable materials in support of such nexus to be shown with an accused or with the crime in respect of the earlier two cases, namely, Parbhani and Jalna. We cannot, therefore, declare to the extent as was done by the Special Judge in the order dated 31.07.2009 to straightway reach at a conclusion to the effect that MCOCA was not attracted and, therefore, they should be discharged.\n",
      "Paragraph 167: But, for the purpose of the requirement under Section 21(4) (b) having regard to the absence of any material as on date to disclose any nexus with the accused of an 'organized crime syndicate' or with the offence in the nature of an 'organized crime', in Parbhani and Jalna as of now we can state that in respect of appellants other than A-7 i.e. appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010, their application for bail can be considered by the Special Court. Therefore, on this issue, namely, in all cases same gang must be involved, our answer is to the above limited extent based on the earlier statement of law as declared in Ranjitsing Brahamjeetsing Sharma (supra) in paragraph 31.\n",
      "Paragraph 168: With that when we come to the next submission, namely, that in order to characterize the past occurrence as well as the present occurrence as an 'organized crime' falling under section 2 (1) (e) of MCOCA, in each of such occurrence, violence should have played a key role and that such violence etc. should have been for pecuniary gain. The submission was made on behalf of the appellants that there was no material to show that any of the appellants had any pecuniary advantage from anybody. The contention was that all the attributes of Section 2(1)(e), namely, an 'organized crime' must be present in all the three cases. It was further contended that in the occurrence relating to Parbhani and Jalna, there was no allegation of pecuniary advantage and they were all just mere cases of violence. It was, also contended that 'promoting insurgency' was also not the specific case of the prosecution in all the three cases, even assuming it may arise in Malegaon blast, the same was not present in Parbhani or Jalna.\n",
      "Paragraph 169: To appreciate the said contention, it will be necessary to make a detailed reference to Section 2(1)(e) of MCOCA. As far as the nature of activity is concerned, in Section 2(1)(e), it is stated that 'organized crime' means continuing unlawful activity by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means with the object of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. If we make a detailed reference to the said provision, the use of violence etc. should have been carried out with the object of either gaining pecuniary benefits or for gaining undue economic or other advantage for oneself or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. We find that the violent activity need not necessarily be for pecuniary advantage in all acts of 'continuing unlawful activity'. Indulging in such violent activity can be for gaining pecuniary advantage or for gaining any other undue economic or other advantage or for promoting insurgency. Therefore, at the very outset, we do not find any scope to interpret Section 2(1)(e), namely, an 'organized crime' to mean that in order to come within the said expression indulging in such violent or other activity should always be for pecuniary gain. On the other hand, we can safely hold that such indulgence in violent activity can be either for pecuniary gain or for economic advantage or for any other advantage either for the person who indulged in such activity or for any other person or for promoting insurgency. In that respect, we find that expected benefit for indulging in any violent or related activity could be for any of the above purposes independently and one such purpose may be for promoting insurgency.\n",
      "Paragraph 170: When once we are able to state the definition of 'organized crime' under Section 2(1) (e) with such clear precision, the other question is what is meant by 'promoting insurgency'. In fact, the said expression has already been considered by some of the judgments of this Court, and, therefore, we can make useful reference to those judgments to understand what is insurgency and whether there was any act of insurgency prevalent in the case on hand when the alleged activity of violence etc. alleged against the appellants. The dictionary meaning of expression 'insurgent' is raising an active revolt or a revolutionary. Therefore, going by the dictionary meaning, promoting insurgency would mean creating a revolution and thereby disturb the peaceful atmosphere. In fact, in the decision of this Court in Zameer Ahmad Latifur Rehman Sheikh (supra) a reference has been made to this very expression and has been dealt with in a detailed fashion in paragraphs 26 to 29. We can usefully refer to the said paragraphs to understand the expression insurgency. Paragraphs 26 to 29 are as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 171: \"26\\. The term \"insurgency\" has not been defined either under MCOCA or any other statute. The word \"insurgency\" does not find mention in UAPA even after the 2004 and 2008 Amendments. The definition as submitted by Mr Salve also does not directly or conclusively define the term \"insurgency\" and thus reliance cannot be placed upon it. The appellants would contend that the term refers to rising in active revolt or rebellion. Webster defines it as a condition of revolt against the Government that does not reach the proportion of an organised revolution.\n",
      "Paragraph 172: 27\\. In Sarbananda Sonowal v. Union of India this Court has held that insurgency is undoubtedly a serious form of internal disturbance which causes grave threat to the life of people, creates panic situation and also hampers the growth and economic prosperity of the State.\n",
      "Paragraph 173: 28\\. We feel inclined to adopt the aforesaid definition for the current proceedings as there does not appear to exist any other satisfactory source.\n",
      "Paragraph 174: 29\\. Although the term \"insurgency\" defies a precise definition, yet, it could be understood to mean and cover breakdown of peace and tranquility as also a grave disturbance of public order so as to endanger the security of the State and its sovereignty.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 175: [pic](Emphasis added) It has been more succinctly described in paragraphs 45 to 47 which can also be usefully referred to:\n",
      "Paragraph 176: \"45\\. Now that we have examined under what circumstances a State law can be said to be encroaching upon the law-making powers of the Central Government, we may proceed to evaluate the current issue on merits. Let us once again examine the provision at the core of this matter:\n",
      "Paragraph 177: \"2\\. (1)(e) 'organised crime' means any continuing unlawful activity by an individual, singly or jointly, either as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate, by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion, or other unlawful means, with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits, or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or any other person or promoting insurgency;\"\n",
      "Paragraph 178: After examining this provision at length, we have come to the conclusion that the definition of \"organised crime\" contained in Section 2(1)(e) of MCOCA makes it clear that the phrase \"promoting insurgency\" is used to denote a possible driving force for \"organised crime\". It is evident that MCOCA does not punish \"insurgency\" per se, but punishes those who are guilty of running a crime organisation, one of the motives of which may be the promotion of insurgency.\n",
      "Paragraph 179: 46\\. We may also examine the Statement of Objects and Reasons to support the conclusion arrived at by us. The relevant portion of the Statement of Objects and Reasons is extracted hereinbelow:\n",
      "Paragraph 180: \"1\\. Organised crime has for quite some years now come up as a very serious threat to our society. It knows no national boundaries and is fuelled by illegal wealth generated by contract, killing, extortion, smuggling in contrabands, illegal trade in narcotics, kidnappings for ransom, collection of protection money and money laundering, etc. The illegal wealth and black money generated by the organised crime being very huge, it has had serious adverse effect on our economy. It was seen that the organised criminal syndicates made a common cause with terrorist gangs and foster narcoterrorism which extends beyond the national boundaries. There was reason to believe that organised criminal gangs have been operating in the State and thus, there was immediate need to curb their activities.\n",
      "Paragraph 181: 2\\. The existing legal framework i.e. the penal and procedural laws and the adjudicatory system are found to be rather inadequate to curb or control the menace of organised crime. The Government has, therefore, decided to enact a special law with stringent and deterrent provisions including in certain circumstances power to intercept wire, electronic or oral communication to control the menace of organised crime.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 182: 47\\. We find no merit in the contention that MCOCA, in any way, deals with punishing insurgency directly. We are of the considered view that the legislation only deals with \"insurgency\" indirectly only to bolster the [pic]definition of \"organised crime\". However, even if it be assumed that \"insurgency\" has a larger role to play than pointed out by us above in MCOCA, we are of the considered view that the term \"promoting insurgency\"\n",
      "Paragraph 183: as contemplated under Section 2(1)(e) of MCOCA comes within the concept of public order.\"\n",
      "Paragraph 184: (Emphasis added) Therefore, 'insurgency' has been understood to mean raising an active revolt or rebellion in the common parlance. It is also stated that it could be understood to mean and cover breakdown of peace and tranquility as also a grave disturbance of public order so as to endanger the security of the State and its sovereignty. While making specific reference to Section 2(1)(e), it was pointed out that MCOCA though does not punish insurgency per se, punishes those who are guilty of running a crime organization and one of the motive of which may be the promotion of insurgency. Therefore, it is not necessary that promoting insurgency should always be linked to pecuniary advantage. Whenever an organized gang indulges in a violent act, such indulgence in violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means can be for promoting an insurgency.\n",
      "Paragraph 185: In the light of such line of thinking already expressed by this Court with particular reference to Section 2(1)(e), we do not find any different meaning to be attributed to the definition of 'organized crime', much less to the extent to which the appellants seek to interpret the said definition and state that the indulgence in any violent and related activity for promoting insurgency, the element of pecuniary advantage should be present.\n",
      "Paragraph 186: We, therefore, reject such a contention and hold that indulging in any violent or other related activity by an organized gang and thereby an effort to promote insurgency i.e. to damage the peace and tranquility in the State is made, that by itself would fall within the four corners of the definition of \"organized crime\" under Section 2(1)(e).\n",
      "Paragraph 187: In the light of our above conclusions on the various submissions, we are convinced that in respect of the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971/2010, namely, A-7, there is no scope even for the limited purpose of Section 21(4)(b) to hold that application of MCOCA is doubtful. We have held that the said appellant A-7 had every nexus with all the three crimes, namely, Parbhani, Jalna and Malegaon and, therefore, the bar for grant of bail under Section 21 would clearly operate against him and there is no scope for granting any bail. Insofar as the rest of the appellants are concerned, for the purpose of invoking Section 21(4)(b), namely, to consider their claim for bail, it can be held that for the present juncture with the available materials on record, it is not possible to show any nexus of the appellants who have been proceeded against for their involvement in Malegaon blast with the two earlier cases, namely, Parbhani and Jalna. There is considerable doubt about their involvement in Parbhani and Jalna and, therefore, they are entitled for their bail applications to be considered on merits.\n",
      "Paragraph 188: When once we are able to steer clear of the said position, the other question to be considered is the grant of bail on its own merits. For which purpose, the submission of Mr. Mariarputham, learned senior counsel who appeared for the State of Maharashtra and NIA based on the decision relied upon by him in State of U.P. Through [?CITATION?] should be kept in mind, in particular paragraph 18, which reads as under:\n",
      "Paragraph 189: \"18\\. It is well settled that the matters to be considered in an application for bail are (i) whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the offence; (ii) nature and gravity of the charge; (iii) severity of the punishment in the event of conviction;\n",
      "Paragraph 190: (iv) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing, if released on bail; (v) character, behaviour, means, position and standing of the accused; (vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated; (vii) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with; and (viii) danger, of course, of justice being thwarted by grant of bail [see [?CITATION?]]. While a vague allegation that the accused may tamper with the evidence or witnesses may not be a ground to refuse bail, if the accused is of such character that his mere presence at large would intimidate the witnesses or if there is material to show that he will use his liberty to subvert justice or tamper with the evidence, then bail will be refused. We may also refer to the following principles relating to grant or refusal of bail stated in [?CITATION?]\n",
      "Paragraph 191: 11\\. The law in regard to grant or refusal of bail is very well settled. The court granting bail should exercise its discretion in a judicious manner and not as a matter of course. Though at the stage of granting bail a detailed examination of evidence and elaborate documentation of the merit of the case need not be undertaken, there is a need to indicate in such orders reasons for prima facie concluding why bail was being granted particularly where the accused is charged of having committed a serious offence. Any order devoid of such reasons would suffer from non-application of mind. It is also necessary for the court granting bail to consider among other circumstances, the following factors also before granting bail; they are:\n",
      "Paragraph 192: (a) The nature of accusation and the severity of punishment in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 193: (b) Reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witness or apprehension of threat to the complainant.\n",
      "Paragraph 194: (c) Prima facie satisfaction of the court in support of the charge. (See Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh and Puran v. Rambilas.)\"\n",
      "Paragraph 195: Even the other contentions submitted by the learned senior counsel that the appellants are not entitled for bail, are all matters which the prosecuting agency will have to place before the Special Court for consideration while considering the appellants' application for bail. For the same reason, the various other contentions raised on behalf of the appellant in Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70/2010 as well as the appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8132 of 2010 by making reference to their personal grievances are all matters which will have to be placed before the Special Judge for consideration. We are not expressing any opinion on those aspects and we leave it for the Special Judge to consider the bail application on merits and pass appropriate orders.\n",
      "Paragraph 196: Accordingly, on question No.(a) in paragraph 35, we hold that the judgment of the Division Bench in holding that cognizance is of the offence and not of the offender is perfectly justified and the same does not call for any interference. Therefore, Criminal Appeal Nos.1969-70 of 2010, Criminal Appeal No.1971 of 2010, Criminal Appeal Nos.1994-98 of 2010, appeal arising out of SLP(Crl) No.8132 of 2010 and Criminal Appeal No.58 of 2011 are dismissed. As far as the order dated 30.12.2010, rejecting bail, passed by the learned Special Judge, which was also confirmed by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court by order dated 09.11.2011 in Criminal Bail Application No.333 of 2011 with Criminal Application No.464 of 2011 of the appellant in appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos.9370-71 of 2011, the said orders are set aside with the observation that there is enough scope to doubt as to the application of MCOCA under Section 21(4)(b) for the purpose of grant of bail and consequently the Special Judge is directed to consider the application for bail on merits keeping in mind the observations in paragraphs 100 and 101 of this judgment and pass orders.\n",
      "Paragraph 197: Consequently, the appeals arising out of SLP(Crl.) Nos.9370-71 of 2011 are partly allowed. The order impugned in these appeals is set aside and the application for bail in Bail Application No.42 of 2008 is restored to the file of the Special Judge for passing orders on merits. Similarly, for the reasons stated in paragraph 99, we hold that the appellant in appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8132 of 2010 is also entitled for the same relief as is granted to the appellant for consideration for grant of bail in the appeals arising out of SLP(Crl.) Nos.9370-71 of 2011. We thus answer question No.(b) of paragraph 35 and the trial Court is, therefore, directed to apply the same principle and consider the bail application pending or filed afresh, if so advised, by the appellant in the appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8132 of 2010 and pass orders on merits. Consequently, Criminal Appeal No.1971 of 2010, Criminal Appeal Nos.1994-98 of 2010 and Criminal Appeal No.58 of 2011 are dismissed.\n",
      "Paragraph 198: Since the occurrence is of the year 2008 and nearly seven years have gone by, it is imperative that the Special Court commence the trial at the earliest and conclude the same expeditiously. We direct the Prosecuting Agency to ensure that the necessary evidence i.e. oral, documentary as well as other form of evidence placed before the Court to enable the Special Court to commence the trial early and conclude the same expeditiously. It is stated that no officer has been posted for the Special Court as on date.\n",
      "Paragraph 199: We, therefore, request the Chief Justice of the High Court of Bombay to pass appropriate orders either for posting these cases before a learned Judge by way of special order or appoint a Presiding Officer exclusively for deciding these cases in order to ensure speedy trial. We also direct the Presiding Officer of the Special Court to dispose of the bail applications expeditiously, preferably within one month from the date of his/her assumption of Office as Special Judge. The Registry is directed to transmit the records forthwith.\n",
      "Paragraph 200: Since, we have not heard arguments on the question as to the claim of NIA in seeking custody covered by SLP (Crl.) No.9303 of 2011 and SLP (Crl.) No.9369 of 2011 the same are delinked and shall be listed in due course.\n"
